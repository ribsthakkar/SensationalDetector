VIDEO: Host Breaks Down As He Learns What Muslim Captors Forced Starved Sex Slave To Eat,"June 27, 2017Emily AnnReligion, World News
A woman named Dakhill (left) tells the story of sex slaves held hostage by ISIS (right).
A woman who was held hostage by ISIS was unknowingly forced to eat the unthinkable while being kept in a cell by the fanatics. After ISIS had starved the mother for three days, the Iraqi men served her what she thought was meat and rice, but it was something else entirely — something far worse.
ISIS held a Yazidi Christian mother captive in a cell for three days with no food or water before she was tricked into eating something absolutely cringe-worthy by an evil guard. When she finished her meal, the guard said, “We cooked your one-year-old son that we took from you, and this is what you just ate.”
The faces behind this gruesome act of terror are devil-worshiping men who believe they are worshiping god and carry out unspeakably cruel acts against minorities in the Middle East daily. These men are taking women and children as sex slaves and massacring thousands every day. Anyone who can do something so unimaginable and follow a religion that allows it is one sick individual.
The interviewer wiped away his tears, like anyone being told this horrific story would do, as his guest, identified only as Dakhill, continued with heart-wrenching stories of the captured woman in the Middle East.
“One of the girls said that they took six of her sisters,” she said. She revealed that one little girl, aged just ten, had been raped to death before her father and five sisters.
“The question that we ask yourselves is: ‘Why? Why did these savages do this to us?'” [Source: Daily Mail]
Sadly, this torture is happening to Yazidi women and children all over the Middle East at the hands of savage Muslims, who are practicing Islam just as their prophet Muhammad modeled.
Most of the several hundred thousand members of the minority live in northern Iraq, mainly around Sinjar, a large town which anti-ISIS forces have now retaken but was largely destroyed. In 2014, ISIS jihadists captured Yazidi women and turned them into sex slaves to be sold and exchanged across their self-proclaimed ‘caliphate’.
Around 3,000 of them are believed to remain in captivity. A number of mass Yazidi graves were uncovered in 2015. [source: Hollywood Life]
How one can call something this subhuman “religion” is beyond anyone’s wildest imagination, and anyone doubting that this behavior is Islamic only needs to look to the Quran, where you will easily find justification for sex slavery, rape, murder, and more. If that isn’t enough to convince you, simply look at the actions and life of Muhammad, Islam’s “perfect man,” who was a slave owning, rapist and murdering pedophile.
What is even worse is how someone can get away with such cruel acts that display such inhumanity, but for that, we have the liberal indifference to thank, as they turn a blind eye to these Islamic atrocities in the name of political correctness. As ISIS tries to keep this sick, Muslim tradition alive, attempting to erect a worldwide Islamic caliphate through oppression and terror, people are hopeful reporters like this can continue shedding light on these situations to bring it to an end.
However, it is up to us to make sure the stories are heard since the mainstream media can’t be trusted to bring attention to the uncomfortable truth that is Islam. The sickening details of the torture these women and children have to go through are unimaginable, and it is deserving of our attention. If we don’t speak against it and raise awareness of if, it will only be a matter of time before more Islamic savagery is happening on our very own soil.

Chinese city leadership shake-up signals Xi power play,"Beijing – A sudden leadership change in one of China’s biggest cities has highlighted President Xi Jinping’s ambition to consolidate his grip on power at an upcoming major political gathering, analysts say.
Former Xi aide Chen Miner was named Communist Party chief in Chongqing last weekend, abruptly replacing a politician who was once widely regarded as a contender for promotion to China’s top political body.
The shake-up in the southwestern megalopolis may signal that Xi is manoeuvering to stack the national leadership with his supporters at the Communist Party congress later this year.
During the meeting, Xi is widely expected to secure a second five year term, but what is less clear is who will depart or ascend to the Politburo standing committee, the group of seven politicians who run the world’s second largest economy.
Chen replaced Sun Zhengcai, a member of the 25-person Politburo who was once a favourite for promotion to the standing committee.

Miami judge rules Florida’s new ‘Stand Your Ground’ changes unconstitutional,"Brandon Morse 2 hours
A Miami-Dade judge ruled on Monday that Florida's changes to the ""Stand Your Ground"" law are unconstitutional on the grounds that the changes should have been made by the Supreme Court, and not the Legislature. (Getty Images)
Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Milton Hirsch ruled Monday that Florida’s changes to its existing “Stand Your Ground” law violate the Florida Constitution.
The Miami Herald reported that Hirsch said that under Florida’s constitutional law, the change to the law should have been crafted by Florida’s Supreme Court, not the Legislature.
The change to the law, called the “Self-Defense Immunity,” was signed by Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) in early June, after the bill passed the Senate in May. The new change requires state prosecutors prove the guilt of someone claiming to have shot someone in self defense. Previously, the Florida Supreme Court ruled that under the 2005 self-defense law, those who used a firearm in self defense must prove their innocence.
The so-called “self-defense immunity” was to flip the script, keeping gun owners who discharged their weapons in self-defense from bearing the burden of proof, with the presumption of innocence already on their side.
Opponents of the law considered the bill too burdensome for prosecutors and are calling this ruling a victory, according to the Herald. However, according to Hirsch, the problem with the changes to the law were “procedural,” meaning only the Supreme Court should make them.
“As a matter of constitutional separation of powers, that procedure cannot be legislatively modified,” Hirsch wrote on his decision.
Legislators disagree with Hirsch, however.
“I would be surprised if this decision were upheld at the appellate level,” Sen. Rob Bradley (R), the bill’s creator, told the Herald.
According to the Herald, the ruling is not binding, as other judges may choose to uphold the law. However, it does open the door for an appeals process and a possible reviewing of the law by the Florida Supreme Court.
Kylie Mason, a spokeswoman for Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, told the Orlando Sentinel that Bondi will appeal the order. John Tupps, spokesman for the governor, said that Scott is currently reviewing the order himself.",TheBlaze,1
"Trump, reversing course, wants Senate Republicans to finish Obamacare replacement, but chances remain dim","Michael Reynolds / Getty Images

President Trump resurrected his party’s effort to replace the Affordable Care Act on Wednesday, a day after the Senate legislation collapsed, by abruptly reversing course to push Republican senators to work through their August recess until they pass something.
Trump’s attempt to inject fresh momentum into an effort that has split his party came as a surprise at a White House lunch for the senators, given his defiant statements on Tuesday that he would simply “let Obamacare fail” — a stance that seemed to end the long-running GOP bid to undo his predecessor’s healthcare legacy.
The president’s shift seemed a tacit acknowledgment of the political danger of walking away from a campaign promise he’d made to repeal the law, just as Republicans had vowed for years before him. Yet he also seemed to grasp that simply letting the health insurance program unravel without a replacement was not politically sustainable, now that 20 million Americans depend on it for healthcare coverage.
“For seven years you promised that you would repeal Obamacare,” Trump chided senators as they sat down for lunch.
“Inaction is not an option. And frankly, I don't think we should leave town unless we have a health insurance plan, unless we can give our people great healthcare.”
Despite new interest from the president, who for months has done little to sell the legislation to members of Congress or the public generally, the chances of success remain dim.
Although Trump repeatedly portrayed the Senate as ""close"" to reaching agreement, the 52 Republicans remain deeply divided over healthcare policy and can afford to lose just two votes given the united opposition of Senate Democrats. Top administration officials planned to meet with holdout senators late Wednesday to kick-start negotiations.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) insisted he would push forward with a vote next week to start the legislative debate, but it is not clear he will have the 50 votes needed to proceed.
The inability to clear that hurdle stopped the bill this week. Several Republican senators had said they would vote against even proceeding to debate because they so objected to the legislation that McConnell had brokered behind closed doors. Most were unwilling to simply repeal Obamacare but could not agree with colleagues on alternatives for replacing it.
McConnell, backed by the White House, argued that Republicans had no chance to keep their campaign promise if they didn’t at least start the debate process. He promised that senators would have ample opportunity to offer amendments and shape the final product.
“It's pretty obvious that we've had difficulty getting 50 votes to proceed,” McConnell said after the lunch meeting. “But we cannot have a debate until we get on the bill.”
Or as White House legislative director Marc Short put it: “It's a little bit like Leslie Nielsen in 'Naked Gun,' with an explosion behind you, saying, ‘There's nothing to see here.’”
“If you're not willing to move to proceed,” Short added, “you're basically acknowledging there's nothing wrong, that Obamacare is fine.”
Senators emerged from the White House luncheon seemingly upbeat, but also skeptical that their differences could be resolved in the days ahead.
Conservatives want to fully end the Affordable Care Act, while more centrist senators want to preserve aspects of the law, including its Medicaid expansion in their states.
Republican governors are among the most powerful critics of the overhaul effort in Congress, and key senators, including Dean Heller of Nevada and Rob Portman of Ohio, are not likely to part ways with governors from their own party who have been among the most vocal.
“We’re just going to continue discussions,” Heller told reporters at the Capitol.
Trump used a familiar approach with senators — mixing friendly banter with pointed jibes. At one point, Trump singled out Heller, who was seated to his immediate right at the table and is considered the most endangered Republican senator facing reelection in 2018. The president awkwardly implied Heller could lose his job unless he backed the Obamacare repeal.
“He wants to remain a senator doesn't he?” Trump said, prompting a game smile from Heller.
But for Heller, and others, keeping aspects of the Affordable Care Act in place may be the more politically viable route to reelection in states like his with many beneficiaries.
The Republican legislation would cause a projected 22 million Americans to lose insurance coverage. Simply repealing Obamacare without a replacement would leave 32 million Americans without insurance and also cause premiums to double by 2026, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in an updated reported on Wednesday.
The White House encouraged senators to let the administration know what changes would be needed to win their support. By retaining some of the Obamacare taxes on high-income earners, the Republican bill would preserve revenue that could be used to shore up coverage.
“We're going to spend some more money to make sure everybody is protected,” Trump said.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has emerged as a key architect of the replacement plan with a provision that would allow insurers to offer cheaper, skimpier policies. That won over some Republicans who believe it would lower premium costs for consumers. But others doubt the bare-bones policies would offer adequate coverage, and the insurance industry has pronounced the idea unworkable.
Some Republicans touted a new administration report purporting to show that health insurance premiums would go down, and insurance coverage up, under the Senate GOP approach — contrary to the Congressional Budget Office’s findings. But the report was widely criticized by independent experts who pointed out numerous flaws in its methodology.
“We came from that meeting with a renewed commitment to keep working, keep negotiating, to get to yes,” Cruz said afterward. “In my view, failure is not an option.”
Whether Trump’s revived interest in healthcare will provide the push needed to reach consensus remains uncertain, in part because of the president’s own widely shifting views.
“I don’t know that lunch with 50 or 60 elected officials gets you very far,” said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally.
McConnell had already announced that senators had to forfeit the first two weeks of what was to have been the traditional August recess.
Most Americans say they want Republicans and Democrats to work together to fix Obamacare, rather than repeal it. But that bipartisan approach did not appear to be on the lunch menu at the White House.
With reporters and cameras briefly in the State Dining Room, Trump repeatedly said that President Obama had lied about his signature domestic initiative as Obama worked in 2010 for its passage. Trump also dismissed congressional Democrats as disinterested in working on solutions, though Democratic leaders have repeatedly called on Republicans to work with them to improve the ACA, not repeal it.
Republican senators seemed relieved that Trump had backed off, for now, on his intent to simply “let Obamacare fail.”
“It’s not the responsible thing to do,” said Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who is among the conservatives who have objected to the initial Senate bill. “I think people realize we have to get to a result, because this is what we promised.”

Pro-life group alleges Twitter is suppressing its ads,"Kate Scanlon Jun 27, 2017 5:36 pm
Twitter has been accused by pro-life group Live Action of suppressing its ads. Live Action founder and president Lila Rose said her organization was told by Twitter that their ads were offensive and in violation of its hate speech policy. (2013 file photo/Bethany Clarke/Getty Images)
The pro-life group Live Action accused Twitter on Monday of suppressing its advertisements.
Live Action founder and president Lila Rose said her organization was told by Twitter that its ads were offensive and in violation of Twitter’s hate speech policy.
On its website, Live Action said that Twitter will not allow them to advertise its content “until we delete ALL the tweets it deems offensive — or, in reality, all the tweets that offend Planned Parenthood”:
Twitter has told us that we must delete:
1. all of our tweets calling for the end of taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood,
2. all of our tweets of our undercover investigations into Planned Parenthood, and
3. any ultrasound images of preborn children.
Live Action contrasted its ads with ads from Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider, that were approved by Twitter:
Hey, @Twitter – why is Planned Parenthood allowed to discuss and advertise about defunding while @LiveAction has been blocked? #DefundPP pic.twitter.com/NuSXYbqVkB
— Live Action (@LiveAction) June 27, 2017
Double standard: @PPact is allowed to advertise on @Twitter, but our ads have been blocked until we delete tweets. https://t.co/QlPSItKYFx
— Live Action (@LiveAction) June 27, 2017
.@Twitter's bias against Live Action's pro-life reporting is part of a national trend to suppress content exposing abortion and @PPact.
— Lila Rose (@LilaGraceRose) June 27, 2017
On Monday, Rose told Fox News’ Tucker Carlson that while Planned Parenthood is advertising on Twitter, “Live Action, which is the leading pro-life platform for the pro-life movement, is not allowed to.”
Rose said Twitter characterized Live Action’s ads as a “violation of their hate and sensitive policy.” She said the ads in question “show ultrasound images; they’re fact-checks of Planned Parenthood; they’re discussing the prenatal life and its beauty.”
“These are the sorts of tweets that … Twitter is trying to block,” Rose said.
Rose said that Twitter is “a public company, so this is not something they’re telling their shareholders or they’re telling their users that they’re actually going to be blocking the advertisement of pro-life speech.
“I mean, this is something that they’ve been kind of keeping a secret, and now we’re trying to get this news out there that they’ve been blocking us,” she added.
Rose said she and her organization won’t delete any tweets.
A spokesperson for Twitter did not immediately return  ’s request for comment.
In a statement to Carlson and Fox News, a spokesperson for the company said: “Twitter has clear, transparent rules that every advertiser is required to follow, and the political viewpoints of an organization do not impact how these rules are applied.”",TheBlaze,1
"BREAKING: Jeff Sessions Breaks Silence, Indicts More Than 400 People…","Under Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has been rather quiet in its first few months.
However, that’s quickly changing.
On Thursday, Sessions announced that the DOJ had brought charges against more than 400 people, including 56 doctors, with healthcare fraud, costing taxpayers over a billion dollars.
“Too many trusted medical professionals like doctors, nurses, and pharmacists have chosen to violate their oaths and put greed ahead of their patients,” Sessions told reporters in Washington, D.C. “Amazingly, some have made their practices into multimillion dollar criminal enterprises. They seem oblivious to the disastrous consequences of their greed.”
More than 100 of the 416 defendants are charged with opioid scams in the largest such fraud crackdown in U.S history, he said.
He added that 295 healthcare providers are being suspended or banned from federal health programs as a result of the crackdown.
Six doctors, for example, are accused of prescribing unnecessary opioids in Michigan and billing Medicare for $164 million in false or fraudulent claims, Sessions said. Some of the prescribed drugs were sold illegally on the street.
Another fraudulent rehabilitation facility in Florida allegedly billed the government for $58 million for false tests and treatments., he added. That same facility is accused of luring addicts with gift cards, strip club visits and drugs.

July 17, 2017 9:59 PM
 
Fire investigators said Monday the apartment where a deadly fire began in a Honolulu high-rise was near the two units on the 26th floor where the bodies of three victims were found, but they're still working to determine the cause.
The origin of the fire is unit 2602, Honolulu Fire Department Capt. David Jenkins said. Two women and a man died in two different apartments on the same floor of the 36-story high-rise.
Investigators will determine exactly where in the unit Friday's fire started and what caused it, Jenkins said.
The Marco Polo building was constructed in 1971, before fire sprinklers were required in high-rises. Fire officials say sprinklers would have prevented flames from spreading.
It's one of the worst fires in modern Honolulu history, Jenkins said.
Some residents told The Associated Press they had trouble hearing sirens and didn't realize there was fire raging until opening their doors.
They also said there was no public announcement or flashing alarm lights in the building when the fire began.
""It didn't sound quite like a normal traditional fire alarm,"" said Air Force cyber technician Cory La Roe, who didn't know the building had no sprinklers when he moved in in May. LaRoe said there were no announcements or flashing lights when the fire broke out.
Gordon Kihune, who has lived in the building for about 12 years, said he didn't hear the alarms going off until he opened his apartment door. Angela Kim, a 30th-floor resident, said she can only hear the sirens if her apartment door is open.
A sprinkler system would have confined the blaze to the unit where it started, Honolulu Fire Chief Manuel Neves said.
Douglas Hesley, branch president of Associa Hawaii, the management group that runs the Marco Polo building, declined to comment on past fire drills or safety plans that were in place at the time of the fire.
When asked if an Associated Press reporter could enter the building Saturday afternoon to see the fire damage, Hesley declined and said he was uncertain of the structural integrity of the fire-damaged floors. He said the area was under the control of city police and fire officials. However, the fire department said Monday the scene was released to the building around 1 a.m. Saturday. The police department said it does not consider the burnt floors a crime scene.
Residents were being allowed back in to the high-rise, and at least one ventured into the fire-damaged area without being stopped. A KITV reporter also entered the burnt section of the building Saturday morning. One photo from KITV shows an entrance door to the 26th floor being held open with yellow caution tape, but nothing preventing people from entering.
Calls Monday to Hesley were not returned.
The Honolulu Fire Department said fire inspection reports are part of their investigation and cannot be immediately released.
Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell said the city needs to look at passing a law requiring that older buildings be retrofitted with sprinklers.
""I think we need to put this conversation up on the radar and up for legislative discussion,"" said state Sen. Les Ihara, a Democrat. ""I support the idea of a tax credit. It would need to be at a point that it would make some difference.""
In the U.S., between the 1970s and mid-1980s, there were mandates for sprinklers in new construction. But getting sprinklers retrofitted in existing buildings was a taller hurdle, said Robert Solomon, a fire protection engineer with the National Fire Protection Association.
""This fire will bring a window of opportunity for everybody to come together on that,"" Solomon said.
Sprinklers in high-rise buildings became part of the building code in 1981, after deadly fires in Las Vegas, said Rob Neale, vice president for national fire service activities at the International Code Council.
""Any high-rise building that was built prior to that addition of the code, as long as it stayed in that use category, the building code would allow it to stay un-sprinklered,"" Neale said. A number of communities adopted retroactive sprinkler requirements and developed timelines, typically allowing six to eight years for buildings to be retrofitted, he said.
Los Angeles, Houston, San Antonio, San Diego, Chicago and Philadelphia all require sprinklers in existing high-rises regardless of when the buildings were constructed, Neale said.

"Fourth of July fireworks cause 68 horses to crash into fences, stables","July 4 (UPI) -- Dozens of horses in Kentucky were frightened by the sounds of fireworks and crashed into stables and fences as they ran away Monday.
""These horses don't know what fireworks are all about,"" horse owner Wendy Winstead told WAVE. ""I'm as patriotic as anybody else but this has got to stop.""
A total of 68 horses were out to pasture when the fireworks went off Monday night, causing the horses to run in a panic. Many of the animals, including young foals, were injured as they ran into the structures.
""They took off running. I had mares and foals screaming like they were being terrorized,"" Winstead told WDRB.
Winstead, who owns Team Aloha, a horse training and breeding farm in Bagdad, Ky., said that someone could get hurt by frightened horses jumping over fences and onto the street.
""If a horse busts through a fence, gets out on the road, gets hit by a car, that's my liability,"" she said. ""It could kill someone.""
Horsebreeder Kathy Snyder said one of her horses died as a result of Fourth of July fireworks festivities.
The grass was wet. He ran spooked, scared out of his life and broke his hip,"" she said. ""The next morning I had to have him euthanized.""
Horse reactions to fireworks are a common concern for horseowners and many take extra precautions to avoid problems on Independence Day.
""We typically keep our horses in the barn and turn up the radio and fans to help drown out some of the loud noises from fireworks and nearby parties,"" said Jennifer Whittle of TheHorse.com.
Other strategies include keeping horses in the stalls during firework displays or even providing sedatives for particularly anxious horses.",United Press International – US,0
Remind Me Never To Piss Off Sarah Sanders!,"June 23, 2017Natalie D.0 Views 0 Comments# President Trump, ABC Reporter, Jonathan Karl, Mike Huckabee, Sarah Sanders
I don’t remember the media challenging the Obama administration when it really should have been investigated. However, now with Trump’s administration is a whole of a different story. During a press conference, ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl challenged Trump’s Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee-Sanders with questions about former FBI Director James Comey, while suggesting that President Trump is a liar.
Unfortunately for him, Sarah Huckabee is not that kind of a girl who will just stand there and listen to Karl’s attacks! No, she did something that made us all proud of her! She launched an aggressive attack against the leftist journalist saying:
“Hold on Jonathan, I let you finish and read off every single one of those statements. So, unless you want to trade places, I think it’s my turn now.”
Way to go Sarah! She put that ABC reporter in his place…it’s about time someone does!
She then added: “The president is the only person that can fire the director of the FBI. He serves at the pleasure of the president, the president made the decision, it was the right decision. “
“The people that are in the dark today are the Democrats. They want to come out and talk about how they love Comey and how great he was, look at the facts… in Washington we finally had something that I think we should have all been able to agree on, and that was that director Comey shouldn’t have been at the FBI, but the Democrats want to play partisan games.”
You go, Sarah. Awesome response, sharp to the point! She answers with confidence and authority.
President Trump could not have a better speaker. She just shattered him to the ground! He didn’t say anything after the true fact came out.
That disrespectful “journalist” should be barred from the press briefings and ABC put on notice. Instead of asking legitimate questions he has to start a confrontation. This is yet another proof that mainstream media has lost all of its credibility.

Mike Pence Just SHOCKED The Republicans With THIS Viral Rant,"Whom a presidential candidate chooses to be a running mate speaks volumes. When Obama chose Joe Biden as his VP selection, it seemed to confirm what Americans thought about Obama’s judgment. Whenever Biden went before the American public or Congress, his show was one size too big for his mouth.
However, President’s Trump’s judgment in picking someone like Mike Pence was on spot. The US population has gotten to know Pence as a man of integrity, character, and faith. Now they are seeing he is a bulldog as well for the president.
Congress has been playing patty-cake with the whole repeal/replace aspect of Obamacare. Americans know this is a bad healthcare legislation that came from Obama’s liberal support. The Republicans seem hard pressed to get something out before their August recess. Some want to simply repeal then start clean after the break. Others, ok about four, are playing politics with Trump and do not want the current drafts that have come forth.
But V.P. Pence has had it with those of the GOP that are being recalcitrant. This video below shows Pence laying it on the line with the slackers. “Repeal Obamacare” is his warning to them.
The video shows Pence at The National Retail Federation summit in D.C. As he declared to the audience, “Congress needs to do their job, and Congress needs to do their job now!” This main even-keel gentleman is putting the fire to the legislature’s feet to get the Obamacare fiasco handled.
Current GOP Senators dragging their heels and refusing to do anything are Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Jerry Moran of Kansas. These people know that Trump ran on a ticket of getting things done that voters want. But for some reason, they seem to feel that they know better than the constituents.
So Pence is not putting up with it any longer. He knows that things need to get moving and his boss expects it. He isn’t even asking them to come up with a new plan before they leave for the term. Simply do what the voters asked for and repeal Obamacare.
“President Trump and I fully support the majority leader’s decision to move forward with a bill that just repeals Obamacare and gives Congress time, as the president said, to work on a new health care plan that will start with a clean slate,”
But whatever is done, he is adamant they get off their behinds and do their job. Maybe the voters should remember this come 2018 for those seeking re-election then.
Do you feel Pence is right on the money about Congressional inaction?

"Indonesia, Philippines Launch Maritime Border Patrols","Joint patrols come amid a high level of activity in surrounding waters.
This week, Indonesia and the Philippines are conducting the latest iteration of a decades-long annual joint patrol in the Celebes (Sulawesi) Sea. The holding of the patrols illustrates the continuing efforts by both Manila and Jakarta to secure their border areas in the face of rising transnational threats and a high level of activity in the Sulu-Sulawesi Seas.
Though some media outlets mentioned the holding of the Philippines-Indonesia coordinated border patrols, known as CORPAT PHILINDO, within the engagement in the context of newer trilateral patrols between Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines, they have actually been going on since 1986 as part of Manila and Jakarta’s effort to implement their border agreement.
The two navies have been carrying out drills that help them address common challenges in surrounding waters – including smuggling, terrorism, human trafficking, marine protection, and disaster response – as well as test existing doctrines and procedures and enhance interoperability between them (See: “Confronting Threats in the Sulu-Sulawesi Seas: Opportunities and Challenges”).

Last year’s iteration of CORPAT PHILINDO began in Manado City in Sulawesi, Indonesia, and ended in Naval Station Felix Apolinario in Davao City, the Philippines. The Philippines used the Miguel Malvar-class corvette BRP Pangasinan, while Indonesia had the KRI Sura. The engagement also paved the way for the repatriation of Filipino fishermen who had been apprehended in Indonesia’s high seas, a thorny issue that both sides have continued to manage.
This year’s iteration of the patrols will instead formally start on July 6 at the Sasa Wharf in Davao City in the southern Philippines and will end on July 12 in Manado, Indonesia, Ezra Balagtey, a military spokesman with the Eastern Mindanao Command, said in a statement over the weekend. Indonesian military participants arrived on July 4 for the military ceremony organized by the Naval Forces Eastern Mindanao, which took place at Philippine Naval Station Felix Apolinario in Panacan, Davao City.
“[This] is intended to strengthen the security of the Davao Gulf and the common boundary of the two countries in the southern part of the Philippine archipelago particularly along the Celebes Sea and enhance the interoperability of the two countries in maritime patrol,” the statement said.
This year’s drills are occurring amid a high level of activity in the Sulu-Sulawesi Seas. As was referenced earlier, Indonesia and the Philippines, along with Malaysia, just officially launched trilateral patrols in the Sulu Sea a few weeks ago (See: “What’s Next for the New Sulu Sea Trilateral Patrols?”). And a few days ago, the United States and the Philippines carried out a coordinated patrol in the Sulu Sea following an exercise (See: “What’s With the New US-Philippines Sulu-Sea Patrols Under Duterte?”).
Few details were disclosed about this year’s patrols, though they have traditionally consisted of a mix of drills on areas ranging from communications to the replenishment of logistics at sea, medical missions, and other confidence-building measures. Balagtey did say that the patrols would feature a medical mission conducted by military medical personnel aboard the patrolling vessels in a stopover on July 7 at Balut Island, Sarangani, Davao Occidental with the participation of the local government.

Trump Dispels Rumor He Started That There Are Tapes of Comey Talks,"During his tumultuous first few months in office, President Donald Trump has entertained all kinds of “hoaxes,” such as the notion that Russia didn’t interfere in the 2016 election or that climate change is a clever Chinese ruse. Now he can add his own statements to that list.
On Thursday, Trump said that he did not make any recordings of his conversations with former FBI Director James Comey, whom he fired last month. Trump himself raised the possibility that there were “tapes” of those discussions in a tweet last month, but then he backtracked in a series of tweets on Thursday, saying he “did not make” and does not have recordings of his talks with the former FBI chief.
With all of the recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal leaking of information, I have no idea…
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 22, 2017
…whether there are ""tapes"" or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 22, 2017
Trump’s statements could end one of the more intriguing mysteries of his young presidency. If Trump or the White House did have recordings of his talks with Comey, those tapes would be of interest to FBI investigators, who are reportedly examining whether Trump attempted to quash FBI investigation into Trump’s former national security adviser.
According to sworn testimony in Congress by Comey, Trump pushed him to drop the FBI’s investigation of Michael Flynn, who is under investigation for not disclosing income he received from the Russian government, and his lobbying activities on behalf of Turkey.
Trump took to twitter last Month when stories started leaking out about Comey’s relationship with the president.
James Comey better hope that there are no ""tapes"" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017
Testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee this month, Comey said those tapes would vindicate his account of events. “Lordy, I hope there are tapes,” he said.

Tom Hardy to Star in ‘Venom’ Movie,"Home Movies  
 
Sony has announced a star and director for its Spider-Man spin-off, Venom.
Oscar nominated actor, Tom Hardy, for his work in The Revenant, is in final negotiations to star in Venom, while Ruben Fleischer, best known for directing Zombieland, is final negotiations to lead the movie project focusing on one of Spider-Man’s greatest nemesis, Vemon.
The film is one of Sony’s top priorities and the production studio is moving full steam ahead as the movie is anticipated to be released October 5, 2018.
Vemon is set to open up Marvel Universe’s barrage of characters, focusing heavily on Spider-Man based storylines. The reboot of Spider-Man: Homecoming is the first of many movies focusing on the Marvel Universe, releasing this summer. A Silver Sable/Black Cat project is also in the works among other characters revolving around Spider-Man comics.
Since 1988, Venom has been one of Marvel’s top villains and a Spider-Man fixture, created by writer David Michelinie and artists Todd McFarlane and Mike Zeck. Venom’s backstory revolves around an alien symbiote that needs a human host to survive, giving the host incredible powers. Venom made its first appearance on the big screen in Spider-Man 3, starring Toby McGuire, while Vemon’s character was portrayed by Topher Grace.
Scott Rosenberg and Jeff Pinkner, the latter of whom worked on 2014’s The Amazing Spider-Man 2, wrote the script for Venom. While the basis of the story is being kept in dark, we now know that Hardy will play Vemon in the upcoming film.
Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach are producing, along with Amy Pascal.
Fleischer made a name for himself balancing comedy with action and horror elements and recently helmed episodes of the Drew Barrymore cannibal show Santa Clarita Diet and NBC’s Superstore. He is also a producer on Brie Larson’s directorial debut, Unicorn Store.
Hardy has starred in several films including Mad Max: Fury Road and Dark Knight Rises as Bane, a villain who infamously known for breaking Batman’s back in the comics.
With Venom, Hardy transitions from the DC Universe to join the massive comic world of Marvel Universe.
Shortly after news broke, Sony took to Twitter to alert movie-goers and Marvel fans about Hardy’s role in the upcoming film:

The list of Kushner's meetings with Russians,"Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner watch as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and U.S. President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House in Washington, U.S., March 17, 2017.
The list of Kushner’s meetings with Russians keeps getting longer
The story first came to public light in April. The New York Times reported that Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s powerful son-in-law, sought the top-secret security clearance before starting his position in the White House, and at the time, “he was required to disclose all encounters with foreign government officials over the last seven years.”
The article added that failing to disclose foreign contacts can, in some instances, lead to officials losing “access to intelligence, or worse.”
This was relevant because Kushner had failed to disclose a meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and a separate meeting with Sergey Gorkov, the head of a Russian state-owned bank, Vnesheconombank (or VEB). It’s suddenly relevant anew, however, in light of the June 2016 meeting Kushner attended with Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and a Kremlin-linked lawyer. The latest New York Times report noted:
The president learned from his aides about the 2016 meeting at the end of the trip, according to a White House official. But some people in the White House had known for several days that it had occurred, because Mr. Kushner had revised his foreign contact disclosure document to include it.
Much of the focus over the last few days has been on Trump Jr., and for good reason. He reportedly received an email suggesting the Russian government wanted to help elect his father, and Trump Jr. was apparently prepared to collude with Russia to that end.
But have you noticed just how many meetings Kushner attended with Russians, which he initially failed to disclose?
There were the discussions with the Russian ambassador, the meeting with Gorkov, and now the meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya. Kushner has now disclosed each of these meetings, but he was supposed to have already done so. He didn’t.
Is he really that forgetful? Or is it more likely there’s a less benign explanation?

Most expensive race in House history turns out nearly 58 percent of Georgia district's voters,"I’m a political science professor living in Georgia’s Sixth House district, where Republican Karen Handel eked out a victory of nearly four points over Democrat John Ossoff in a special House election on June 20.
And although I have made a career out of observing and teaching others about politics, I’m just relieved the race is over. The word “ubiquitous” doesn’t begin to describe the special election’s presence.
For months, the district has been flooded with every kind of campaign advocacy imaginable: phone calls, mailers, television commercials, lawn signs and ads showing up on every online platform you can think of. Most households have been receiving multiple phone calls every day and multiple home visits from canvassers every week, and everyone has been exposed to more advertising than they can ever remember seeing. I counted 31 pieces of campaign-related mail in just one week. Some residents are even getting campaign texts on their cellphones.
This is because of the astonishing amount of money spent on the race. A typical competitive House race sees a total of about US$5 million spent, and the previous record for the most expensive House race ever was $20 million. During the Georgia Sixth special election, the two candidates together spent about $33 million, and outside groups added about another $27 million on top of that. That nearly $60 million total represents almost $100 for every man, woman and child who lives in the district. It is the most expensive U.S. House race in the country’s history.
What’s interesting is what all this money and activity did and didn’t do.
The effects of advertising

There is very little evidence that the campaigns helped many people decide whom to vote for. At the start of the race in April, just 5 percent of voters were undecided, and the candidates’ numbers barely moved since. The dozen polls taken over the course of the runoff all showed Ossoff and Handel’s support hovering within a few tight percentage points over the entire two months.
Consider the results of the first round of voting. Ossoff easily won that round with 48.1 percent to Handel’s 19.8 percent, but those totals are misleading. More important is that all the Democratic candidates put together received 49 percent of the vote (the four other Democrats on the ballot split less than 1 percent between them) and Republicans received 51 percent (there were 10 on the ballot; four were serious contenders). Those results presaged the tight contest that occurred once the race narrowed to just two contenders.
On the other hand, the massive amount of attention devoted to the race ensured everyone in the district knew about the election, when it would take place, who the candidates were and what party each one represented. This high level of information translated into very high turnout. Normally, turnout in House special elections is about 10 percent. The last time we had one in Georgia was in 2010, when Nathan Deal resigned his House seat to run for governor. That time, 52,000 people voted in the first round, and 40,000 in the second round, out of about 450,000 registered voters.
This time around, 192,000 people voted in the first round, and 259,000 voted in the second round, with roughly the same number of registered voters. That’s an increase in turnout of more than five times the number of voters from 2010 and about 58 percent of registered voters, despite concerns over rain on Election Day.
Little movement on voter preferences and a surge in turnout are what political scientists would expect for a race with exceptionally high spending. Elections research shows that campaigns typically don’t get a lot of people to change their minds about whom to vote for. But they do provide voters with information about the upcoming election, which in turn can drive up turnout.
What’s the big picture?
Another factor that put this race on the map – and the reason so much money was spent on it in the first place – is that many people view it as a proxy for the failure or success of President Donald Trump’s administration. People have strong feelings about Trump, one way or the other, and many of them channeled those feelings into advocacy for Ossoff or Handel.
So what does the race mean for politics going forward?
As a clue about what might happen in 2018, it might not mean as much as some people want to believe. Handel’s close victory might give the Republican Party a morale boost. What’s really important is the broader pattern of how Republican candidates are doing compared to how Trump did in those same districts in 2016.
Democrats have some reason to be optimistic.
In the special election that took place in South Carolina’s Fifth District on the same day as Georgia’s, Republican Ralph Norman received 51.1 percent of the vote in a district where Trump got 57.3 percent just five months earlier.
In April, Kansas Republican Ron Estes received 52.5 percent of the vote in a district where Trump got 60.4 percent.
In May, Montana Republican Greg Gianforte got 49.9 percent where Trump had won 56 percent.
And in a New York state legislative district where Trump won 60 percent of the vote, a Republican candidate polled only 42 percent last month.
On the other hand, the Georgia Sixth District special election bucks that trend. The 10 Republicans collectively beat Trump’s district vote share of 48.3 percent by two points in the first round of voting, and Handel beat it by four points in the runoff.
More immediately, Handel’s victory might give a small boost to Trump’s legislative agenda in Congress. A Democratic victory would have furthered the narrative of Trump’s national unpopularity and convinced some wavering moderate Republicans that they could safely vote against the party on close votes. However, Handel’s victory will probably head that off, allowing Trump and congressional GOP leaders to convince their rank and file to support the party’s program.",The Conversation – Politics,0

Republican and Democrat To Trump On Comey Tapes: Your Tweet Is Not Good Enough,"President Trump’s tweets may be official statements, but two members of the House Intelligence Committee are saying a tweet is not sufficient to dispel the notion the Trump administration may have recordings the conversations between former FBI Director James Comey and President Trump.
Reps. Mike Conaway (R-Texas) and Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said in a joint statement the White House needs to clarify whether it has “recordings, memoranda, or other documents” — adding that they will consider using a “compulsory process” to ensure a satisfactory response.
They want to know whether the White House has — or had — any records, including tapes or written documents, memorializing Trump’s conversations with Comey.
The pair said in their joint statement they have sent the White House a letter asking that it “fully comply” with their request.
“By only referring to the President’s statement, the White House’s letter stops short of clarifying for the Committee whether the White House has any responsive recordings, memoranda, or other documents,” they said.
If this was just Schiff stamping his feet, the Trump administration could blow it off as a partisan, but with Conaway getting involved, it will put more pressure on the White House to hit tomorrow’s deadline.

Chances are, there are no tapes or recordings. It is, however, another example of Trump’s impetuousness making trouble where there doesn’t have to be any.

SitRep: North Korea Wrangling; Hill Wrestles With Russia Sanctions; Debate Over Syria Strategy Continues,"China’s proposal. Officials in Beijing are pushing the Trump administration to begin negotiations on a temporary freeze on North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests “in return for reducing the American military footprint in the Korean Peninsula,” the New York Times’ David Sanger and Gardiner Harris report.
The proposal came up again on Wednesday in Washington, when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis met with their Chinese counterparts.
“But White House officials say they are not interested in any proposal that would require the United States to lift military or economic pressure on the North, even in return for a moratorium on tests. Instead, Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Mattis publicly pressed the Chinese to exert more diplomatic and economic pressure on Pyongyang, though President Trump indicated on Twitter on Tuesday that he had just about given up on obtaining help from the Chinese.”
South Korea’s stance. In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said it is China that needs to do more. Moon called for “strong” sanctions to be slapped on North Korea if it tests an intercontinental ballistic missile or conducts a sixth nuclear test. “China is North Korea’s only ally and China is the country that provides the most economic assistance to North Korea,” Moon said. “Without the assistance of China, sanctions won’t be effective at all.”
FP’s Robbie Gramer and Paul McLeary point out that Beijing is “increasingly caught in the middle of the Trump administration’s showdown with Pyongyang,” since China is North Korea’s economic lifeline, accounting for 90 percent of trade with the Hermit Kingdom, much of it funneled through a shadowy network of front companies and businesses. During a press conference with Mattis on Wednesday, Tillerson said that “we reiterated to China that they have a diplomatic responsibility to exert much greater economic and diplomatic pressure on the regime if they want to prevent further escalation in the region.”
After Raqqa, what? A Trump administration official, speaking with the Washington Post’s Karen DeYoung and Greg Jaffe, dismissed concerns that the U.S. and Iran are lurching toward a deeper conflict in Syria. “If you’re worried that any incident anywhere could cause Iran to take advantage of vulnerable U.S. forces . . . if you don’t think America has real interests that are worth fighting for, then fine,” the official said, adding that with U.S. air power, a small number of forces could act in Syria much like the 1960s TV show, “The Rat Patrol,” about WWII.
The article jumps off from a story in   last week that outlined a debate between the White House and Pentagon about U.S. strategy in Syria, and how strongly U.S. forces should confront Iran there.
ISIS blows up mosque. In Mosul, Islamic State militants bombed the historic Nouri Grand Mosque in Mosul late Wednesday, levelling the structure that has stood for hundreds of years when government forces approached. ISIS is down to a pocket of control in western Mosul, and government forces have them surrounded. The group blamed a U.S. airstrike, but footage clearly shows that the mosque — which had been used to build car bombs — being blown up from the ground.\
Hack back. Russian hackers targeting the 2016 election didn’t just go after email accounts and Democratic Party computers. They also hit American voting systems, and on Wednesday a Department of Homeland Security official offered the government’s first concrete assessment of how many such systems came under attack. Jeanette Manfra, the department’s acting deputy undersecretary of cyber security, told the Senate Intelligence Committee that Russian targeted the “election-related” systems of 21 states. She would not identify which states were targeted and emphasized the department has no evidence Russian hackers were successful in altering votes or vote counts.
Russia sanctions. Senate Democrats are scratching their heads over a move by House Republicans to stall a Senate-passed bill to increase sanctions on Russia. On Tuesday, House lawmakers said they could not move forward on a sanctions bill passed by a 97-2 margin in the Senate because of the constitutional requirement that laws raising revenue originate in the House.
But Senate Democrats don’t know what portion of the bill House lawmakers are objecting to, senior Senate aides said on Thursday. The sanctions bill, which writes Russia sanctions into law and ratchets up other punitive measures on Moscow, is opposed by the White House, which wants the measure watered down and appears to be trying to use Speaker Paul Ryan and his lieutenants to execute an end-run around the Senate.
Afghanistan sinks lower. At least 20 people have been killed and dozens wounded in a car bomb attack on a bank in Lashkar Gah in Helmand province. “This cowardly attack targeted innocent people as they lined up to get their salaries in preparation for the Eid al-Fitr celebrations,” said U.S. Marine Corps Brig. Gen. Roger Turner, commander of Task Force Southwest in a statement. The attack comes as the Taliban surges throughout the country, and the White House and Pentagon continue to hash out details of a strategy for continued U.S. involvement in the country.
Navy blues. Two key Republican lawmakers are set to unveil legislation Thursday that will make it national policy to maintain a 355-ship Navy, according to a draft of the legislation obtained by Defense News.

The U.N. has authorized a new multinational counterterrorism force to talk Islamist militants in West Africa after the U.S. and France resolved their differences over authorization for the troops. The New York Times reports that the U.N.’s new unit will pull 5,000 troops from West African countries but its budget will likely be a source of tension between Washington and Paris and America’s U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley has been looking to cut funding for U.N. peacekeeping operations.
A Russian diplomat will take the helm as the top official at the U.N.’s new Counterterrorism Office, according to Reuters. Vladimir Voronkov, who served as Russia’s Permanent Representative to International Organizations, accepted the position on Wednesday. Western diplomats tell the wire service that while Western countries often disagree with Russia on counterterrorism issues, it’s an area where cooperation is still possible. Russia’s former Ambassador to the U.S. Sergei Kislyak was reportedly in the running for the U.N. job as well.
Conflicts in the Middle East are making preventable diseases disturbingly common, according to the Washington Post, with tens of thousands infected cholera in Yemen and new cases of Polio, a disease that had been nearly eradicated. In Yemen, 1,146 people have died from cholera in recent weeks, after Saudi airstrikes have left the country’s infrastructure severely damaged and led to the closure of medical facilities. The World Health Organization has documented 15 cases of Polio in Syria, including one in the Islamic State’s capital of Raqqa.
The Israeli Air Force’s (IAF) top officer is warning that his service is capable of inflicting much more damage than it was during Israel’s 2006 conflict with Lebanon. The Times of Israel reports that IAF commander Maj. Gen. Amir Eshel told a conference in Israel that his air fleet now has “potential power unimaginable in its scope” and could achieve “in 48-60 hours” what it had previously taken the IAF 34 days to do during the 2006 war. Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah have risen over the past few months with both sides exchanging warnings about a new round of fighting.
The Taliban released a new propaganda video featuring hostages Kevin King and Timothy Weekes, former teachers at the American University of Afghanistan, pleading with their governments to do more to secure their release. King, an American, and Weekes, an Australian, were kidnapped from nearby the university campus in August 2016. The AP reports that both hostages appear healthier than in a previous hostage video release from the Taliban from January 2017.
The U.S. wasted $28 million on uniforms for the Afghan military according to a new report from the Pentagon’s Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR). SIGAR investigators argue that the woodland camo pattern was a poor fit for large swaths of Afghanistan, which is mostly desert terrain. SIGAR also reported that the U.S. opted not to use camouflage patterns it already owned the rights to, opting instead for a new pattern which it had to license from a private company.

Earthquake rocks Greece and Turkey: At least two dead and 120 injured as tremor triggers small tsunami,"Damage caused by a quake in KosCredit:Reuters
21 July 2017 • 6:42am
At least two people have been killed and more than 120 injured after a powerful earthquake shook the Turkish coast and the Greek Islands in an area popular with British tourists.
The quake, which exceeded magnitude 6, struck 6 miles south of Bodrum, in the south west of Turkey, and 10 miles east-northeast of Kos.

The small Greek island appeared to take the brunt of the damage, with two people killed. A small tsunami flooded parts of the tourist strip, and large chunks of rubble covered the streets. A small fishing boat was left washed up on a road.
Wall crushes people at bar
A wall collapsed on a building dating to the 1930s and it crushed people who were at the bar in the building's lower level, according to Kos Mayor Giorgos Kyritsis.
""There are not many old buildings left on Kos. Nearly all the structures on the island have been built under the new codes to withstand earthquakes,"" the mayor said.
The Kos hospital said at least 20 of the injured had broken bones.
Rescuers were checking for trapped people inside houses after the quake struck in the middle of the night. Kyritsis said the army was mobilised along with emergency services.
Authorities had warned of a localised tsunami, and witnesses described a ""swelling"" of the sea after the earthquake. The island's port was among structures that sustained damaged and a seafront road and parts of the island's main town were flooded.
The Greek secretary of state for the merchant navy Nektarios Santorinios, said the injury toll had risen to 120.

As yet there are no indication of British casualties.
""We are speaking to the Turkish and Greek authorities following an earthquake off the coast of Bodrum and near the island of Kos. Any British people in the areas affected should follow the instructions of local authorities,"" a Foreign Office spokesman said.
The temblor, which was initially reported as a magnitude 6.9 and was felt across the Aegean coast, was very shallow, only 6.2 miles below the seabed, the US Geological Survey said. Turkish and Greek authorities put its magnitude lower at 6.3 and 6.4.
In the Turkish city of Marmaris beachfront hotels were flooded. Elsewhere holidaymakers cowered for shelter and in some resorts they abandoned their rooms for safety, gathering in the street.
Two strong aftershocks followed. Hotel guests briefly went back to their rooms to collect their belongings.

But they opted to spend the night in the open air, using sheets and cushions borrowed from nearby lounge chairs to build makeshift beds.
Such was the force of the earthquake its impact was felt as far away as Rhodes and Crete.
""Felt it here (in Rhodes) too. Pretty strong. Looked out the window to see the waves in the pool,"" Daniel Markham, a councillor on Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council in Kent, tweeted.
Tourists tell of chaos
British Tourists turned to social media to describe hotels shaking when the quake struck.
One Twitter user wrote ""Earthquake is Kos, absolute mental, never felt anything like it.""
Kevin McNaughton, a former Premier League footballer who is in Turkey on holiday, wrote: ""Room shaking all over the place. Just stood outside not sure what to do.""

Chris Hackland, a diving instructor on Kos, told Sky News: ""We jumped out of bed and attempted to make it out of the apartment. There were pots and pans being thrown around the kitchen. The light was swinging. It was difficult to walk, it was a scary moment.""
Kristian Stevens, from Nelson in Lancashire, said he felt the building he was in ""shake like a jelly"".
The 48-year-old told the Press Association he had just gone to bed when the quake struck at around 1.30am local time.
He said: ""It was quite surreal as I had just laid down in bed and the whole building shook. The whole building shook like a jelly.

Sophie Wild said she ran from her third floor accommodation when she woke to a loud banging noise.

She said: ""We were asleep and were awoken by what sounded like banging on our door, it got louder and louder and the building started shaking. We jumped up ran to the balcony to see what it was (my first thought when we heard the banging was that we were being attacked).
""When we realised it was an earthquake, we got an immediate sense to get out, we thought the building was going to crumble around us. We ran down our stairs.""
Naomi Ruddock, who is on holiday in Kos with her mother Eleanor, said she felt like she was on a boat in choppy water when the earthquake hit.
The 22-year-old, who is due to graduate from Brighton University next week, said they were woken from their sleep when the room shook.

She said: ""We were asleep and we just felt the room shaking. The room moved. Literally everything was moving. And it kind of felt like you were on a boat and it was swaying really fast from side to side, you felt seasick.""
The pair ran from their ground floor room in the Akti Palace Hotel in Kardamena, around a 30 minute drive from Kos Town which is thought to have been worst hit.
Ms Ruddock, from London, added: ""The restaurant manager just said that he's never seen anything like this ever happen ever around this area or ever in Greece. He said it was like something out of a film, and it was.""
They have been experienced aftershocks every 20 minutes since the earthquake, she said.

The region is prone to quakes, but the impact may have been dampened by the sea. There was also a report of a small tsunami from the European quake agency EMSC .
However Turkish officials said large waves were more likely than a tsunami.
""A small tsunami is confirmed. AVOID BEACHES IN THE AREA, but you are safe on higher grounds,"" EMSC said on Twitter.

Esengul Civelek, the governor of Mugla in n southwestern Turkey, said initial reports showed there were no major damages and disruptions. She said a small number of people had suffered minor injuries.
Mugla Mayor Osman Gurun said power outages affected certain parts of the province and that telephone operators experienced shortages due to overloads. Bodrum Mayor Mehmet Kocadon said the earthquake had caused minor cracks on some old buildings.

The political news cycle is fast, and keeping up can be overwhelming. Trying to find differing perspectives worth your time is even harder. That’s why we have scoured the internet for political writing from the right and left that you might not have seen.

• Guy Benson in Townhall:
“He’s made an excellent, reassuring, conspiracy-puncturing decision here, and that matters. Or at least it should.”
After President Trump fired James B. Comey as the F.B.I. director, Mr. Benson wrote that he would reserve judgment until he saw whom Mr. Trump would nominate as a replacement. Now that Christopher A. Wray, the president’s pick, has testified before the Senate (and received rave reviews from political leaders on both sides of the aisle), Mr. Benson is confident that the fallout from Mr. Comey’s ouster is not as dire as initially predicted.

“However you might feel about a given Trump scandal, ask yourself how you’d feel if it was President Hillary Clinton facing the same challenge.”

Mr. Last urges some Republican self-reflection when he asks his readers to “imagine we’re on an alternate planet where Hillary Clinton won the election and the parties and players are flipped.” He uses this thought experiment to condemn tribalism, which he sees as the “number one disease” afflicting American political culture.

• A. Barton Hinkle in Richmond Times-Dispatch:
“For years, environmentalists have blasted ‘climate science deniers’ for refusing to accept the evidence for human-caused global warming. Is it time we started talking about economic-science deniers, too?”
Mr. Hinkle, who compares the debate over the minimum wage to that of climate change, argues that liberals who reject “economic science” are no better than climate-change deniers. He extends the metaphor, writing, “Different goods and services have different price elasticities, just as different greenhouse gases have different radiative forcing effects.” This does not mean that “just because a small increase has no effect, a big increase will have none, either.” Read more »
• Jackie Gingrich Cushman in Townhall:
“While you might still argue for a more liberal or less liberal immigration policy, you would do well to base that argument on some of these key facts.”
Before one reaches a conclusion about immigration to the United States, Ms. Cushman writes, one must establish a frame of reference based on a few comparative statistics. Using immigration data from around the world, she concludes that “when comparing with other high-population countries, the United States is the world’s most welcoming.” Read more »

“Mitch McConnell is trying to make liars out of Republican opponents of his odious health care bill.”
Mr. Beutler critiques the latest attempt by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to pass a health care bill. The cynicism, he writes, is “breathtaking”: “The proposition is that the most vulnerable citizens should take a flyer on the hope that the least honest governing party in memory will take another vote at some point in the future to spare them.” Read more »

• Charles P. Pierce in Esquire:
“Not Being Corrupt is setting the bar for an FBI director somewhere deep in the planet’s mantle, but these folks will take anything they can get.”
Like Mr. Benson, Mr. Pierce sees a bipartisan consensus arising from Mr. Wray’s confirmation hearing. For Mr. Pierce, however, the consensus is rooted in a cross-party thirst for a return to normalcy. Republicans, he notes, should feel responsible for this disturbance in the political equilibrium.

• Katha Pollitt in The Nation:
“Only women’s rights to contraception and abortion are perpetually debatable, postponable, side-trackable.”
Democratic candidates cannot treat women who support abortion rights as an inessential constituency, Ms. Pollitt argues. While an anti-abortion candidate could potentially garner Democrats a few Republican votes in tough swing elections, the cynical political calculation is not worth it. “Imagine,” she writes, “if Democrats, sick and tired of losing white votes in Mississippi, decided to nominate a segregationist for governor.” Read more »

“The increasing power of Silicon Valley tech billionaires means the increasing influence of a political philosophy that would be catastrophic for ordinary people.”
Ms. Tveten and Mr. Blest warn against embracing a new class of technologists as the solution to our political problems.

Court rules civil service redundancy payment cuts unlawful,"Decision on changes to compensation scheme ruling likely to leave government open to legal challenges from public sector workers

Decision on changes to compensation scheme ruling likely to leave government open to legal challenges from public sector workers
Tuesday 18 July 2017 06.59 EDTLast modified on Tuesday 18 July 2017 07.29 EDT
A controversial cut to redundancy payments for civil servants has been successfully challenged in the high court, leaving the government open to hundreds of claims for compensation.
The civil service compensation scheme was slashed by ministers in November, reducing redundancy pay and early access to pensions for thousands of public sector workers.
At least 750 Whitehall policy experts to relocate to Brexit departments
But a judicial review of the changes ruled on Tuesday that the cuts were unlawful because the Cabinet Office failed to consult with a trade union.
The ruling is expected to leave the government open to legal challenges from hundreds of public sector workers who have accepted the reduced terms. It is a blow for Theresa May’s government, which has been under fire for refusing to lift the public sector pay cap.
The public sector union PCS, which has more than 160,000 civil service members, was unhappy with the new scheme and mounted the judicial review in February following advice that the CSCS changes were unlawful. It was heard in the high court on 4 and 5 July 2017 by Lord Justice Sales and Mrs Justice Whipple.
“We feel this ruling is very clear,” said a PCS union spokesman. “We would like this scheme to be quashed.”
He added: “Whether the government wants to begin consultation again is a matter for them.”
The union claimed that there had been a failure to consult with employees’ representatives; unlawful interference with “possessions”; and a failure to comply with the public sector equality duty.
Counsel for the Cabinet Office claimed the outcome would not have been affected if the union had been allowed to participate.
The main changes of the imposed terms were to cut the tariff for calculating payments from one month’s salary for every year of service to three weeks; cut the cap for voluntary redundancy and voluntary exit from 21 months’ salary to 18 months; and cut the cap for compulsory redundancy from 12 months’ salary to nine months.
It meant that a civil servant with 30 years’ service and paid £30,000 per annum would have been entitled to a redundancy payment of £52,500, but after the change would receive £45,000 - a 14% reduction.
A civil servant with 20 years’ service and paid £15,000 a year would have been entitled to £38,333 in redundancy, but after the imposed change would receive £28,161 – a 27% reduction.
The coalition government first attempted to implement the changes in 2010 and issued fresh consultations last year.
In June 2016, the Cabinet Office wrote to the unions proposing further talks but stating: “Those unions engaging in the talks have accepted that the proposal above will form the basis of a reformed, negotiated, set of arrangements that their relevant executives can recommend acceptance to their members in any ballot.”
The CPS, Unite and the Prison Officers’ Association refused to get involved in the talks, leading to the judicial review.
A cabinet office spokesperson said: “The government is carefully considering the judgment and intends to appeal.”",The Guardian – Politics,0
How Russia's New Husky-Class Submarines Borrow from the U.S. Navy's Playbook,"The Russian Navy is taking a page out of the United States Navy’s playbook as it develops its family of next generation nuclear submarines.
Tentatively called Project Husky, the new submarines will be built in three variants—a basic attack submarine model, an expanded guided-missile submarine (SSGN) version and an enlarged ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) variant writes Ilya Kramnik, a defense reporter with Lenta.ru. The new vessels are expected to start construction in the 2020-2021 timeframe.
The Russians are trying to ensure that all three versions of the Husky retain the maximum amount of commonality. In many respects, the new submarines are similar in concept to the U.S. Navy’s Virginia-class SSNs that were developed after the end of the Cold War when the extremely potent Seawolf-class boats proved to be far too expensive.
The Virginia-class started off as a basic SSN design, but has evolved into an SSGN with the addition of the Virginia Payload Module (VPM) in future boats of the class. Moreover, in many ways, the U.S. Navy’s forthcoming Columbia-class SSBNs are also a direct evolution of the Virginia-class design—leveraging most of the older SSN design’s technology and systems onboard a larger hull.
The Husky will follow a similar path as the Virginia-class design, Kramnik notes.
The Russians expect to start off with a basic SSN design that would displace between 8,000 and 9,000 tons and have speed of between 32 to 33 knots. The vessel would be armed with torpedoes and sea-mines, but could launch cruise missiles via its torpedo tubes. The Russians also want the vessel to be able to deliver and recover special operations forces and their gear—just like the Virginia-class.
The SSGN version and the SSBN variant would be built by stretching the submarine by adding an extra hull section—similar to how the VPM adds four payload tubes each capable of launching seven cruise missiles from a Multiple all-up-round Canister (MAC) by means of a hull plug. The Russians, too, are looking at developing a MAC canister that would rapidly enable the SSBN version to switch their payloads over to carrying cruise missiles in packs of five to seven weapons per tube. That’s similar in concept to America’s four Ohio-class SSGNs that were originally armed with Trident II submarine launched ballistic missiles.
Presumably, the Husky SSBN variant would be scaled-up from the SSN and SSGN versions in a manner similar to how the Columbia-class is essentially a larger derivative of the Virginia in terms of its sensors and most of its machinery. Indeed, Kramnik states that all of the Husky-class variants would have the same sensors and propulsion systems—including the same life-of-the boat pressurized water reactor—all of which are advanced derivatives of systems onboard the Project 995A Borei-class SSBN and Project 885M Yasen-class SSGNs.
The Russians hope that the Husky will be significantly more affordable than the Project 885M SSGNs, which are excellent submarines, but are extremely expensive. Indeed, given the economies of scale in terms of common parts and systems, the Russians hope to bring the cost of the Husky down to a level where they can build a minimum of 16 to 20 of the attack and SSGN versions of the boat—and possibly more. The Russians would ideally like to be able to order one new boat every two years with deliveries taking no more than four and a half years from the start of construction. If all goes as planned, the first Husky would be delivered in 2025 while the last would be delivered in the 2030s.
The SSBN version would be built after the last of the Project 995A Borei-class ballistic missile submarines are delivered. According to Kramnik, the next generation boomer would help Russia to continue upgrading its nuclear forces in the 2020s if Moscow can’t reach further nuclear arms control agreements with the United States.
However, U.S. analysts such as Center for Naval Analyses researcher Michael Kofman are somewhat puzzled by the Russians’ desire to build another SSBN class.
“It's unclear why they need a new SSBN,” Kofman told The  .
“I think an SSN is really a stronger priority.”
If the Russians realize their vision for the Husky, the new boat should provide Moscow with a design the Kremlin can build in large quantities and replace the Soviet-era vessels that still comprise the bulk of their fleet. But even with the addition of the advanced Husky-class, the Russian undersea force—though armed with potent new vessels—will not be the menace that the massive Soviet fleet once was.

Exclusive: BT make move to take The Masters from Sky,"Sky have hosted The Masters since 2011Credit:getty images
25 July 2017 • 7:37pm
Sky’s grip on major golf could be weakened yet further as The   has discovered that BT is in talks with Augusta as it tries to wrest full coverage of the Masters.
The BBC is due to confirm that it has secured the live rights for next month’s US PGA Championship, after the PGA of America’s contract with Sky ended and negotiations for a renewal broke down.
Yet while that is an embarrassment to Sky, particularly after it launched its dedicated golf channel two weeks ago, if BT did convince the Augusta green jackets to switch allegiance that would represent a much more foreboding scenario.
Sky has been the UK’s host channel for the Masters since 2011, in a shared agreement which allows the BBC to show the final two rounds live. The contract is believed to already be up and talks between Sky and Augusta are apparently in an impasse because of finances. BT sees this as the ideal avenue to enter golf, but there are nervous faces not only at Sky but also the European Tour.
Without Sky’s backing the Tour would not operate its present guise, if at all, and the last thing the powers that be at Wentworth HQ would want is for Murdoch Towers to become disillusioned with the sport and walk away.
Sky showed live coverage of last week's Open ChampionshipCredit:mark robinson
Yet any sense of ingratitude on Sky’s behalf would be totally understandable, especially with rumours circulating that the USGA, which runs the US Open, is ready to look elsewhere in the quest for bigger viewing figures when its deal runs out in 2018.
Sky has been a brilliant and loyal broadcaster of golf, showing blanket coverage of the European Tour and PGA Tour, and has stuck with the sport despite the falling participation levels and the concern about the professional game after the downfall of Tiger Woods.
After screening the US PGA since 1992, it will, of course, be disappointed not to show Jordan Spieth’s shot at history in Charlotte in two weeks’ time, as the Texan, who turns 24 on Thursday, attempts to replace Tiger Woods as the youngest player to complete the career grand slam.
The five golfers to have won a career grand slam - and the 12 three-major winners, including Jordan Spieth
Spieth’s extraordinary win in the Open at Royal Birkdale on Sunday has sent the game into fever pitch. Many are expecting Rory McIlroy to respond to Spieth’s new standing on a Quail Hollow course where he has won twice, which only adds to the intrigue at the year’s final major.
The BBC is certain to attain the UK’s biggest viewing figures of the 2017 majors and it will be interesting to see if the PGA of America is influenced by the audience when deciding on future coverage.
Matt Kuchar will obviously be a popular pick at Quail Hollow after running Spieth so close on the Southport links. The 39-year-old jumps straight back on to the horse by playing in this week’s Canadian Open in an Ontario field also including world No 1 Dustin Johnson and England’s Ian Poulter.

US asks countries in East and South China Sea to exercise restraint,"The Pentagon has asked countries in East and South China Sea to exercise restraint and avoid indulging in provocative behaviour. (Reuters)
The Pentagon has asked countries in East and South China Sea to exercise restraint and avoid indulging in provocative behaviour. “We would continue to urge everybody in that area, in the South China Sea and the East China Sea, to exercise restraint and not do things that are provocative and to respect each other’s sovereignty in their operations,” Pentagon Spokesman Navy Capt Jeff Davis told reporters during an off-camera news conference. Davis was responding to questions on Chinese H-6 bombers flying over the Bashi Channel and the Miyako Strait several times over the past week. The Chinese Defense Ministry has told Japan that it should get used to it. “China’s air force over the past week conducted multiple drills far out at sea, with H-6K bombers and many other types of aircraft flying through the Bashi Channel and Miyako Strait, testing actual battle capabilities over the sea,” Chinese Air Force spokesman Shen Jinke was quoted as saying by the state-run CGTN website. Japan scrambled fighters in response, the Japanese media reported.
“It is legitimate for Chinese military planes to fly through the strait, and more similar training will be conducted on the high seas as needed,” China Defense Department spokesman Ren Guoqiang Guoqiang said. “The parties concerned don’t need to overact and make a great fuss about it. They will feel better after getting used to such drills,” he said. However, China protested when a US Air Force Bomber flew over South China Sea ahead of the meeting between the US President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, on the sidelines of the G-20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany.",Financial Express,0

"ILLEGAL ALIEN Deported 7 Times Commits MURDER, Libs Threaten To RIOT Unless He Is Freed","(Nemias Garcia-Velasco arrested in the deadly Nebraska crash. (Omaha Police Department))
Dean James III% AMERICA’S FREEDOM FIGHTERS –
An illegal alien who sneaked into the United States from Mexico seven times was driving drunk and speeding down a Nebraska highway when he crashed his van last week, killing a passenger sitting in the back of the vehicle, Fox News reported.
Douglas County prosecutors said in court Tuesday Nemias Garcia-Velasco, 32, was deported in 2009 and 2011 and “voluntarily returned” to Mexico five times in 2005, the Omaha World-Herald reported. He was convicted of making a false claim to U.S. citizenship in 2005.
Garcia-Velasco’s bail was set at $2 million. Prosecutor Ryan Lindberg in court on Tuesday requested a high bail for the illegal immigrant because he feared the man might flee the country — again.
“If this is someone who bonds out, I don’t think we’ll see Mr. Garcia-Velasco again,” Lindberg said.
Garcia-Velasco was speeding down an interstate in Omaha about 1 p.m. last Wednesday when he lost control of his 2001 Dodge Ram van, slamming into a guard rail before the vehicle rolled over and caught fire, officials said.
Silvano Torres, 58, who wasn’t wearing a seat belt while riding in the back of the van, died in the crash. Torres’ girlfriend told the newspaper her boyfriend had documents to be in the U.S. and he was a father to two girls and a boy.
Another passenger, Jesus I. Gonzalez, 16, was hospitalized and released later that day.
Garcia-Velasco later told police he drank 12 beers the night before and into the morning of the crash. His blood-alcohol level was at .243, three times the legal limit of .08, according to the Omaha World-Herald.
Garcia-Velasco was treated for severe burns, released and booked into jail. He was charged with motor vehicle homicide, driving under the influence and operating without a driver’s license, KETV reported. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.

"35,000 mink released from farm in Minnesota, unable to survive in wild, officials say","Minks are found near water and are covered in oil to repel water. (July 18, 2017)
Minks are found near water and are covered in oil to repel water. (July 18, 2017)
Authorities say 35,000 mink that were set free from a pelt farm in central Minnesota are incapable of surviving in the wild.
The Stearns County Sheriff's Office says someone entered the property of Lang Farms in Eden Valley late Sunday or early Monday, dismantled parts of the exterior fence and then released about 35,000 mink from their cages. Eden Valley is about 75 miles northwest of Minneapolis.
Authorities say the mink are raised for their pelts and won't survive in the wild. The animals are worth more than $750,000.
The Sheriff's Office warns that people who come into contact with any of the mink should report the sighting but not try to capture them because they can bite.

Danes Tout Family Planning Aid to Africa to ‘Limit Migration’ to Europe,"Denmark, like plenty of other countries, is stepping up to fill in the funding gap in global family planning as the United States backs away from such endeavors. But the Danes let slip that their motivations may not be entirely altruistic.
Speaking at a family planning summit in London on Tuesday, Danish Minister for Development Cooperation Ulla Tørnæs justified a 91-million kroner ($15 million) commitment to underwriting contraceptives in Africa.
“To limit the migration pressure on Europe, a part of the solution is to reduce the very high population growth in many African countries.” Tørnæs in a press release regarding the event. Tørnæs additionally stated that curtailing African population growth is important for Danish foreign and security policy.
Denmark, a small, homogenous country generally recognized for its social democratic values and strong welfare state, has like other European countries seen immigration become a central political issue. The far-right, nativist Danish People’s Party has grown rapidly in recent years, becoming the second-largest political party during the 2015 elections. It’s now a needed source of support for traditional political formations, like Tørnæs’ conservative-liberal party, Venstre.
Anti-immigrant and asylum-seeker sentiment has grown across the political spectrum — just as the number of asylum seekers has spiked in the tiny country. The number of asylum seekers increased from 14,792 in 2014 to 21,316 in 2015 according to statistics from the Danish Ministry of Immigration, Integration and Housing, out of a total population of 5.7 million.
In late June, the Social Democrats, Denmark’s most traditionally liberal party, proposed that migrants and refugees coming to Europe should be sent back to EU-run camps in Africa to wait and apply for asylum. The Social Democrats at the time cited ethical concerns of preventing these immigrants from living as poor laborers within Europe. Social Democrat spokesperson on European matters Peter Hummelgaard cited African population growth, as well as climate change, as reasons why mass migration will continue.
Denmark has been a consistent partner on family planning, and Tørnæs herself has championed this issue. The Danish government has easily surpassed its pledge of $13 million for family planning by 2020 made at the 2012 Family Planning Summit. Tørnæs was applauded at the Tuesday conference after stating that Denmark will next year celebrate 40 years of meeting the UN goal of dedicating 0.7 percent of GNI to international aid.
To be sure, Tørnæs stressed the traditional arguments for support for family planning at the summit, emphasizing a “developmental perspective” and economic results of family planning with a humanitarian concern for the rights of women and girls over their own bodies, underscoring the growing population of refugees and displaced peoples.
And Danes aren’t the only ones to have stepped into the minefield of African family planning lately. Newly-elected French president Emmanuel Macron last week at the G-20 summit in Germany railed against what he called Africa’s “civilizational problems,” including families with “seven to eight children per woman.” That drew a hearty rebuke from Africa specialists, who noted that the French colonial legacy — continued today by the Catholic Church — frowned on contraceptives, exacerbating birth rates and scourges like HIV/AIDS across the continent.
In Washington, the old refrain goes, a gaffe is when a politician accidentally tells the truth. While Denmark’s willingness to underwrite family planning has never been in doubt, the unprecedented influx of migrants — and Tørnæs’ frank admission about the national-security motivations behind such efforts — may make clear just what’s behind some of Europe’s apparent good will.
“I’m in the situation that I have got an increased budget line due to reduction in refugee costs back home, and I envisage that I will spend quite a lot of this on issues related to family planning….so you can count on Denmark and our support for this agenda,” Tørnæs said.",Foreign Policy,0
University of Manitoba study urges caution in use of artificial sweeteners,"WINNIPEG — A University of Manitoba study suggests artificial sweeteners are linked to the risk of long-term weight gain, heart disease and other health issues.
The study, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, says more people are eating and drinking artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose and stevia.
The university found new data indicating artificial sweeteners may have a negative effects on metabolism, gut bacteria and appetite.
Author Ryan Zarychanski says despite the fact that millions of individuals routinely consume artificial sweeteners, relatively few patients have been included in clinical trials of the products.
The research reviewed 37 studies that followed more than 400.000 people for an average of 10 years.
Until the long-term effects of artificial sweeteners are proven, the study recommends people be cautious about how much they are eating and drinking.",National Post,0
Florida Sheriff Encourages Constituents to Get Guns!,"If you don’t want to be a ‘sitting duck’ get a gun! That’s right!
Any criminal who is armed and dangerous and threatens your life in your home doesn’t plan on you fighting back. Sheriff Judd of Polk County says you are a ‘sitting duck’. If you want to avoid that situation, then get a gun and be ready to shoot back.
Even in a group as tough as the sheriffs of Florida, Grady Judd stands out.
The tough-talking top lawman of Polk County, in the first year of his fourth term in office, has made a national name for himself with his no-nonsense comments on illegal aliens, his deputies fatally shooting a suspected cop-killer, and other topics.
But Judd’s latest advice to the citizens he’s sworn to protect is one for the ages.
“If you’re not afraid of a gun, get one,” Judd told WTVT, a Fox-owned television station in Tampa.
In a late June interview with the station about so-called “active shooter” situations like the one at the Pulse nightclub last June in Orlando, when an Islamic terrorist murdered 49 patrons of a gay dance club.
“An armed assailant doesn’t plan on you fighting back,” Judd said. “He plans on having a gun. Doing all shooting. And you’re just a sitting duck.”
The only way to avoid that situation, Judd said, is to arm yourself beforehand.
“Well, the ducks need to shoot back,” he said.
Check it out here:
As the TV news story made clear isn’t the only Sunshine State sheriff who looks at it that way.
In early June Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey created an internet sensation when his office posted a video of the sheriff explaining the cold facts of life – and death – when it comes to law-abiding citizens being armed.
“No matter who you are or what your position is on guns, there’s no denying the fact that the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun or a knife, is an armed and well-prepared citizen or law enforcement officer,” Ivey said.
Not to be outdone, another central Florida sheriff, Michael Chitwood of Volusia County, told WTVT he agrees with Judd and Ivey completely.
“There’s not enough police in America to stop all of these threats,” Chitwood told the station.
Florida Sheriff Grady Judd once said,
If you are foolish enough to break into someone’s home, you can expect to be shot in Polk County, it’s more important to have a gun in your hand than a cop on the phone. Such full-throated embrace of the Second Amendment as a crime-fighting tool isn’t confined to red states like Florida. I want as many law-abiding citizens to arm themselves in Polk County as we can get.
After beginning his career with the Polk County Sheriff’s Office in 1972 as a dispatcher, Grady Judd quickly progressed through every rank – from Corporal to Colonel. As a small child growing up in Polk County, Grady had dreamed of being Sheriff. In 2004, Polk County overwhelmingly elected Grady to serve as their Sheriff, fulfilling that childhood dream.
Citizens in Polk County can be thankful for Grady Judd, a sheriff who strongly supports the 2nd Amendment – the right for every citizen to bear arms.",Ihavethetruth,1
"Bal Gangadhar Tilak great grandson, Congress leader Rohit Tilak booked for rape: Police","Congress leader Rohit Tilak, who is the great-grandson of Bal Gangadhar Tilak, has been booked for allegedly raping a woman and forcing her into “unnatural” sex, the police said.

Congressman Stuns the Internet by Asking NASA if Aliens Lived on Mars Thousands of Years Ago [VIDEO],"A US Congressman issued a head-scratching question to NASA in a hearing with the US House Committee on the future of Science, Space and Technology. The bizarre question was focused on whether aliens existed on Mars thousands of years ago. As you might imagine, the internet was in a frenzy with many wondering, “Was he for real?”
[Scroll Down For Video]
California Republican Dana Rohrabacher interrupted the hearing as he asked Ken Farley, the project scientist for NASA’s Mars 2020 rover mission, if there was an ancient alien civilization on Mars “thousands of years ago?”
He interjected before Farley could answer by adding, “would you rule that out?” The left field question led to a moment of silence from those in the room. Farley, who was visibly taken aback by the question, simply replied that it was “extremely unlikely.”
Rohrabacher, who wasn’t taking “unlikely” as an answer, continued, “You have indicated that Mars had a, was totally different thousands of years ago.” To which Farley replied, “The evidence is that Mars was different billions of years ago, not thousands of years ago.”
Commenters on the internet had an absolute field day with the bizarre exchange that has since gone viral.
One Twitter user, mocked the Congressman by stating: “Is the moon really cheese? #StupidQuestionsForAstronauts”
Popular Twitter account Earth Sky Science, which has over 800,000 followers, was truly baffled by the question after asking, “Was he for real?”
Another science advocate, Brian Kahn, a senior climate writer, took to Twitter to make light of the exchange. “That moment when you’re not sure if the ancient Martian civilization question is a joke or if your agency’s funding depends on your answer,” he wrote.
Some internet users came to the defense of the Congressman. One Reddit user wrote: “Normal people have no idea or even think about any civilization outside of Earth and they don’t get to ask questions like this, so this man just cleared that up for the world.”
Recently, Mars came into the media spotlight after a guest appeared on Alex Jones’ InfoWars and claimed NASA was sending children to become slaves of a secret colony. Obviously, NASA refuted the guest’s statement from that show.
Rohrabacher may just be an avid watcher of History Channel’s Ancient Aliens. But the Congressman should probably realize that if you do or say something stupid, the internet commenters are going to call you on it.

CNN Shareholders Demand the Network Quit Spreading Fake News!,"CNN and its CEO Jeff Bewkes came under fire last week during a Time Warner shareholders’ meeting for the network’s overt bias and fake news against President Donald Trump.
The CNN shareholders’ meeting occurred one day after a gunman opened fire on GOP lawmakers at an Alexandria, Va., baseball field.
David Almasi is a shareholder of CNN’s parent company, Time Warner. He is also vice president for the National Center for Public Policy Research. Almasi said he felt compelled as a shareholder to take TW executives to task for “CNN’s contribution to the increasingly uncivil environment in Washington.”
“Mr. Bewkes, we have urged you many times to make CNN more objective,” Almasi told the CNN chief. “But bias is apparently worse than ever. As shareholders, we are concerned about the reputational risk to our investment. Time Warner, as CNN, appears to be a key player in the war against the Trump presidency.”
“Are you concerned about advertisers leaving CNN?” Almasi asked. “Will you continue to ignore appeals for objectivity at the risk to our investment in Time Warner?”
Bewkes tried to defend CNN against the accusations of fake news, but did “recommit” to “an attempt to be independent.”
“We will recommit. I’ll do it to you now. We will make an attempt to try to be independent,” the CNN chief said in response to Almasi’s questions. “I do understand from your questions that you’re skeptical that we’re achieving that. You think we haven’t.”
“I don’t want you to be skeptical of our effort. We’re very sincere to try to achieve that. That’s what we are trying to do,” he continued. “The decision on whether we’ve failed — you’re right — will be made by the viewer.”
“But we are trying to keep it balanced and fair. I understand that you’re thinking that we haven’t succeeded, but we are still trying,” Bewkes added.
Almasi believes it’s important for the news media to promote “vigorous debate that looks at all sides.” So he took deliberate issue with CNN trying to claim that they are “balanced and fair.”
He cited a May study by the Media Research Center, which found that CNN devoted nearly every minute of its programming on May 12 to covering the Trump administration in a negative light:
CNN claims it’s right down the middle, somewhere between the left-wing MSNBC and the more conservative-friendly Fox News Channel. But an MRC study of an entire day of CNN’s coverage shows the network spent almost all of its time covering the Trump presidency, with a heavily skewed roster of anti-Trump guests and on-air commentators.
To get a handle on CNN’s news priorities during the Trump era, a team of MRC analysts reviewed all of the cable network’s programming on Friday, May 12, starting with the 4am ET Early Start and continuing through the 11pm ET CNN Tonight with Don Lemon, a total of 20 hours of material.
After excluding commercials, teases and promos, our analysts found 13 hours, 27 minutes of actual news coverage, an average of just over 40 minutes per hour. Of that, a whopping 92 percent (12 hours, 19 minutes) was devoted to the Trump presidency, with a mere 68 minutes — a little more than three minutes per hour — devoted to all of the other news of the day.
With the exception of about 21 minutes of live coverage of a White House briefing about the President’s upcoming trip to the Middle East and a smattering of coverage of Melissa McCarthy’s parody of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer in an upcoming SNL appearance, CNN used that time to endlessly analyze the President’s firing of FBI Director James Comey, then a three-day-old story.
So with Bawkes promising to “recommit” to “an attempt to be independent” will we see changes in the future? I guess we will have to wait and see.",Ihavethetruth,1

"Rideshare will help decongest Delhi roads,curb pollution: Uber","Uber has also launched a nationwide campaign ‘Decongest India’ to promote the concept of shared mobility and how it can ease the stress on urban transportation. (Image Source: Reuters)
Cab aggregator Uber today said shared mobility can help de-congest roads in the city of Delhi which has over one crore registered vehicles. The US-based firm has also launched a nationwide campaign ‘Decongest India’ to promote the concept of shared mobility and how it can ease the stress on urban transportation. Uber Head of Public Policy (India and South Asia) Shweta Rajpal Kohli said it is important that private car ridesharing becomes mainstream as private car remains unutilised for 96 per cent of its time and average occupancy rates is around 1.14 people per car.
The average time spent on Delhi roads has doubled over the last six years as the speed of traffic has gone down by half, she added. According to reports, the traffic speeds in Delhi could come down to 5 km per hour in the next 10 years — which is the average speed of walking — unless immediate measures are taken.Another report by IIT Madras says the cost of congestion on Delhi’s roads amounts to about Rs 60,000 crore per year, which includes cost of loss of productivity, road accidents and fuel wastage. This number is likely to go up to Rs 98,000 crore by 2030.

“With the launch of Decongest India, we are hoping to draw the attention of policymakers on how cars can be part of the solution – rather than the problem,” Kohli said. Asked about the rapid growth in number of commercial vehicles on Delhi streets, she said, “these account for less than one per cent of the total registered cars”. The government is looking into whether private cars can be used for ride-sharing to curb increasing traffic congestion across major cities in the country.
To formulate rules around ride-sharing, the government will have to study various aspects, including safety, regulations and taxation-related implications. Uber, which offers shared rides on commercial vehicles through UberPOOL, said its shared mobility solutions have helped save millions of kms travelled and fuel usage. “More than 30 per cent of our total trips in Delhi are POOL trips… The City has our third largest base of POOL users globally,” Prabhjeet Singh, General Manager at Uber India (Delhi and North India) said.",Financial Express,0
PUTIN MEETS MOON: Russia calls for calm and rational approach to Korean issues,"Adam Garrie11 hours agoJuly 8, 2017 99
Vladimir Putin has recently spoken with the leaders of China, Japan and South Korea over the issue.
Vladimir Putin’s marathon of meetings with world leaders continues as he sat down with South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in. Moon is generally considered a far more peace minded South Korean leader than his disgraced and subsequently impeached predecessor Park Geun-hye.
Speaking beside Moon, Putin said,
“The North Korean nuclear program is a very acute problem, but we must act carefully and pragmatically, and we must keep cool heads”.
Moon praised Russia’s ability to work for peace in Korea and accepted Putin’s invitation to the forthcoming Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok. Moon also said that he looks forward to welcoming Putin and representatives of Russia to South Korea as soon is such a visit can be arranged.
Moon later stated that he is in favour of a diplomatic solution for peace between the two Korean states saying,
“The current situation where there is no contact between the relevant authorities of the South and the North is highly dangerous. I am ready to meet with Chairman Kim Jong Un of North Korea at any time at any place, if the conditions are met and if it will provide an opportunity to transform the tension and confrontation on the Korean Peninsula”.
Moon also met with Chinese President Xi Jinping where the South Korean President signalled that he retains hope in China’s international leadership on the North Korean issue.
Thus far, the biggest obstacle to peace on the Korean peninsula is America’s refusal to halt deliveries of THAAD missile systems to South Korea. Halting deliveries of THAAD is a key condition in the joint Chinese-Russian peace plan which would also requires North Korea to pause its nuclear programme.
Putin earlier spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe about a range of issues including Korea. Putin was delayed in his meeting with Abe due to the meeting with Donald Trump running so long. Putin offered a public apology to the Japanese Prime Minister on behalf of both Russia and the United States for the delay. It was widely applauded as a deeply gentlemanly move from the Russian President.",The Duran,1
Dem Mayor Of Seattle Now Refusing To Resign As Foster Home Scandal Ruins Him,"Posted by Luis Orozco | Jul 18, 2017 | Breaking News
After the terrible allegations suggesting he sexually abused four men as teenagers, Murray said in May that wouldn’t seek re-election. However, he pledged to serve out his term through the end of this year.
After experiencing the worst kind of controversy that a public figure could face, Democratic Seattle Mayor Ed Murray assured he’s not going to resign since he believes this step would create a destabilizing transition that would probably bring city business to a halt.
After the terrible allegations suggesting he sexually abused four men as teenagers, Murray said in May that he wouldn’t seek re-election. However, he pledged to serve out his term through the end of this year.
Nevertheless, Murray’s pressure to step down escalated to a whole new level after the Seattle Times reported that an Oregon child-welfare investigator determined that he had sexually abused his foster son Jeff Simpson 30 years ago.
Seattle Mayor Ed Murray’s reputation has been destroyed by the sex scandal.
The Mayor’s former foster son is actually one of the men who publicly accused him of sexual abuse, adding an even more destructive element to an unspeakable accusation. Regarding this horrible issue, Murray said the child-welfare investigator didn’t interview him at the time. Additionally, Murray said the allegations were fully investigated and prosecutors never brought any charge.
Another reason why Murray’s unwillingness to resign is quite controversial is because former Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn and fellow mayoral candidates as Nikkita Oliver, Cary Moon, or Jessyn Farrell called for him to step down.
Moon started this request on May 9, through a statement where he said that Murray had to step down so that City Hall can get back to work. Additionally, he said that it’s in the best interests of the many survivors of sexual attack re-experiencing their own traumas that the Mayor resigns.
The first details about Simpson’s claims were revealed back in April when a Kent man called Delvonn Heckard filed a lawsuit against the Mayor, saying that he sexually assaulted him in the 1980s in Seattle when he was just a teenager.
On Sunday, it was McGinn who said through his Twitter account that the time for victim blaming and denials is over, and that the Democratic Mayor must resign. That same day, Farrell reacted to the new information regarding Murray’s former foster son, by explaining through a statement that this new information severely undermines their confidence in Murray’s ability to carry out the duties and responsibilities of his office.
On another hand, Oliver issued a statement yesterday, saying that the revelations of the Oregon Child Protective Services against Ed Murray are terrible, and that Seattle voters would definitely have voted differently if they had known this horrible information at the time.
Oliver showed a strong stance on this issue. She added that even when Murray must resign, it is important that this decision doesn’t end up being just a hollow gesture to make everyone feel better while doing nothing significant to address the failures in the systems that put children at risk of predation. Oliver concluded that if Murray doesn’t hold himself to account at this point, the burden falls on other elected officials and also on the city council.
Yesterday, candidate Jerry Durkan said in a statement that she spoke briefly with Murray on Sunday night and told him she was very troubled.
The first details about Simpson’s claims were revealed back in April when a Kent man called Delvonn Heckard filed a lawsuit against the Mayor, saying that he sexually assaulted him in the 1980s in Seattle when he was just a teenager. He eventually withdrew his lawsuit a month ago assuring he will refile after the Mayor leaves office.
Soon after the lawsuit against Murray was dropped, Farrell told she was shocked and incredibly surprised to hear the news. At the time she showed her support for Murray by saying her heart goes out to him and his husband Michael Shiosaki. In fact, she even told that Seattle must reject the politics of personal destruction, explaining that voters and leaders deserve better.
Yesterday, candidate Jerry Durkan said in a statement that she spoke briefly with Murray on Sunday night and told him she was very troubled. Durkan added that while she believes the Mayor has made a really good job, he should reflect on whether he could continue to lead and what is in the best interests of Seattle.

Naturally, Durkan’s comments seem quite surprising considering that last month Murray endorsed her, and later Monday, when asked in a KUOW radio interview whether she was calling on Murray to resign, she said that no one is in position to judge what happened 30 years ago. Nevertheless, she told that facts matter a lot.
Soon after receiving Murray’s endorsement last month, she was asked if she would accept it from a man who several men had accused of sexual abuse. Believe it or not, in addition to not answer the question, Durkan said that these people would be able to observe Murray has been a great mayor, no matter if the claims are true.",Conservative Daily Post,1
Education cuts causes Oklahoma 'Teacher of the Year' to leave state,"July 2 (UPI) -- Oklahoma's ""teacher of the year"" in 2016 has decided to move to Texas after the state's education cuts have left teacher salaries stagnant.
Sheehan and his wife, who is also a teacher, said that cuts to Oklahoma's education budget has forced them to look elsewhere for job opportunities due to the state's low teacher pay and their growing family.
According to Oklahoma Watch, the average teacher salary, depending on the district, tends to range between $36,000 and $44,000.
The celebrated math teacher told NPR that he and his wife earn about $3,600 each month and after bills are paid, they are left with only $400 to $450 per month.
""Sure, life can be done on $400, $450 a month, but I would challenge others out there to buy diapers, groceries and all the things that you need for a family of three on $400,"" he said.
""This decision wasn't an easy one. Not by a long shot. Our circle of friends can attest to that,"" Sheehan wrote in a blog post announcing his move. ""I considered other jobs, tried to find adjunct positions, and my wife and I have worked very hard to pay off our debt in bigger chunks. But at the end of the day, the simple truth is that we can be paid a respectable wage for doing the same job - this job we love very much - by heading out of state.""
Cuts to Oklahoma's education budget has led to cuts in art classes, athletics, advanced coursework, and dozens of districts have implemented four-day weeks, canceling classes on either Friday or Monday.
""The problems facing Oklahoma are our own doing. There's not some outside force that is causing our schools not to be able to stay open,"" Democratic state Sen. John Sparks told the Washington Post. ""These are all the result of a bad public policy and a lack of public-sector investment.""",United Press International – US,0
New Disclosures Show the FBI’s Investigation of Hillary’s Emails Was Badly “Mishandled”,"It looks like Hillary Clinton’s email troubles aren’t going away.
In hindsight, it’s hilarious to see how many liberals thought that former FBI director James Comey was in cahoots with Donald Trump because the FBI was investigating Clinton’s private email server. But I think we can safely say that Comey exercised his discretion in letting her off the hook.
After all, remember what Comey said when declaring that she was innocent. It sounded like he was going to recommend charges – before he didn’t. Comey confirmed that Hillary lied about never having sent classified information, that she lied about having had provided the FBI with all her emails, and that she lied about numerous other things.
Comey’s defense is that “intent” was the key factor here. Sure, Hillary broke the law, but it’s the intent that matters!
Never before has “intent” mattered so much. He surely must realize that there are punishments given in many legal cases even without intent – such as the charge of “involuntary manslaughter.” That’s a bit of an extreme example, but there have been similar cases to Hillary’s involving classified information where “intent” was never part of the equation.
Plus, as the National Review’s Andrew McCarthy noted, Hillary could’ve been charged with gross negligence.
Subsection (f) of the pertinent statute (the Espionage Act, codified at Section 793 of Title 18, U.S. Code) makes it a felony to mishandle classified information “through gross negligence” — i.e., proving Clinton was sloppy or careless (or “extremely careless,” to use Comey’s own description) could have been sufficient. But beyond that, Clinton willfully set up a private network for the systematic handling of her State Department-related communications, in violation of federal record-keeping requirements of which she was well aware, and under circumstances in which she (a former senator who served for years on the intelligence Armed Services committee) was a sophisticated longtime consumer of classified information.
While it’s a bummer that we never got to “lock her up,” we at least will never have to utter the words “President Hillary Clinton.” Now that the FBI investigation is long behind us, Hillary’s emails are being made public…. and that could change things. New documents related to the investigation are raising questions about the entire FBI investigation into Clinton’s email practices, none of which are good.
The FBI released a trove of previously-unseen documents relating to the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified material on Wednesday, highlighting the bureau’s “flawed” approach to the probe that was hindered by a “lack of cooperation” from the failed democratic nominee.
According to Fox News, the materials were released under the name “Grand Jury Material,” implying the documents would be used in a trial had former FBI director James Comey decided to charge Clinton with a crime.
Judicial Watch, a government watchdog agency, secured the release of the controversial records.
In one previously redacted document, Clinton’s attorney agrees to provide the FBI with Hillary’s Apple iPads and BlackBerry cellular phones. When some of the devices arrived at the bureau, the SIM cards had been removed as well as the digital hard drives; others simply never arrived or were previously destroyed.
“We are presuming there are still 13 devices at issue,” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton told Fox News. “The new records show how badly the Obama Justice Department and FBI mishandled the Clinton email investigation.”
In all, there remains nearly 200 redactions in the 42 pages released by the FBI. “The Trump Justice Department needs to audit this mess and figure out if the Clinton matters need to be reopened or reinvigorated,” he added.
Why shouldn’t Trump investigate further? There’s one campaign promise I think we’d all particularly love to see the president follow through on:
But seriously, read that again. This part blows me away: “In one previously redacted document, Clinton’s attorney agrees to provide the FBI with Hillary’s Apple iPads and BlackBerry cellular phones. When some of the devices arrived at the bureau, the SIM cards had been removed as well as the digital hard drives; others simply never arrived or were previously destroyed.”
Hillary’s team deliberately gave the FBI incomplete information and deliberately interfered in the investigation. “Obstruction of justice,” anyone? I know that’s a hot word among Democrats these days. Why won’t they apply it to Hillary in this case?
Oh wait, we already know the answer.

MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough And Washington Post’s Eugene Robinson Give Advice to Democrats,"Most of us have been yelling at the top of our lungs how the media is biased toward conservative views and how journalists bash Republicans every time they get a chance.
On Tuesday, MSNBC Joe Scarborough and Washington Post’s Eugene Robinson felt it was their time to give the Democrats a pep talk on how to recover from the funk they are currently in.
Now, let’s look at this. The liberal agenda has done nothing to help the American people in the way of creating jobs, promoting family values, and eradicating racism from the political and every day playing field. In fact, Democrats created a narrative to keep minorities communities rushing to them for benefits and handouts.
Robinson complained how the Democrats need a plan, a message, and a sense of urgency. Scarborough, of course, agreed. The only problem with both of their assessments is Democrats do not have a leader nor do they want to come back from the hell they created. They want to bash Trump, thinking they are making gains when they are traveling way off course.
“Democrats need a unifying strong message about how they’re going to get Americans back to work,” MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough commented on Tuesday.
“Even when we have Democrats here on this show and say, ‘Hey, we have a new message about how to get Americans back to work’…I haven’t heard anything that’s going to unite voters together and make independents, and some moderate Republicans go, ‘Wait a second, I think I want to follow the Democratic Party,’” Scarborough continued.
Robinson agreed with Scarborough’s assessment, saying that he also hasn’t heard a unifying message coming from the Democratic Party.
“There has to be a message, there has to be a reason for people to rally to the Democratic side, and it can’t be just that…Donald Trump is awful,” Robinson concluded. “[Democrat’s] need a positive message, and it has to be simple, and it has to be brief, and it has to connect with people, and frankly we have not heard that yet from the Democratic Party.”
Watch these MSNBC panelists’ advice for losing Democrats:
Here’s a shocker for you: The Democrats haven’t had a real message for more than 50 years. They have replayed the same template, election after election, and as people got older and smarter, the party got dumber and irrelevant. This didn’t just happen because of Trump getting elected. This has been happening for a while. Trump just kicked the door open, or shut the door, whatever idiom you prefer.

Senate Democrats Are Furious To Find Out What Republicans Just Took Away From Them,"The base salary of a U.S. senator is $174K a year. That’s nearly five times the amount of money that the average American earns every year. To put it in simple perspective, you would have to work five times longer than a junior senator to earn a gallon of milk. A gallon of milk, on the average is about three bucks. Let’s say you earn a $9 an hour. You’d have to work 20 minutes in order to buy that gallon of milk. A U.S. senator would have to work 4 minutes for that same gallon.
Which often has people pointing out the fact that the only “company” in the world that pays its employees more than its employer is the government. Everywhere around the globe, civil servants (also called “elected officials” or “politicians”) earn a boatload more than their employers, the taxpayers. It’s a crazy phenomenon, but it’s absolutely true.
In order for us to get our money’s worth then, it is assumed that they are going to be working their butts off for that lucrative salary and its mountain of benefits, particularly when so much is backlogged. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell received an interesting letter from a host of Senators who requested a delay in the August Recess for the Senate in order to get their work done. Amazingly, McConnell agreed! And Democrats are furious.
The Senate will work in Washington during the first two weeks of August, instead of allowing senators to be back in their home states.
“Once the Senate completes its work on health care reform, we will turn to other important issues including the National Defense Authorization Act and the backlog of critical nominations that have been mindlessly stalled by Democrats,” McConnell said in a statement.
McConnell, who was under pressure to cancel August recess altogether by members of his party, made the announcement during a weekly lunchtime meeting with his conference.
The group of Republican senators, led by Georgia Sen. David Perdue, sent a letter to McConnell on June 30 asking to “truncate” or “forgo” the August Recess all together given the limited number of legislative days on the calendar available.
The letter was signed by Republican Senators Perdue, Steve Daines, of Montana, Joni Ernst of Iowa, John Kennedy Louisiana, James Lankford Oklahoma, Mike Lee of Utah, Mike Rounds of South Dakota, Luther Strange of Alabama, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina.
This was important for these Republican senators because there has been an almost constant Democrat attempt to drag their heels on nearly every piece of legislation or procedural vote, going back to Trump’s inauguration.
This move will instill the Senate Majority Leader with just a tad more respect from Trump supporters as well as they have become somewhat distrustful of everything the Republican establishment has done to date. Hopefully, the two weeks will be enough time to effect real and purposeful change.

For 34 years, the Friends of Bush Gardens have hosted a plant sale adjacent to the Salem Art Fair & Festival, and this year is no exception.
In the shade of the Bush House Museum, on the south side of the house, the Friends will host their annual sale and give local residents a chance to buy plants from around the world but grown by local growers.
Gretchen Carnaby and Anita Engberg, two of the Friends, said 10 local growers will be showing off their wares at the sale. Many will stick around and answer questions, Carnaby said.
There will be cane flowers, dwarf conifers, Japanese maples and herbs aplenty to name just a few of the plants. If you plant for color, know that there will be deep purples, sunset colors as well as plants that attract hummingbirds. The growers will restock daily though the women say the best selection will be offered on Friday.
Carnaby and Engberg said the event helps the community support local growers at reasonable prices and show their support for the Bush Gardens since the sale is a fundraiser for them.
As in past years, the Friends will gladly hold and protect purchased plants while sale-goers attend the art fair, and they will also offer curbside pick-up (drive up and load your purchases instead of having to schlep them to a car).
Admission to the art fair is not required to attend the plant sale. It will be held from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Friday and Saturday, and from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday.

Trump set a red line for Robert Mueller. And now Mueller has reportedly crossed it.,"Robert Mueller, FBI director at the time, testifies on Capitol Hill on June 13, 2012. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)
Bloomberg News is reporting that the Russia investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller is zeroing in on President Trump's business transactions.
The report quoted an anonymous source as saying that Trump's financial ties to Russia are the focus: “FBI investigators and others are looking at Russian purchases of apartments in Trump buildings, Trump’s involvement in a controversial SoHo development with Russian associates, the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow and Trump's sale of a Florida mansion to a Russian oligarch in 2008.” The Washington Post has not independently confirmed Bloomberg’s report.
Somebody is basically daring Trump to try to fire Mueller.
Just a day before the Bloomberg report, in an interview with the New York Times, Trump said this is precisely the thing that for him would cross a “red line” with Mueller. The Times's reporters repeatedly asked what would constitute Mueller going too far, and eventually Trump agreed that probing his business and his family's financial dealings would be a “violation.”
It has previously been reported that the Russia investigation has focused on the business dealings of Trump's son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, but this appears to be the first indication that Trump's own finances are under scrutiny.
In the Times interview, Trump didn't quite say he would try to fire Mueller for such a thing, but he sure hinted at it. Here's the transcript:
MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT: Last thing, if Mueller was looking at your finances and your family finances, unrelated to Russia — is that a red line?
MAGGIE HABERMAN: Would that be a breach of what his actual charge is?
TRUMP: I would say yeah. I would say yes. By the way, I would say, I don’t — I don’t — I mean, it’s possible there’s a condo or something, so, you know, I sell a lot of condo units, and somebody from Russia buys a condo, who knows? I don’t make money from Russia. In fact, I put out a letter saying that I don’t make — from one of the most highly respected law firms, accounting firms. I don’t have buildings in Russia. They said I own buildings in Russia. I don’t. They said I made money from Russia. I don’t. It’s not my thing. I don’t, I don’t do that. Over the years, I’ve looked at maybe doing a deal in Russia, but I never did one. Other than I held the Miss Universe pageant there eight, nine years. [CROSSTALK]
SCHMIDT: But if he was outside that lane, would that mean he’d have to go?
HABERMAN: Would you consider —
TRUMP: No, I think that’s a violation. Look, this is about Russia. So I think if he wants to go, my finances are extremely good, my company is an unbelievably successful company. And actually, when I do my filings, peoples say, “Man.” People have no idea how successful this is. It’s a great company. But I don’t even think about the company anymore.
HABERMAN: Would you fire Mueller if he went outside of certain parameters of what his charge is? [crosstalk]
SCHMIDT: What would you do?
TRUMP: I can’t, I can’t answer that question, because I don’t think it’s going to happen.
And then it happened.
Trump has reportedly thought about trying to fire Mueller before. Trump ally and Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy said last month that Trump was “considering perhaps terminating” Mueller — something the White House sought to play down and Ruddy tried publicly to talk Trump out of.
It's not clear that Trump can fire Mueller even if he wanted to, though. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who is overseeing Mueller's probe after appointing him, has said that only he can fire Mueller and that he wouldn't do it simply at Trump's request, without “good cause.”
The Fix's Amber Phillips breaks down that whole process here.
It's also not clear that Mueller's probe is restricted in any way, legally speaking. Jeffrey Jacobovitz, a white-collar lawyer who represented officials in the Clinton White House, said there's pretty much no limit.
“Mueller's designation as special counsel is very broad, and he will be looking at both direct and indirect issues related to Russia and the campaign,” Jacobovitz said. “If you recall, Spiro Agnew was convicted of tax evasion, and the Clinton independent counsel evolved from Whitewater to an affair. So independent counsels have a lot discretion in terms of what they investigate.”
But just because it would be difficult doesn't mean Trump wouldn't attempt it. He has shown that he's willing to fire people who run afoul of him before (see: Comey, James B.) even as it resulted in Mueller investigating him for potential obstruction of justice. And he also doesn't have much regard for the normal legal processes and the rule of law.
Firing Mueller, though, would be the equivalent of firing Comey times 10 on the controversy scale. Now the ball, it seems, is in Trump's court.

Obama Caught Stealing Key Item From Trump’s White House And Now Is Going To Pay 6 Times Over For It,"During the presidential race, Obama and his minion Susan Rice did everything they could to keep Trump from getting into office, even resorting to unlawful spying on Trump’s transition team to collect “dirt” they could then take to the liberal media. While Rice tried to state that the unmasking (spying) wasn’t for any “political purpose,” she’s now flat-out refusing to explain herself in front of congress. Several days ago, we learned that Obama is now getting involved to cover the Democrats’ asses, taking documents related to the unmasking and locking them up in his presidential library. But unfortunately for Obama, Trump is about to make him pay dearly for his antics, after the long arm of the law just came crashing down on his treasonous head.
Obama and Susan Rice conducting their dirty plots
Earlier this week, FOX News broke the scandal of how the Democrats are now trying to bury evidence that would prove their guilt of illegal spying on Trump and his transition team during the election by simply making the documents off-limits to the public for the next five years. They reported:
Records relating to former National Security Advisor Susan Rice’s surveillance of Americans, including Trump campaign and transition officials, have been sealed at the Barack Obama Presidential Library.
That means they are off-limits from the public for the next five years under the Presidential Records Act.
In April, reports emerged that Rice had requested to “unmask” — or unveil the hidden names of — Trump transition officials who were caught up in surveillance of foreign targets.
Obviously Obama and his team of morons have something pretty dirty to hide, otherwise why would they be locking away these documents in his Presidential Library? The good news is that President Trump isn’t an idiot, and he has an incredible team of lawyers and experts who continually provide input on how to combat Democrats’ endless BS. Judicial Watch is now operating on President Trump’s behalf, and have just come up with an incredible plan to make Obama pay. On Monday, the watchdog group filed six Freedom of Information lawsuits surrounding the “surveillance, unmasking, and illegal leaking targeting [of] President Trump and his associates.” Here’s more details about what’s in the documents that they’ve filed against Obama from their website:
Judicial Watch today announced that the National Security Council (NSC) on May 23, 2017, informed it by letter that the materials regarding the unmasking by Obama National Security Advisor Susan Rice of “the identities of any U.S. citizens associated with the Trump presidential campaign or transition team” have been removed to the Obama Library.
TRENDING ON FREEDOM DAILY
* 24 Hrs After McCain Busted For Ties to London Terrorist, Another Skeleton Comes Falling Out Of His Closet
Judicial Watch’s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) April 4 request sought:
1.) Any and all requests for information, analyses, summaries, assessments, transcripts, or similar records submitted to any Intelligence Community member agency or any official, employee, or representative thereof by former National Security Advisor Susan Rice regarding, concerning, or related to the following:
* Any actual or suspected effort by the Russian government or any individual acting on behalf of the Russian government to influence or otherwise interfere with the 2016 presidential election.
* The alleged hacking of computer systems utilized by the Democratic National Committee and/or the Clinton presidential campaign.
* Any actual or suspected communication between any member of the Trump presidential campaign or transition team and any official or employee of the Russian government or any individual acting on behalf of the Russian government.
* The identities of U.S. citizens associated with the Trump presidential campaign or transition team who were identified pursuant to intelligence collection activities.
2.) Any and all records or responses received by former National Security Advisor Susan Rice and/or any member, employee, staff member, or representative of the National Security Council in response to any request described in part 1 of this request.
3.) Any and all records of communication between any official, employee, or representative of the Department of any Intelligence Community member agency and former National Security Advisor Susan Rice and/or any member, employee, staff member, or representative of the National Security Council regarding, concerning, or related to any request described in Part 1 of this request.
The hypocrisy of the left truly knows no bounds. As rabid Democrats continue to be relentless in their efforts to destroy President Trump, with their latest hysteria being that the president “obstructed justice,” the real person “obstructing justice” is Obama and the Democrats, as they’ve now stolen White House documents and are actively trying to subvert justice from keeping this information from the American people.
Hopefully Judicial Watch will be able to get these documents and expose this scandal. If citing the Freedom of Information Act does not work, the other option is for President Trump is to get Congress or a special prosecutor to compel Obama and the Democrats to produce the evidence.
Be sure to share this story and help get the word out about who is REALLY “obstructing justice.” It’s Barack Hussein Obama and the Democrats!

4 reasons Israeli and allied aggression against Syria must be condemned,"Adam Garrie20 hours agoJuly 2, 2017 664
Israel's consistent, illegal and dangerous attacks on Syrian sovereignty must be condemned. Anything less means that the UN will have lost even more credibility in the eyes of the wider world.
Israel has yet again fired on Syrian troops near al-Quneitra in the Golan Heights. This comes as for over a week, Israel has been consistently hitting Syrian targets in the region where the Syrian Arab Army is engaged in fierce fighting with al-Qaeda/al-Nusra terrorists.
Due to the consistency of these attacks from Israel, it is necessary for the United Nations to condemn Israel’s atrocities.
Here are the reasons Israel should be condemned by the UN.
1. Israel is acting without legal justification.
Israel cannot justify its attacks on Syria. Syria is not threatening Israel and judging by the fact that Israel often treats wounded al-Qaeda terrorists in its hospitals, al-Qaeda is clearly not a threat to Israel either.
The internal struggle for Syrian survival should not be molested by any foreign state or non-state power unless explicitly given permission by the Syrian government or the United Nations.
Israel has been given no such permission and of course, never will be.
Therefore, Israel’s attacks on sovereign Syrian territory without provocation are war crimes.
2. Israel must withdraw from occupied Syrian territory and respect Syrian territorial integrity
Since 1967, Israel has occupied a large portion of the Gloan Heights. The Golan Heights in its entirety is recognised by the UN and every UN member-state as Syrian territory. Israel must peacefully and immediately withdraw from this territory.
3. Israel, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, the USA, France, UK, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Hamas, al-Qaeda and ISIS must be jointly condemned for infringing upon Syrian’s sovereignty and territorial integrity
All of the aforementioned countries and groups have at one time or another, including at present, violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria.
The UN’s primary goal is to defend the rights of nations to exist without interference in their sovereign affairs and without illegal foreign activity, including military activity from happening on their territory.
These acts against Syrian sovereignty must be unequivocally condemned.
4. Sanctions are terrorism
The UN must condemn all countries which are participating in or helping the process of sanctioning Syria. These sanctions, even more than the terrorist attacks upon Syria have caused a human rights disaster and should be understood as a crime against humanity which has deprived the Syrian people of much needed medical supplies.
If the UN passed such a resolution, it would go a long way in restoring the body’s credibility before the eyes of the wider world. Of course, such a resolution would only be possible as a non-binding General Assembly resolution. Were such a statement to be brought before the Security Council, it would of course be vetoed by the Untied States and its allies.",The Duran,1
Rapporteur asks Brazil lower house committee to accept charge against Temer,"Brazilian President Michel Temer is seen at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany July 7, 2017.
BRASILIA The rapporteur for a Brazilian lower house committee examining a corruption charge against President Michel Temer recommended on Monday that the body vote to put Temer on trial.
Deputy Sergio Zveiter's recommendation was widely expected. The full 66-member committee is likely to vote later this week on the charge against Temer before the full house vote.
Under Brazilian law, two-thirds of the lower house's 513 members must approve the charge against Temer for it to move to the Supreme Court. The top court then must vote on whether it accepts the charge. I it does, Temer will stand trial and immediately be suspended from the presidency for up to 180 days. House Speaker Rodrigo Maia would temporarily take the presidency in that case.

American Airlines drops maker of uniforms after employee health complaints,"June 22 (UPI) -- American Airlines announced it will seek a new vendor for its uniforms after numerous complaints by employees.
In a statement Wednesday, American Airlines Group Inc. said the company will not renew its contract with clothing manufacturer Twin Hill, a division of Tailored Brands Inc. when the contract expires in 2020. Twin Hill maintains its uniforms for flight crews and customer service agents are safe; the airline has received 3,500 complaints regarding fatigue, skin rashes, headaches and other adverse reactions since Twin Hill began outfitting the employees in September.
The manufacturer accepted the decision to end of the contract but not the blame for causing ailments among American Airlines employees. It said in a statement, ""Twin Hill has determined that the reputational risk, management distraction, and legal and other costs associated with serving American in the future would be unacceptable to our business, given the likelihood of continued unfounded allegations about the safety of our garments.""
Finding a new supplier and producing enough garments will be a two-to-three year undertaking, the airline said, adding that the Association of Professional Flight Attendants will be involved in the process.
""We're pleased that American Airlines has announced today that it will begin the process of ordering and delivering new uniforms for flight attendants and other American employees.

"Salvador Dalí's body exhumed, mustache still in ""classic shape""","APJuly 21, 2017, 6:43 AM
 
FIGUERES, Spain -- Forensic experts in Spain have removed hair, nails and two long bones from Salvador Dalí's embalmed remains to find genetic samples for a paternity test -- a move that opens the possibility for a woman who says she is the surrealist artist's daughter to claim part of the Dalí estate.
Officials said Friday that the artist's mummified remains were so well conserved that even his famous mustache had survived the passing of time and remained in ""its classic shape of ten past ten,"" referring to the positions of the hands on a clock.
Dalí was buried in the Dalí Museum Theater in the northeastern Spanish town of Figueres, his birthplace, when he died at 84 years old in 1989. The exhumation followed longstanding claims by Pilar Abel, a 61-year-old tarot card reader, who says her mother had an affair with Dalí in the town.
Artist Salvador Dalí to be exhumed over paternity suit
Surrealist master Salvador Dalí is at the center of a bizarre paternity lawsuit. A woman who claims to be his daughter from an affair wants to se...
In June, a Madrid judge finally ruled that a DNA test should be performed to find out whether her allegations were true.
Forensic experts opened the artist's coffin Thursday night in a sensitive operation that involved using pulleys to lift a 1.5-ton stone slab.
Lluis Penuelas Reixach, the secretary general of the Gala Dalí Foundation, said Dalí's remains -- including his mustache -- are well conserved, mummified after the embalming process applied 27 years ago. He was speaking to reporters Friday during a press conference in Figueres.
According to judicial authorities, only five people -- a judge, three coroners and an assistant -- were allowed to oversee the removal of the samples out of respect for the remains and in order to avoid any contamination.
Representatives of the foundation managing Dalí's estate said Friday the evidence backing Abel's claims weren't enough to justify the intrusive exhumation, and that it will continue a legal battle to nullify the paternity test.
Dalí and his Russian wife Gala -- whose birth name was Elena Ivanovna Diakonova -- had no children of their own, although Gala had a daughter from an earlier marriage to French poet Paul Eluard.
A general view of Dali's Theater Museum in Figueres, Spain.
Abel, who for a while made her living by reading tarot cards on local television, was born in Girona, a city close to Figueres. She has fought for the exhumation because she wants legal proof that the artist was her biological father after an alleged affair between her mother and Dalí.
If proved right, she could claim one fourth of the painter's estate which is now in the hands of a public foundation, according to her lawyer Enrique Blanquez. There are no current estimates of the value of that fortune.
If she is proved wrong, the Dalí foundation will seek financial compensation for the costs of the exhumation.
Either way, minimizing the disruption to the museum's operations and to the rest of Dalí's remains is the priority for the foundation managing Dalí's estate, according to its secretary. ""It's important for Salvador Dalí to be returned to rest in the interior of his museum's dome,"" Penuelas said.
During a press conference this week, Abel explained how her mother and grandmother told the family secret when Abel was still young. Years later, she said she asked her mother again, who confirmed to her the story was true.
The foundation and the museum in Figueres took steps to make sure no images of the exhumation may emerge in public. Before work in the crypt began on Thursday, mobile phones were put in a deposit and a marquee was installed under the museum's glass dome to prevent any photography or video from drones.
The biological samples will travel to a forensic laboratory in Madrid for analysis, a process that could take weeks.

Breaking: Arrested Pakistani IT Guy Given Terrifying Item by Pelosi!,"Are you really that surprised to know that an IT administrator from Pakistan made over $4 million while employed by the Democrats? Were you even suprised to hear that the Awan brothers smashed computers? How about that they had access to sensitive or classified information? Somehow, none of this surprises me.
This scumbag was employed by Debbie Blabbermouth Schultz since 2005. Are you really going to tell me, they didn’t have a clue about what he did for them and the DNC? The Awan brothers not only had access to Debbie’s ipad, they also had access to Pelosi’s. Personally, I’m guessing a lot more news is going to come out…whether it gets reported or not by the MSM, that’s another story.
Politico reported that Imran Awan was arrested at Dulles International Airport as he was trying to flee the country for Lahore, Pakistan. He faced arraignment in federal court Tuesday on a charge of bank fraud related to a home mortgage scheme, though he is suspected of committing other crimes and will likely face additional charges in the near future.
The IT staffer who has worked with dozens of Democrat members of Congress has been under criminal investigation for several months for alleged procurement theft, and is suspected of stealing money, equipment and information — potentially of the classified variety — from those for whom he worked.
The Gateway Pundit noted that Julian Assange of WikiLeaks on Tuesday posted to his Twitter account a portion of an email showing that Awan had access to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s iPad, a device that likely held state secrets and other sensitive information.
Wasserman Schultz IT staffer arrested trying to leave country.
6:56 PM – Jul 25, 2017
That email, part of a larger chain sent May 12, 2016, from one Wasserman Schultz aide to another, read, in part: “Pelosi is doing s(sic) closed door meeting. No staff or anyone allowed. Kaitlyn come to Rayburn room and get her iPad for Imran. Thanks.”
Though it is entirely possible that Pelosi was unaware of the IT staffer who was presumably doing routine maintenance on her iPad, considering the fact that Awan worked on Capitol Hill for years and provided IT service for dozens of Democrat lawmakers, it is equally as likely that she was acquainted with or at least aware of Awan.
Thus, it was rather strange when Pelosi was asked directly about the ongoing investigation of Awan by a reporter during a news conference in May and the Minority Leader claimed to be unfamiliar with both Awan and the suspicions swirling around him, according to the Washington Free Beacon.
Asked about the investigation, Pelosi initially replied, “Well, the people who are under investigation are the Attorney General of the United States. I mean, what are we talking about here?”
Asked if Awan should still be employed by Democrat members of Congress — he was only released from Wasserman Schultz’s payroll Tuesday — Pelosi dodged the question and stated, “I’m not familiar — you have a very specific charge there. I haven’t followed that so closely. We’ve been busy with a lot of other things.”
“But, there are plenty of people who are under investigation who still have their jobs,” she quickly added, no doubt a shot at members of the Trump administration.
You can watch Pelosi dance around the pointed questions about Imran Awan right here:
The question has now become, how long has Awan had access to devices used by leaders and members of the Democrat party, and exactly what did he do with the information contained therein?
Looks like we may be finally getting to the bottom of the scum in the DC swamp that Obama and Hillary maintained in DC over the last 8 years.
Let me know when the MSM starts talking about the murder of Molly MacCauley and the Awan brothers.
Until then…..Hey Debbie! You got some ‘splainin’ to do!",Ihavethetruth,1

New details on driver in Texas immigrant-smuggling case,"CBS/APJuly 25, 2017, 8:36 PM
Driver in Texas immigrant-smuggling case had suspended license
James Bradley Jr. should never have been driving the tractor trailer that carried roughly 100 illegal immigrants into San Antonio. Florida had suspended his commercial driving license back in April, CBS News correspondent Mark Strassmann reports.
Bradley Jr. lost his commercial driving privileges after he failed to provide the state with a current medical card, which federal law requires commercial drivers to submit to show they are physically fit for the road.
Alexis Bakofsky, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, told The Associated Press it would have been illegal for him to have had an additional license from another state.
Authorities said Bradley's truck was discovered Sunday morning in a Walmart parking lot crammed with dozens of immigrants.
Ten people died, including 20 year-old Frank Fuentes, who graduated high school in Virginia but had been deported, Strassmann reports. More than a dozen survivors remained hospitalized Tuesday, some in critical condition.
Shane Foldin, the special agent in charge of San Antonio's Homeland Security office, is leading the criminal investigation.
""It's never just the driver by himself or herself,"" Foldin told Strassmann.
""These organizations simply consider these people a commodity. They don't think of them as people they look at them from a profit perspective,"" he said.
Bradley, 60, faces charges of illegally transporting immigrants for financial gain resulting in death, possibly punishable by life in prison or the death penalty.
He has yet to enter a plea in connection with this disastrous tractor trailer run to San Antonio, and will be back in court on Thursday, Strassmann reports.
Florida records show that his medical card on file with the highway department expired on March 15 and he was notified to update it. He never did.
Bradley's fiancee, Darnisha Rose, told The AP that he is from Florida originally but had been spending most of his time in Louisville, Kentucky, as his health worsened. Bradley had diabetes that he hadn't properly treated, she said, and had to have a series of amputations, most recently the removal of his leg this spring.
Federal law requires commercial drivers to be screened by a doctor for serious medical conditions that might impair their ability to safely operate their vehicles.
""The medical card certification is extremely serious business. Drivers watch it like hawks because you can't drive a truck without it,"" said Kenneth S. Armstrong, the president of the Florida Trucking Association who reviewed Bradley's driving record for The AP. ""When you're moving a 50, 60, 70, 80,000-pound vehicle along the road, we hold those people to a higher health standard than a typical passenger car driver.""

Armstrong said the lack of a valid commercial license would have likely been caught had Bradley gone through an inspection station or been stopped by law enforcement.
But Bradley had not been out on the road for months.
Rose said Bradley, a lifelong truck driver, left Louisville on July 14 for his first trip since his leg was amputated in May. He had worked for Pyle Transportation, a trucking company in Iowa, for several years, and was preparing to strike out on his own once he got a prosthetic leg this month, she said.
In February, he purchased a custom Peterbilt truck for $90,000 from a company called Outlaw Iron in Wisconsin, according to Justin McDaniel, the company's owner. McDaniel said he had never before met Bradley, who responded to an advertisement for the truck. Bradley came to Wisconsin to buy the truck, paid $50,000 cash and financed the remaining $40,000. The truck did not come with a trailer, McDaniel said.
""It's hard to believe it, just from meeting the gentleman, he was a super nice guy, very stand-up guy,"" McDaniel said. ""I'm sure there's more to the story than what we're seeing.""

McDaniel said Bradley showed the Florida driver's license when making the purchase.
Florida originally issued him a commercial license in 2004, according to state records. By then he already had a criminal history.
Bakofsky said the screening process for licensing commercial drivers focuses on their driving record and crimes related to traffic infractions.
In 1997, Bradley pleaded guilty in a felony domestic violence case in Colorado and was sentenced to two years' probation, said Rich Orman, chief deputy district attorney for the 18th Judicial District in suburban Denver. He had been arrested the year before after his wife, visibly injured, told police he ""beat her up,"" an officer wrote in an affidavit.
""She continued to say that her husband also took a handgun, pulled the hammer back thus 'cocking' it, pointed it at her and told her he was going to kill her,"" the affidavit says. His probation in that case was transferred to Florida.
Then in 1998 he was arrested in Ohio and extradited to Colorado for violating his probation, Orman said. Records show that at that time, Bradley also was wanted by a Texas agency for an unknown charge. Another probation violation complaint came in 1999, but Bradley wasn't arrested and returned to Colorado until 2003.
Human trafficking survivors cling to life in Texas
At least nine people were killed after being packed into a sweltering tractor-trailer in San Antonio, Texas. About 30 others remain hospitalized....
He was sentenced to three years in a halfway house, but he violated terms of that sentence -- he apparently left the facility to look for a job and never returned -- and in 2005 was sentenced to one year in a Colorado prison, Orman said.
He was released in 2007, according to the Department of Corrections, and remained on parole until 2009.
He has also been cited repeatedly over the years for violating federal motor carrier safety regulations in Iowa dating back to 1995. At least two of the tickets were for logging more hours than allowed. The most recent infraction came in April 2013, when he was ticketed for violating a rule that bars truckers from driving longer than 14 hours without a break. The citation shows that he was driving for Pyle Transportation. He was fined $127.50.
Rose defended her fiance as a good man who would always try to help people in need. She said he is beside himself over what happened and told her during a jailhouse call that he had no idea his trailer was packed with people until he left Walmart and noticed it rocking back and forth. He flung the doors open and found the people inside, some already dead and dying.
Court documents indicate he did not call 911. Authorities were alerted by store employees.

CARACAS, Venezuela - A police helicopter fired on Venezuela’s Supreme Court and Interior Ministry in what President Nicolas Maduro said was a thwarted “terrorist attack” aimed at ousting him from power.
The confusing exchange, which is bound to ratchet up tensions in a country already paralyzed by months of deadly anti-government protests, took place as Maduro was speaking live on state television Tuesday. He later said the helicopter had fired on the pro-government court with grenades, one of which didn’t go off, helping avoid any loss of life.
Adding to the intrigue, pictures of a blue police helicopter carrying an anti-government banner appeared on social media around the same time as a video in which an alleged police pilot, identified as Oscar Perez, called for a rebellion against Maduro’s “tyranny” as part of a coalition of members of the country’s security forces. Authorities said they were still searching for the man.
“We have two choices: be judged tomorrow by our conscience and the people or begin today to free ourselves from this corrupt government,” the man said while reading from a statement with four people dressed in military fatigues, ski masks and carrying what looked like assault rifles standing behind him.
Many of Maduro’s opponents took to social media to accuse the president of orchestrating an elaborate ruse to justify a crackdown against Venezuelans seeking to block his plans to rewrite the constitution. Venezuela has been roiled by anti-government protests the past three months that have left at least 75 people dead and hundreds injured.
After the incident, Maduro sounded alternately calm and angry as he told the audience about what had happened in the airspace just beyond the presidential palace.
“It could’ve caused a tragedy with several dozen dead and injured,” he said, calling it a “terrorist attack.”
Later, Information Minister Ernesto Villegas read a statement from the government accusing the helicopter of firing 15 shots against the Interior Ministry as a reception was taking place for 80 people celebrating national journalist’s day. It then flew a short distance to the court, which was in session, and launched what he said were four Israeli-made grenades of “Colombian origin,” two of them against national guardsmen protecting the building.
The pro-government president of the high court said there were no injuries from the attack and that the area was still being surveyed for damages.
Villegas said security forces were being deployed to apprehend Perez as well as recover the heisted German-built Bolkow helicopter. Photos of the pilot standing in front of the U.S. Capitol in Washington and a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter were displayed on state television to further bolster the government’s case that he was taking instructions from the CIA and the U.S. Embassy.
Maduro said one of the pilots involved in the alleged attack used to fly for his former interior minister, Miguel Rodriguez Torres, who he accused of working for the CIA. Rodriguez Torres, who has been leading a campaign against Maduro made up of leftist supporters of the late Hugo Chavez, immediately dismissed the accusation as baseless.
Amid Venezuela political crisis, shortages of medicine soar
As the drama was unfolding outside the court, inside magistrates were busy issuing a number of rulings further hemming in the opposition. One dismissed a challenge against Maduro’s plans for a constitutional assembly by chief prosecutor Luisa Ortega Diaz, a longtime loyalist who broke with the government over the issue.
The helicopter incident capped a volatile 24 hours that began with widespread looting in the coastal city of Maracay on Monday night and continued Tuesday when opposition lawmakers got into a heated scuffle with security forces assigned to protect the National Assembly.
At least 68 supermarkets, pharmacies and liquor stores were looted and several government offices burned following anti-government protests in Maracay, which is about a 90 minute drive from Caracas.
As Venezuela plunges further into political and economic ruin, the flight of its citizens is reaching levels unseen in its history. Experts believe nearly one-tenth of its population of now lives outside the country, including in Colombia. (June 22)
Maduro condemned the violence but with a stern warning to his opponents that’s likely to only further inflame an already tense situation.
“We will never surrender. And what we couldn’t accomplish through votes we will with weapons,” he said.
On Tuesday, opposition lawmakers got into fisticuffs with national guardsmen as they tried to enter the National Assembly. In a video circulating on social media, the commander of a national guard unit protecting the legislature aggressively shoved National Assembly President Julio Borges as he’s walking away from a heated discussion.
At nightfall, a few dozen people were still gathered inside the neoclassical building as pro-government supporters stood outside threatening violence.

Mrs. Trump has been attacked for being too beautiful, too cold, too exotic and too quiet. She’s been attacked for making her son Barron the number one priority in her life. She’s been ripped to shreds over her modeling career and her marriage.
She’s been ridiculed for taking up the cause of “cyber bullying” when her husband is perhaps the world’s most notable user of Twitter, if not for bullying than certainly for “needling.”

Ohio Carries Out Its First Execution Since 2014,"Continue reading the main storyShare This Page

An Ohio prisoner convicted of raping and murdering a toddler in Akron in 1993 was put to death on Wednesday morning, the state’s first execution in more than three years.
The execution of Ronald Phillips, who was 19 when he killed Sheila Marie Evans, his girlfriend’s 3-year-old daughter, came amid a legal dispute about the constitutionality of Ohio’s execution method. After previous delays, a federal appeals court allowed the execution to proceed, and the United States Supreme Court declined to intervene.
Mr. Phillips was pronounced dead at 10:43 a.m. at the state penitentiary near Lucasville, a prison spokeswoman said.
Mr. Phillips and two other death row inmates facing executions had challenged Ohio’s three-drug execution method, arguing that the inclusion of midazolam, which is intended to render prisoners unconscious and insensate to pain, was cruel and unusual punishment.

As supplies of execution drugs have grown more scarce, at least seven states have turned to midazolam, a powerful sedative that is widely available, but controversial when used in lethal injections.

In Oklahoma, the drug was used in an execution that state officials said was botched because of an improperly placed intravenous line. Death row defendants have challenged midazolam’s use in Arkansas and Alabama, but have had limited success in the courts. Arkansas used the drug to carry out four executions in April, just before its midazolam supply expired.

The drug’s use in Ohio has been particularly troubled. In January 2014, an Ohio inmate took an unusually long time to die, and some witnesses said the condemned man visibly struggled and gasped after the drug was administered.
Ohio has altered its execution protocol since then, but lawyers for Mr. Phillips and the other condemned men have argued that the procedure remains dangerous. A federal magistrate judge and a panel from the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati entered rulings this year delaying the executions, but were overruled by the full Sixth Circuit, which said the executions could proceed.
Mr. Phillips, who was convicted of aggravated murder, felonious sexual penetration and rape, has had three other execution dates since the state announced its drug protocol in October.

His lawyers have also argued that his age when he committed the crimes, 19, should preclude him from being executed. The lawyers, Timothy F. Sweeney and Lisa M. Lagos, said in a statement after the execution that Mr. Phillips was remorseful and that “we should thoughtfully reconsider our laws that permit the harshest punishment for those who committed their crimes as teenagers.”
Gov. John Kasich, a Republican who set the execution date, previously denied Mr. Phillips’s bid for clemency.
“Given the extremely brutal nature of the offense committed against an innocent 3-year-old child,” Mr. Kasich said in a statement last year, “I agree with the Ohio Parole Board’s recommendation that clemency is not warranted in this case.”
Mr. Phillips, 43, arrived at the so-called death house at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility on Tuesday morning, about 24 hours before the scheduled execution.
He was allowed to visit with clergy, family, friends and lawyers. For his final dinner, Mr. Phillips requested a large pizza with bell peppers and mushrooms, as well as strawberry cheesecake, Pepsi, grape juice and unleavened bread.

Topless protesters disrupt Woody Allen concert in Germany,"Berlin – Topless activists interrupted a concert by Woody Allen in Germany, calling for an end to the “culture of silence” around sexual abuse allegations against the US director.
The German branch of the feminist group Femen posted a video on its Facebook page showing two activists mounting the stage during an appearance by Allen, who plays the clarinet, with his New Orleans jazz ensemble late Tuesday in the northern port city of Hamburg.
Their bare torsos covered in writing attacking Allen, the demonstrators shouted a passage from an open letter by Allen’s adopted daughter Dylan Farrow published in The New York Times in 2014 outlining her father’s alleged abuse when she was seven years old.
“They reminded the world and the the jazz-loving audience that Allen is not just a neurotic and charming director, musician and actor” but also an abusive parent, Femen Germany wrote.
In the video, the crowd can be heard booing the protesters as Allen, 81, is seen asking a fellow musician on stage what the women were shouting in German.

Rex Tillerson (Finally) Goes On the Record,"Being America’s top diplomat means constantly being in the limelight, the nominal face of U.S. foreign policy around the globe. Some, like Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, embrace that side of things to excess, reveling in photo ops, glitzy press conferences, town halls, and interviews all over the the world.
But Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, unlike his boss Donald Trump or his Pentagon counterpart James Mattis, has largely shied away from the spotlight and back-and-forths with reporters — until now.
At the end of an eight day trip, Tillerson gave two State Department press pool reporters a rare 10-minute interview Thursday evening in which he talked about the Gulf crisis, the difficulties of his new job, and the jarring culture of shock of going from chief executive of an oil giant to diplomat-in-chief.
Qatar’s diplomatic showdown with its Gulf neighbors, which started in June, has ground down into an impasse. Tillerson, who traipsed through the Gulf this week to try to nudge the ball forward, was light on specifics wins he gained. “We tabled some documents with both sides while we were here which lays out some ways that we might move this forward,” he said.
For a quiet and behind-the-scenes secretary, the Gulf crisis is where he’s made the biggest splash in his first few months in office, talking almost daily to the Saudis, Emiratis, Bahrainis or Egyptians on the one side, Qataris on the other, and Kuwaitis in the middle; they’re leading mediation efforts. Tillerson’s been reticent to get out in front and lead mediation efforts; the administration appears to view this dispute as a Gulf “family matter.” Some critics say that, in large part, is why the Kuwaiti-led talks have stalled.
Tillerson conceded his trip didn’t resolve the crisis, but insisted the intangibles still count for a lot. “In my view there’s a changed sense of willingness to at least be open to talking to one another and that was not the case before I came,” he said.
Then he mused on his new job. In an unusually candid moment, he admitted how difficult it was to navigate the dense thicket of bureaucracy in Foggy Bottom. “It is a lot different than being CEO of Exxon because I was the ultimate decision-maker. That always makes life easier,” he said.
The massive, unwieldy U.S. foreign policy making machine is a far-cry from Exxon — a company simultaneously shrouded in secrecy but legendary in the energy industry for its hyper-efficiency and centralized hierarchy. “Those are not the characteristics of the United States government,” Tillerson said. “And I don’t stay that as a criticism, it’s just an observation of fact, it’s largely not a highly disciplined organization, decision-making is fragmented and sometimes people don’t want to take decisions, coordination is difficult through the interagency — has been for every administration,” he said.
“And you know in all honestly we have a president that doesn’t come from the political world either,” he said. Beyond Trump’s mercurial viewpoints and penchant for lobbing diplomatic bombshells out through Twitter, his administration has yet to fill key senior posts at the State Department. Career diplomats quietly lament this has kneecapped the day-to-day slog of U.S. foreign policymaking.
Tillerson’s thrown his own curveballs at the Department, pushing to slash its budget and overhaul its structure. It’s something many lawmakers and veteran diplomats say is long overdue. But his deliberative, behind-the-scenes approach, coupled with the glaring lack of senior lieutenants and Trump’s overall rejection of seven-odd decades of American engagement with the world, seems to have left the rank-and-file at State unmoored and disenchanted, as recent employee surveys show.
Lawmakers, even a small handful of Republicans, have sharply rebuked Tillerson.
“I’m tired, I’m tired, been a long trip, I bet you all are tired too,” Tillerson told the two reporters as he returned from his spate of shuttle diplomacy in the Gulf.
Still, he said his time as Exxon CEO prepared him well for running State. “In my old life, I spent a lot of time around the political world because I had to deal with governments all over the world so I’m quite, I’m quite comfortable in these settings,” he said.
“Engagement with the rest of the world is actually very easy for me.”",Foreign Policy,0
Company to implant microchips in its employees: ‘My microchip is now my credit card’,"Dave Urbanski 2 hours

This week, a Wisconsin company — Three Square Market in River Falls — is implanting microchips in the hands of more than 50 of its employees, KSTP-TV reported.
“It’s the next thing that’s inevitably going to happen, and we want to be a part of it,” CEO Todd Westby told KSTP, which noted Three Square Market is the first company in the U.S. to offer microchip implants to employees.
Image source: KSTP-TV video screenshot
The microchip — about the size of a grain of rice — is implanted between the thumb and index finger and will let employees get in the building’s front door, log on to their computers and pay for break room market items, the station said.
“My microchip is now my credit card,” Westby added to KSTP.
The company is picking up the $300 cost for each microchip — which the station noted are encrypted and secure — and getting an implant isn’t mandatory, the station reported.
As it happens, Three Square Market designs software for break room markets that often are found inside office complexes, KSTP said.
Westby demonstrated what a microchip purchase would look like.
“We’ll come up, scan the item. We’ll hit pay with a credit card, and it’s asking to swipe my proximity payment now. I’ll hold my hand up, just like the cellphone, and it will pay for my product,” he told the station as he stood next to a payment kiosk.
Image source: KSTP-TV video screenshot
A KSTP reporter asked Westby if the microchip can alert management if an employee is “slacking off” — but the boss said no and that “there’s no GPS tracking at all.”
Plus, the reporter added, if you no longer want the chip, you can “just pop it out.”",TheBlaze,1

Ohio lawmakers have legalized medical marijuana so when can you expect to see it?

CINCINNATI — Marijuana legalization advocate Cher Neufer queued up at a post office a month ago expecting to mail a T-shirt to a donor.
Instead, the card for her bank account was denied.
A few phone calls later, Neufer discovered that PNC had closed the account for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana's Ohio branch without notice, leaving all seven of its regional chapters without access to money.
Neufer, the organization's director, then approached five banks before finding a Wells Fargo (WFC) branch more than two hours from her hometown of Lodi, Ohio, that would accept NORML's business.
In June, PNC also closed the account of the Washington-based Marijuana Policy Project, another marijuana legalization advocacy group.
► December: Trump’s anti-pot attorney general choice rattles legal pot movement
► 2015: Some credit unions quietly extend services to pot biz
""PNC does not comment on customer accounts,"" said Diane Zappas, director of corporate reputation. “As a federally regulated financial institution, PNC complies with all applicable federal regulations.""
Neufer, who founded the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws' Ohio branch in 2001, said she thinks bank officials are afraid of running afoul of the federal government. Since the feds classify marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug, people in the cannabis industry cannot use banks without risking government seizure of their assets, even in states where medical and recreational cannabis use has been legalized.
“This is something coming from an understandable concern regarding the Trump administration and Attorney General Jeff Sessions' open hostility to marijuana.”
Justin Strekal, National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
""We understand that — that problem has existed for years — but not with a group that only educates and lobbies to change the laws,"" Neufer said. ""We are not a dispensary, and we do not take money from any of that.""
Ohio became the 25th state to legalize medical marijuana in June 2016, and 26 states plus the District of Columbia now have laws legalizing pot in some form. Ohio officials are in the midst of the rule-making process and expects to have medicinal pot sales begin in September 2018.
Recreational marijuana now is legal in eight states — Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Washington — and the District of Columbia.
While it's unusual for bank accounts for advocacy groups to be shut down, several new chapters of NORML have had difficulty getting banking services in states with and without legalized marijuana, National Political Director Justin Strekal said.
""This is something coming from an understandable concern regarding the Trump administration and Attorney General Jeff Sessions' open hostility to marijuana,"" he said.
It's unclear whether federal law really is forcing bankers' hands when it comes to the marijuana industry, said Taylor West, deputy director of the National Cannabis Industry Association. Medical and recreational use of marijuana still is illegal at the federal level, but federal regulators have not indicated they will pursue banks that serve state-regulated cannabis businesses.
""It's a dangerous precedent to for a bank to shut down someone's account just for the position they advocate,"" West said.
► 2014: Feds stockpile reports that could incriminate pot stores
► 2012: Cash business problematic for medical pot dispensaries
Strekal described NORML, a nonprofit 501(c)(4) organization, as the ""Ralph Nader"" of the marijuana industry. It often supports policies that run contrary to ""Big Marijuana's"" interests, such as lower barriers to entry that would increase competition.
""A lot of businesses won't give us money and very much don't like us,"" Strekal said.
The Marijuana Policy Project also was able to switch banks, Communications Manager Morgan Fox said. He wouldn't identify the lobbying group's new bank.

Why did 10 migrants die in this truck in Texas?,"Sunday 30 July 2017 02.00 EDTLast modified on Sunday 30 July 2017 17.00 EDT
One day earlier this month, Johny Serna was brought by his mother to pray the rosary at a parish shrine to Santo Toribio Romo, the patron saint of migrants, with his uncle and his best friend. They had a long journey ahead.
The next morning, the trio departed for the US-Mexico border, where they crossed the Rio Grande, finally climbing into a crowded 18-wheeler that would take them part of the way to their ultimate destination, Chicago.
The truck turned out to be a death trap.
Serna, 18, survived the scorching heat and asphyxiating conditions – as did his uncle. But 10 others died in a tragedy that exposed the perils of crossing the frontier illegally – and the callous indifference of the criminals who transport migrants.
About 30 more victims were hospitalised in San Antonio, where the truck and its grim cargo were discovered in a Walmart parking lot after a supermarket employee became suspicious and called police when one of the passengers asked him for water. As many as a hundred people from Mexico and Central America had been crammed inside.
At least 11 hailed from the small Mexican state of Aguascalientes, where young men head north to make enough money to better their lot in life back home. It’s a long established rite of passage for successive generations tired of scratching meagre livings from this region of dry highlands dotted with corn fields, guava groves and prickly pear cacti.
Unlike the migrants fleeing for their lives from Central America and violent corners of Mexico, those leaving Aguascalientes are drawn by the economic opportunities offered by the US.
Serna hated factory work and instead laboured in construction and picked guavas. He had a single goal: buying a house. “He wanted to earn more and live a little better,” said his cousin, Omar Romo Serna, a pudgy 18-year-old with a thin beard.
Aguascalientes, in the geographic heart of Mexico, is considered one of the country’s more prosperous states, but even here the lure of the US is irresistible to many.
Gabriel Hernández, the city manager in Palo Alto – an hour east of Calvillo and home to seven of the trailer victims – cites pay at home as the problem. He says migrants work long and hard hours in the US but don’t feel “exploited” like they do in Mexico, where shifts in factories are long and pay might amount to $85 (£65) a week.
Many migrants simply dream of buying their own homes. Walking the dusty but tidy streets of the town, Hernández –who spent nearly two decades in the US – points out the larger homes with brick facades mean “American money”. Shabby concrete structures with corrugated metal roofs suggest no access to US funds.
Adrián Lara Vega, 27, laboured as a bricklayer but couldn’t afford to move his family from a single room behind his parents’ home, among the chickens and pigs the Vegas raise to put food on the table. Relatives said he couldn’t find work for the three weeks prior to his departure.
“They didn’t leave here for ambition, to get the latest model car,” said Lara’s aunt, Rosalba Vega. “He wanted to feed his family.” Vega, who was injured in the trailer, was trying to reach Florida, where a cousin and other friends from Palo Alto were waiting.
Trump immigration plans risk more incidents like Texas deaths, experts say
Even Donald Trump’s migration crackdown and the rise of anti-migrant attitudes in the US is not enough to dissuade the town’s men from seeking better fortunes north of the border, said Patricia Briones, whose husband, José Rodríguez, perished in the truck. “He didn’t want to go to the United States,” she said. “But the economic situation is so dire here.”
Rodríguez, 38, lived in the US for 20 years, working construction jobs in North Carolina. Briones joined him and they raised five children – all US citizens – until Rodríguez was deported in 2016.
He was determined to return: he never readjusted to life in Palo Alto and couldn’t raise a family of five there.
“It’s sad,” Briones said at her parents’ home as her children, aged seven to 15, played with tops and fidget spinners. “José provided for the family. I don’t work outside the home and have to raise five children.”

It is 500 miles from Calvillo to Nuevo Laredo, the Mexican city that faces its Texas counterpart, Laredo, across the Rio Grande. According to a statement to US federal agents by a migrant from Aguascalientes who was to pay $5,500 for his trip, 28 people were taken over the river by raft at night in three groups.
He was told that people linked to the feared Zetas drug cartel would charge 11,000 pesos (£473) for protection and 1,500 pesos (£64) for use of the raft. The Zetas started providing security to Cuban migrants crossing Mexico around 2004, then expanded this obligatory protection service to other migrants crossing states they controlled.
The Zetas are responsible for some of Mexico’s most notorious migrant atrocities, including two massacres in 2010 and 2011 in which at least 265 migrants were kidnapped from buses, killed and buried in mass graves in the northern state of Tamaulipas.
However, the Zetas have never been directly involved in people smuggling, according to professor Rodolfo Casillas, an expert in migrant routes and criminal networks at the Latin American Social Science Institute (Flacso).
“Smuggling migrants is a specialist service, the Zetas don’t have the knowledge, experience or prestige in this business. That doesn’t mean the migrants didn’t have to pay them for security at some point,” he said.
“Criminal gangs don’t start and stop at borders – they operate through networks of accomplices which include transport companies and drivers,” said Erubiel Tirado, a security analyst. But he also said that it is not uncommon for other criminal groups to use the Zetas’ name to generate terror or to detract attention from themselves and confuse the authorities.
Once in Texas, the migrants walked for hours and were picked up the next morning and taken to the trailer, where they assembled with others, all waiting to depart in the evening.
Mexican laborer: we were told Texas ride that killed 10 would be air-conditioned
At about 9pm, a man appeared and handed pieces of coloured tape to the groups to distinguish them for the smugglers who would be collecting them later. Don’t worry, the man said: the truck has refrigeration, the trip will be fine.
But the cooling system was broken, and the container became an oven in the summer heat. The outdoor temperature reached a high of 38C (100F) and a low of 24C (75F) in San Antonio on 22 July, and the city is a two-and-a-half hour drive from Laredo.
Panic set in quickly, said Jonathan Ryan, executive director of Raices, a San Antonio-based immigrant legal aid organisation that is helping represent some of the survivors. Some cried, screamed and hammered on the walls. Others lost consciousness and hallucinated when they came round, believing they were dead.
The truck was from Iowa and driven by James Bradley, a 60-year-old with roots in Florida and Kentucky and a long criminal record. He is being held without bail and could face the death penalty.
According to the criminal complaint against him, Bradley “knew the trailer refrigeration system didn’t work and that the vent holes were probably clogged up”.
He told the authorities he was taken by surprise when he got out of the truck to urinate, heard banging and shaking in the trailer and was knocked over as people swarmed out when he opened the doors around midnight.
Some scattered into woodland to the west of the parking lot or were picked up by a half-dozen waiting SUVs. Bradley “noticed bodies just lying on the floor like meat”. Eight were dead and two would die later. But he did not call 911.
Migrants who have recovered from dehydration and other heat-related illnesses and are well enough to leave hospital are being detained by federal authorities.
Attorneys and advocates are seeking their release and gearing up to fight the possibility of deportation. “The survivors of this awful event are now being treated like criminals themselves,” Ryan said.
“I think right now the biggest aspect of their condition is they’re traumatised, they’re scared,” said Michael McCrum, an attorney representing 13 people being held as potential witnesses. He hopes they will be granted visas in return for helping law enforcement with their investigations. “I’ve already broached it with the prosecutors but it’s too early to have anything meaningful [decided],” he said.
It is one of the deadliest migrant-smuggling incidents in the US since May 2003, when 19 bodies were found in a milk truck abandoned at a truck stop in the Texas city of Victoria, 120 miles south-east of San Antonio. The first to die was a five-year-old boy who died in his father’s arms. The refrigeration system had been turned off.
Yet the dangers are not enough to end the flow of migrants, who continue to put their money and their lives in the hands of smuggling networks engaged in a form of hide-and-seek with federal officers along an increasingly militarised border.
Later on Sunday, on the same route from Laredo along interstate 35 taken by Bradley’s truck, agents at a Border Patrol checkpoint found 12 migrants from Honduras and Guatemala in a tractor-trailer. They were alive, but the temperature inside was 43C (109F).
The following day, shoppers filled their trolleys as usual in the Walmart, with its brightly lit aisles, vast array of goods and a long line of American flags draped from the ceiling.

BREAKING: Horrifying Discovery At Texas Border Will Make Your Blood Run Cold,"Mexico is a nation that’s long-gone to lawlessness, violence, and corruption. It’s so common that the people there no longer flinch when the most heinous crimes are committed. They just shrug it off as business-as-usual.
The Mexican Army just made a shocking discovery in the Mexican border town of Nuevo Laredo–a cartel-owned military arsenal containing machine guns, grenade launchers, and thousands of round of ammunition (via Breitbart).
Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, is a bastion for the infamous Los Zetas drug cartel. They pretty much run the place at this point. Police and government officials are in the pocket of the cartels–too scared or too crooked to take a stand.
The only progress made is the occasional victory by the Mexican military, which is slightly less prone to corruption than local police forces. It was the Mexican Army’s 8th military unit that unearthed this major stockpile in a town right across from Laredo, Texas.
While on patrol, Mexican soldiers saw a group of gunman hanging around the street. A chase ensued, leading the soldiers into a house where the cartel members managed to escape through a back door.
After inspecting the house, the soldiers realized they’d stumbled upon a jackpot. The place was filled to the brim with heavy duty weaponry. The Zetas have long been known as a paramilitary organization armed-to-the-teeth.
The confiscated stash consisted of one Russian-made RPG, five grenade launchers, three .50 caliber Barret rifles, two G3 H&K rifles, 13 .40mm grenades, and 91 rifles—including several AK-47s and AR-15s.
In addition, there were 20 military-style uniforms and an abundance of tactical gear among the arsenal. The confiscation of these weapons was a big win in the war against the cartels, but it also reveals just how powerful these criminal organizations are.
Nuevo Laredo has been home to major cartel violence in the last several years as factions within the Los Zetas gang battle one another for dominance. While there’s no tragedy in worthless thugs killing each other, these gang wars always result in the deaths of many innocent people, including women and children. These animals have no humanity.
What’s just as disgusting is the level of control that cartels like Los Zetas have over the Mexican government. South of the border truly is a gangster’s paradise, where law and order are a fantasy. If it weren’t for our border, these criminal enterprises would have free reign to carry out their lawlessness here in the US–just as they’ve been doing in Mexico for decades.
If Democrats had their way, we’d be living like Mexico right now. They see how dangerous these gangs are, yet give no thought to defending our border from them. The Dems want to invite Los Zetas in–no questions asked!
This is why we need a wall, as well as other tough border defense measures, and immigration control. If we don’t assert control over our border, it won’t be long before the US becomes a third-world landfill like Mexico.

The 12 baseless claims that form Russiagate,"Alexander Mercouris3 hours agoJuly 3, 2017 99
Examination of the evidence for every one of the 12 claims made about Russiagate shows that they are untrue.
As others have pointed out, June has been a cruel month for believers in Russiagate. I had previously expressed the view that it would collapse in early summer, ie. around now. Whilst that has turned out to be over-optimistic, the scandal is certainly sagging, what with the revelations from within CNN about the cynicism with which the scandal is being seen there.
I would add in passing that in Britain CNN revelations have been entirely unreported.
In any event, since the scandal looks to be sagging, and may be in the early stages of collapse, this seems to me a good moment to give a comprehensive overview of all the various claims which have made over the course of the scandal, and to see how they stack up. I will therefore deal here with them all, concentrating initially on the three which are by far the most important.
(1) The Russians hacked the DNC’s and John Podesta’s computers and stole the emails they found there
This is the original, central claim in the Russiagate scandal. Every other claim which has been made by its believers stems from it. Should it ever be proved to be untrue then all the theories which have abounded during the scandal, and all the claims of Russian meddling in the US Presidential election and of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign, will collapse.
Not surprisingly believers in the scandal therefore insist on the truth of this claim. To deny it, or to express skepticism about it, is to open oneself up to charges of being a Kremlin stooge or a Putin apologist or – worse still – an agent of the Russian government. Unsurprisingly no political figure in the US is prepared to risk that, with even Donald Trump – the only politician in the US who has ever publicly expressed doubts about this claim – saying nonetheless that he still “believes” it.
In reality the evidence for Russian hacking of the DNC’s and of John Podesta’s computers is extremely thin.
No agency of the US government has examined these computers. The only examination of the computers which has taken place, and the only investigation of the hacking allegation which has been carried out, has been the work of a private company – CrowdStrike – whose opinions the relevant US government agencies have simply accepted as true.
I have never come across such a situation before, where a police agency bases its conclusions not on its own investigations but entirely on the opinions of a private detective agency.
In this case what is even more troubling is that the DNC and John Podesta apparently specifically denied the relevant US investigative agency – the FBI – access to their computers. Moreover they were also CrowdStrike’s clients, whilst it seems that CrowdStrike’s owner Dmitri Alperovitch is a known Hillary Clinton supporter and a strong opponents of President Putin of Russia and his government. Given the obvious possibility of bias, that ought to have made the FBI even more careful before accepting CrowdStrike’s opinions as true.
In the event there has been strong criticism of CrowdStrike’s whole approach and methodology from within the IT community, with people like Jeffrey Carr and John McAfee ridiculing the way it has come to its conclusions.
I am not an IT specialist and I am not therefore in a position to comment or second guess this criticism. However essentially it boils down to (1) doubts that the two malware vehicles supposedly used to carry out the hacks – Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear – really have a connection to Russia (apparently they both originate in Ukraine); (2) claims that this malware has been around for a long time and is therefore available for use by any hacker, with no reason to connect its use to Russia; and (3) claims that it is anyway supremely easy for a hacker possessing even the most rudimentary skills to create a false trail purportedly linking his hack to Russia, so that no conclusions can be drawn from the appearance of such a trail.
To these claims I would add two points which I have myself made previously, which are
(1) that the assumption of a Russian connection to the hacks appears to rest heavily on the belief that the self-proclaimed hacker who calls himself “Guccifer 2.0” is not only Russian but is a front for Russian intelligence. However there is no evidence other than Guccifer 2.0’s own claims that directly links Guccifer 2.0 to the DNC and Podesta hacks, and the theory that Guccifer 2.0 is a front for Russian intelligence appears to me to depend far too much on the fact that he at some point referred to himself in computer language as “Felix Edmundovitch” – the first name and patronymic of F.E. Dzerzhinsky, the founder of the Cheka, Soviet Russia’s first security agency – which is actually so wildly improbable if he were really fronting for Russian intelligence, that in reality it almost certainly proves that the claim that Guccifer 2.0 is a front for Russian intelligence cannot be true; and
(2) that everything that is actually known about Russian intelligence suggests that its methods are far more sophisticated than those allegedly used to carry out the DNC and Podesta hacks. The crude methods used to carry out these hacks, using old malware apparently created in Ukraine more than a decade ago, point if anything to the hacks being carried out by someone else, most probably by private individuals.
Recently a further point has been made about the claim that it was the Russians who hacked the computers of John Podesta and the DNC. This point has been made by Daniel Lazare writing for Consortium News, and is a p0int which had never occurred to me, and which so far as I know no-one has made before.
This is that ultimately we only have the word of Hillary Clinton, the DNC, John Podesta and their paid contractor CrowdStrike that a hack took place at all. Since the DNC and John Podesta refused to allow the FBI to examine their computers, the FBI cannot itself verify that there was in fact such a hack.
This is a point of some importance, so I will set out Daniel Lazare’s comments on this point in full
….the problems with Russia-gate date back to the beginning. Where Watergate was about a real burglary, this one began with a cyber break-in that may or may not have occurred. In his June 8 testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey conceded that the FBI never checked the DNC’s servers to confirm that they had truly been hacked.
Former FBI Director James Comey
COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN RICHARD BURR: Did you ever have access to the actual hardware that was hacked? Or did you have to rely on a third party to provide you the data that they had collected?
COMEY: In the case of the DNC, and, I believe, the DCCC [i.e. the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee], but I’m sure the DNC, we did not have access to the devices themselves. We got relevant forensic information from a private party, a high-class entity, that had done the work. But we didn’t get direct access.
BURR: But no content?
BURR: Isn’t content an important part of the forensics from a counterintelligence standpoint?
COMEY: It is, although what was briefed to me by my folks — the people who were my folks at the time – is that they had gotten the information from the private party that they needed to understand the intrusion by the spring of 2016.
The FBI apparently was confident that it could rely on such “a high-class entity” as CrowdStrike to tell it what it needed to know. Yet neither the Democratic National Committee nor CrowdStrike, the Irvine, California, cyber-security firm the DNC hired, was remotely objective.
Hillary Clinton was on record calling Putin a “bully” whose goal was “to stymie, to confront, to undermine American power” while Dmitri Aperovitch, CrowdStrike’s chief technical officer, is a Russian émigré who is both anti-Putin personally and an associate of the Atlantic Council, a pro-Clinton/anti-Russian think tank that is funded by the Saudis, the United Arab Emirates and the Ukrainian World Congress. The Atlantic Council is one of the most anti-Russian voices in Washington.
So, an anti-Putin DNC hired an anti-Putin security specialist, who, to absolutely no one’s surprise, “immediately” determined that the break-in was the work of hackers “closely linked to the Russian government’s powerful and highly capable intelligence services.”
Comey’s trust in CrowdStrike was akin to cops trusting a private eye not only to investigate a murder, but to determine if it even occurred. Yet the mainstream media’s pack journalists saw no reason to question the FBI because doing so would not accord with an anti-Trump bias so pronounced that even journalism profs have begun to notice.
This is a blindingly obvious point, and I am astonished with myself for never having previously thought of it. Daniel Lazare is to be commended for being so far as I know the first to see it.
In summary, not only is the evidence that the Russians hacked the computers of John Podesta and the DNC extremely thin and, such as it is, fiercely contested, but it is dangerously dependent on the opinions of a paid private contractor with a known political bias, who is the paid contractor of the clients whose computer are alleged to have been hacked.
Moreover, in view of the failure of the US’s own investigative agencies to examine the actual evidence, there can be no certainty that the hacking of the DNC’s and John Podesta’s computers as alleged even took place, much less that the Russians were responsible for it.
In summary, the evidence for claim (1) is thin and fiercely contested, and whilst it would be wrong to say that there is no evidence for claim (1) at all, it is doubtful that such evidence as there is would satisfy a court, so that no great weight should be placed upon it.
(2) The Russians provided the emails they stole from the DNC and John Podesta to Wikileaks which published them on their behalf
Before discussing this claim, it is necessary to make two points.
Firstly, this claim depends wholly on claim (1), that the Russians hacked the computers of John Podesta and the DNC and stole the emails from them. If claim (1) is untrue – and as we have seen the evidence supporting claim (1) is extremely thin and fiercely contested – then claim (2) cannot be true.
It is a feature of conspiracy theories (which should not be confused with theories about possible actual conspiracies) that those who peddle them make a guess on one point, and then build upon that guess another guess drawing from the first guess. The result is an often outwardly impressive but in reality rickety structure susceptible to collapse at every point. Russiagate is a classic illustration of this.
Secondly, even if claim (1) is true, it does not follow that claim (2) is true. Conceivably the Russians might have hacked the computers of John Podesta and the DNC and might have stolen emails from there. However that does not prove that it was they who provided the emails which were published by Wikileaks.
It is a fundamental error to treat evidence for claim (1) as evidence for claim (2). In order to be sure that claim (2) is true there has to be actual evidence of contact between the Russians and Wikileaks, and in particular actual evidence that it was actually the Russians who provided the emails to Wikileaks.
We know that this evidence does not exist. The reason we know this is because former FBI Director James Comey, the person who was in overall charge of the Russiagate investigation until just a few weeks ago, has told us as much.
I have discussed all this previously here, and here is what Comey said in an exchange with Congressman Adam Schiff which makes the absence of that evidence clear
SCHIFF: Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks?
SCHIFF: Are you aware that Mr. Stone also claimed that he was in touch with an intermediary of Mr. Assange?
SCHIFF: This is a question I think you can answer. Do you know whether the Russian intelligence service has dealt directly with WikiLeaks or whether they too used an intermediary?
COMEY: We assessed they used some kind of cutout. They didn’t deal directly with WikiLeaks. In contrast to D.C. Leaks and Guccifer 2.0.
SCHIFF: In early October, are you aware that Mr. Stone tweeted I have total confidence that my hero, Julian Assange will educate the American people soon. Are you aware of that tweet?
COMEY: I’m back to my original same answer.
SCHIFF: And are you aware that it was only days later that WikiLeaks released the Podesta e-mails?
Comey’s words confirm that Russian intelligence was not in contact with Wikileaks and could not therefore have directly given the emails to Wikileaks.
Though it is clear from Comey’s words that neither he nor the FBI know who did give the emails to Wikileaks, he assumes – because he believes this was done by the Russians – that this was done through cutouts.
Julian Assange, Wikileaks, and ambassador Craig Murray – the latter by his own admission the contact between Wikileaks and the person or persons who actually provided the emails to Wikileaks – deny that the emails were provided to Wikileaks by the Russians. They say the emails were the result of leaks not hacks, and have hinted that the persons who provided them with the emails were disillusioned DNC staffers angered by the DNC’s bias in favour of Hillary Clinton and its ‘dirty tricks’ campaign against Bernie Sanders.
Julian Assange, Wikileaks and Craig Murray – whatever other views one has about them – are experienced people and consistent truth-tellers about their work. They are not naive people, and in Craig Murray’s case he is a former senior diplomat accustomed to working with intelligence agencies and who knows how they work.
There is no evidence that the people Wikileaks and Craig Murray dealt with were cutouts. Comey’s words show that the US does not know their identities (“we assessed – ie. guessed – that they were some kind of cutout”), and the theory these people were cutouts is therefore no more than a guess.
On the face of it it is highly unlikely that Julian Assange, Wikileaks or Craig Murray would have been deceived by cutouts, and since it is no more than a guess that the people who gave them the emails were cutouts, that theory can be discounted.
Independently of claim (1) there is therefore no evidence to support claim (2). Russian intelligence did not directly provide the stolen emails to Wikileaks. There is no evidence the people who did provide the emails to Wikileaks were cutouts, and it is in fact highly unlikely that they were.
(3) Wikileaks’ publication of the stolen emails was coordinated by the Russians and the Trump campaign
This is the central claim made in the Russiagate scandal, and is the primary focus of the Russiagate investigation previously carried out by the FBI and now carried out by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
Once again before looking at the evidence for this claim it is necessary to make two points, which are essentially the same points as those made in respect of claim (2).
Firstly, for claim (3) to be true, claims (1) and (2) must also be true. If the Russians did not hack the DNC’s and John Podesta’s computers, and if they did not provide the emails to Wikileaks, then they could not have coordinated the publication of the emails with the Trump campaign.
In fact, as we have seen, the evidence for claim (1) is thin and fiercely contested, and the evidence for claim (2) is non-existent, with claim (2) depending purely on what is no more than an almost certainly wrong guess.
Secondly, even if claims (1) and (2) are true, it does not follow that claim (3) is true, and such ‘evidence’ as is provided to ‘prove’ claims (1) and (2) is not evidence proving claim (3).
Conceivably the Russians might have hacked John Podesta’s and the DNC’s computers, and might through cutouts have provided the stolen emails to Wikileaks, without there being any collusion or cooperation between them and the Trump campaign.
Just as claim (2) must be proved independently of claim (1), so claim (3) must be proved independently of claims (1) and (2).
It is now clear that the entirety of the ‘evidence’ for claim (3) is the Trump Dossier.
I have previously explained why the account of the Russian decision making process set out in the Trump Dossier is totally absurd, and why this means that the account given in the Trump Dossier must be ultimately a fiction.
Over and above thism back in April The Russia Explainer did a comprehensive fact-check of every claim and allegation made in the Trump Dossier in a way that I have neither the time nor the knowledge to do.
The Russian Examiner found that those claims in the Trump Dossier which can be shown to be true were with one exception (see below) invariably reported earlier either by the Russian media or by the Western media, or derive from information already in the public domain. Moreover there are errors and misunderstandings in the Trump Dossier such as might be expected of a report sourced largely from the internet. Here is just one example, relating to certain claims in the Trump Dossier about the activities of Carter Page, who is a central character in the Trump Dossier, just as he has become in the Russiagate investigation
There’s a verifiable factual error in this paragraph. It’s a very subtle one, but it’s there. It says the meeting “took place on either 7 or 8 July, the same day or the one after Carter Page made a public speech to the Higher Economic School in Moscow.”
So reading that, it’s clear that Page made his speech to the Higher Economic School on July 7, and then July 8 was the day after, right?
No. For two reasons. First, Page was invited to Russia by the New Economic School, not the Higher School of Economics. They’re two different universities, and whichever one Steele was trying to refer to, he got the name wrong.
Secondly, Page gave speeches to the New Economic School on both July 7 and July 8. July 7 was a lecture called “The Evolution of the World Economy: Trends and Potential,” and July 8 was a commencement speech at the New Economic School’s graduation, where Carter Page’s speech was called “How to Increase Your Potential in Unstable Times.” According to journalists in attendance, the speeches sucked.
To make things more confusing, in 2014 Carter Page had been a guest lecturer at the Higher School of Economics. He gave a joint lecture on Feb. 27, 2014 with the two themes “Cooperative Approaches to the Political and Economic Development of Iraq” and “Measuring Preferential Polarization: Theory and Application,” together with his co-lecturer Ozdemir Ugur, a Turkish scholar who is currently a lecturer in quantitative political science at Edinburgh University.
I would add that confusion between Moscow’s New Economic School and Moscow’s Higher School of Economics is one which is very commonly made outside Russia, especially as both institutions were established the same year (1992). Both incidentally are widely seen in Russia as pro-Western liberal institutions, not at all the sort of places where someone alleged to be colluding with Russian intelligence to influence the outcome of a US Presidential election would be expected to give an anti-American speech.
However the most devastating point made by The Russia Explainer about the Trump Dossier is surely this one
A lot of the people who believe in the Steele dossier without corroboration (or hope against hope that it proves to be true) look at the points of intersection between stories in the media and the dossier’s reports as evidence of the truth of the dossier. I don’t see how the fact that the dossier includes information that had already been reported makes the dossier any more credible. If anything it hints at the likely method for preparing the “verified” parts of the dossier: Internet research by sources whose main qualification was that they could search in Russian.
If someone can show me anything in the Steele dossier that was reported in the media after the date of the Steele report in which it is mentioned, that’s something that should be seriously checked out. But if the media scooped Steele and he’s just reporting something that was already in the public domain, that’s really not impressive at all from an intelligence perspective.
(bold italics in the original)
As it happens The Russia Explainer has answered its own question by going through the Trump Dossier with a fine tooth-comb and has found nothing “in the Steele dossier that was reported in the media after the date of the Steele report in which it is mentioned” with the single exception of one story, for whose presence in the Dossier The Russia Explainer however provides a complete and fully satisfactory explanation
The report on the Alfa Group (yes, Steele spelled it wrong) is actually the only place in the whole dossier where the dossier was ahead of the mainstream news cycle. The report doesn’t give any context for why a special report on the relationship between Putin and Alfa was requested. But on Halloween 2016, the story broke that in Spring and Summer 2016, white-hat hackers had been tracking electronic communications between Trump’s e-mail server and an Alfa-Bank (part of Alfa Group) computer in Russia, posting their findings on Reddit – so it was in the public domain but you really had to be paying attention (as apparently a few New York Times journalists and probably the FBI were). I doubt that Steele or his sources were following hacker forums on Reddit.
So here’s what I think happened: by September, Steele’s ultimate client was the Democrats. Someone tipped off the Hillary Clinton campaign (and/or the Clinton-aligned group that was paying Fusion GPS / Orbis) about the electronic link to Alfa, and then Orbis (Steele) got a call asking for an intelligence report on Alfa Group’s connections to Putin, without saying why. However, since it was on the phone, the Orbis person heard it as “Alpha Group,” and their Russian sources didn’t correct the error.
As to the other claims made by the Trump Dossier, where verification is either impossible or very difficul, The Russia Examiner makes essentially the same as point as the one made by me, that the descriptions of high level meetings and secret discussion within the Russian government look to anyone with a genuine knowledge of Russia unlikely and fanciful, and simply don’t ring true.
However we can now go beyond these obvious doubts about the Trump Dossier and consider what US investigators themselves tell us.
As US officials and former officials in the know confirm – and we have now heard this said publicly by Comey, Clapper, Brennan, Nunes and Feinstein – despite 11 months of investigation bringing together the combined resources of the entire US intelligence and law enforcement community no evidence of collusion between Russian intelligence and any individual involved in the Trump campaign has come to light.
Every so often even the mainstream media admits as much. Possibly the most plaintive such admission was one made at the end of March by the BBC
Trump’s supporters are entitled to ask why – with the FBI’s powers to subpoena witnesses and threaten charges of obstructing justice – nothing damning has emerged.
Perhaps there is nothing to find. But some former senior officials say it is because of failings in the inquiry, of which more later…..
[one] reflected growing frustration with the inquiry among some who served in the Obama administration: “We used to call them the Feebs. They would make the simple cases, but never see, let alone understand and go after, the bigger picture.”
Before ending this discussion of claim (3), it is worth making one final point about the Trump Dossier.
The earliest entry in the Trump Dossier is dated 20th June 2016. Julian Assange first discussed Wikileaks’s pending publication of information about Hillary Clinton in a British ITV interview on 12th June 2016. The first entry in the Trump Dossier does not say that the Russians would help the Trump campaign by publishing information about Hillary Clinton they had obtained through cyber attacks. Instead it says the Russians would help Trump by feeding his campaign with secret information about Hillary Clinton that they had collected in a secret dossier they had about her. The first reference to Russian cyber attacks in the Trump Dossier appears in the second entry, which is dated 26th July 2016. This is four days after the first DNC emails were published on 22nd July 2016 by Wikileaks, and eight days after the hacker known as Guccifer 2.0 was referred to in a Fox news story as the source.
It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that on 20th June 2016 the creators of the Trump Dossier knew following Julian Assange’s interview of 12th June 2016 that publication of damaging information about Hillary Clinton was coming. However they had no idea what form this information would take. Accordingly they guessed wildly and as it turns out wrongly that it would take the form of information coming from a secret dossier the Russians had on Hillary Clinton. When the information however appeared and was publicly blamed on a cyber attack, they changed their story, no longer claiming the information came from a secret dossier but instead attributing it to a cyber attack.
Here therefore we have on the central issue of the whole Russiagate scandal evidence of the Trump Dossier’s creators taking their information not from high level sources within the Russian government but from the news media.
In summary, the ‘evidence’ for claim (3) derives from the Trump Dossier, whose account of the Russian decision making process is absurd, and which looks like a compilation based on media reports and occasionally faulty internet research spiced up with a heavy dose of invention.
US investigators have been unable to corroborate its claims for the simple reason that it is impossible to do so, since these claims are demonstrably and obviously untrue.
It turns out therefore that there is no evidence to support claim (3). Independently of claims (1) and (2), on careful examination the evidence for claim (3) collapses.
Claims (1) to (3) are the three central claims in the Russiagate scandal. To believe in the scandal it is necessary to believe that all three of these claims are true.
As it turns out the evidence for claim (1) is very thin and contentious, there is no evidence at all for claim (2), which is based on an almost certainly wrong guess, and the evidence for claim (3) – the Trump Dossier – does not stand up to examination, which is why the US’s investigative agencies have been unable to corroborate it.
Since in order for Russiagate to be true all three of these claims must be true, and since claim (1) may not be true, and since there is no evidence that claims (2) and (3) are true, the whole Russiagate scandal collapses.
Appendix 1 – Peripheral Claims
As invariably happens in scandals of this kind – particularly where there is no evidence to support them – all sorts of peripheral claims and micro-scandals crop up in their place. I will touch on them for completeness briefly here in a number of Appendices, though they do not alter or add to the conclusion, which following examination of the evidence of claims (1) to (3) has already been reached.
(4) the ‘real scandal’ is the corrupt financial relationship between Donald Trump and the Russians, which gives the Russians a ‘handle’ over him
The basis of this is claim is that Donald Trump’s business was supposedly bailed out by Russian money following a property crash and that this leaves him permanently in debt to the Russians, which somehow gives them a ‘handle’ over him.
This claim is regularly asserted, usually by people who don’t like Donald Trump but who are skeptical about Russiagate.
Unlike most of the claims which have been made in relation to Russiagate it contains a kernel of truth in that there is no doubt that Donald Trump has done business with Russian businessmen in the past. However there is no evidence that any of this was illegal or that it gives the Russian government – which should not be conflated with Russian businessmen – any sort of ‘handle’ over him. On the contrary such information as exists suggests no more than legal and ordinary business transactions.
(5) the DNC and Podesta leaks swung the election to Donald Trump
No polling evidence supports this claim and it is very unlikely to be true. Such evidence as there is suggests that Trump suffered more from the (unsubstantiated) claims that he was the Kremlin’s choice for President than Hillary Clinton did because of the revelations in the DNC and Podesta leaks.
(6) a vast Russian ‘fake news’ offensive swung the election to Donald Trump
This allegation was widespread last autumn following the election. It has looked increasingly threadbare since, as proof or even evidence of such a tidal wave of ‘fake news’ originating from Russia has failed to appear.
This claim is often combined with criticism of the election coverage provided by RT. However no evidence has been provided that RT’s election coverage was biased in Donald Trump’s favour, and no evidence at all has been provided that RT’s coverage influenced the outcome of the election at all.
It is in fact inherently extremely unlikely that American voters would prefer the election coverage of a Russian news source to that of one of their own, or that they would change their voting behaviour because of news or opinions they obtained from that news source, in anything like the sort of numbers such as would have made a material difference to the outcome of the election.
(7) the Russians hacked or intended to hack the voting machines but were deterred from doing so by US threats
The US government admits there was no hacking of the voting machines, either by the Russians or by anyone else. It has been suggested that the dispersed nature of these machines, with many of them apparently not connected to the internet, would actually have make such a hacking attack either impossible or at least extremely difficult.
As for the claim that the Russians intended to hack the voting machines but were deterred by US threats from doing so, belief in this ultimately derives from the belief of some US officials in claims (1) to (3). Since as we have seen claims (1) to (3) don’t stack up, there is no reason to give any credence to this claim either.
(8) all 17 US intelligence agencies support the claim that Russia meddled in the US election
Recent remarks by Clapper, Brannon and Comey have shown that this claim if not exactly untrue, is far from being fully true.
It seems that only a carefully selected group of analysts from three US intelligence agencies – the CIA, the FBI and the NSA – completed the January 2017 ODNI report, which is the report of Russian meddling in the election which being treated as the definitive account of that meddling by the US intelligence community. Of the four intelligence agencies which signed off the report – ODNI, the CIA, the FBI and the NSA – the NSA gave certain parts of the report only its qualified support.
Doubtless the other intelligence agencies do not actively dissent from the findings of this report, which has now become the orthodoxy. However they have avoided saying anything about it, which suggests that they are keeping their heads down.
(9) US intelligence agencies have independently of the Trump Dossier verified that there were contacts between members of the Trump campaign and Russian intelligence agents
The most incendiary form in which this claim was made was in an article which appeared in The New York Times on 14th February 2017 which was based on anonymous sources and which former FBI Director Comey says was in “the main wrong”.
This claim appears to derive from the activities of two individuals, Paul Manafort and Carter Page.
Paul Manafort’s contacts with Russian businessmen are widely known about. However they are historic and appear to predate his involvement in the Trump campaign. There is nothing to suggest that they had any bearing on the US election.
Carter Page, very unfairly, has been the focus of an inordinate amount of attention, and has even been the subject of a FISA warrant. However all his contacts with the Russians during the election were carried out in the open, and were perfectly legal and innocuous. Besides it is now clear that Carter Page anyway had only a very peripheral connection to the Donald Trump campaign, and that he did not represent either the Trump campaign or Donald Trump himself.
(10) Donald Trump’s closeness to Russia is shown by the fact that he removed from the Republican platform a demand for weapons to be supplied to Ukraine
Donald Trump never at any time during the election made any secret of his wish to improve the US’s relations with the Russia. As for the change in the Republican platform, that simply brought it into line with the existing policy of the Obama administration. There is no reason to look for any covert Russian involvement in this decision, and no evidence of such involvement exists.
Appendix 2 – the Flynn case
(11) The Flynn case is not properly speaking part of the Russiagate scandal at all, though it obviously derives from it. It stems from a single telephone conversation General Flynn had in December with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak on the same day that President Obama announced further sanctions against Russia.
Flynn is alleged to have violated the Logan Act during this call, and there are suggestions that he may be guilty of obstructing justice and may have made himself susceptible to blackmail by the Russians because he wrongly denied to Vice-President Pence and the FBI’s investigators that he had discussed Obama’s latest sanctions with Kislyak during the call.
These allegations are both cruel and absurd. No prosecution has been brought under the Logan Act in the two centuries of its existence. Nothing about the conversation Flynn had with Kislyak suggests it merits such a prosecution. Sources who have read the transcript of the conversation say that nothing Flynn said to Kislyak was at wrong or improper.
As for Flynn’s subsequent denial that he discussed Obama’s sanctions with Kislyak, the circumstances point to that being nothing more than a simple mistake.
In light of this allegations of obstruction of justice and exposure to blackmail are absurd, something also suggested by the fact that though more than half a year has passed since Flynn’s conversation with Kislyak no criminal charges in relation to it have been brought against him.
Appendix 3 – Obstruction of Justice
(12) This allegation stems from a conversation Trump had as President with Comey about Flynn, and from the tangled circumstances of Comey’s dismissal. Trump’s opponents say his conversation with Comey about Flynn amount to obstruction of the investigation the FBI was carrying out against Flynn in connection with his conversation in December with Russian ambassador Kislyak. They also say that the circumstances of Comey’s dismissal and the contents of certain conversations between Trump and Comey point to Trump seeking to obstruct the FBI’s investigation into the Russiagate allegations.
There is no doubt that Donald Trump wanted the FBI to drop its investigation of Flynn. However there is no evidence that he either ordered the FBI to drop the investigation or put any pressure on it to do so.
Trump did ask Comey to issue a public statement that he was not personally under investigation. Since that was true it was an entirely appropriate request for Donald Trump to make, and Comey was wrong to refuse it.
There is no evidence that Trump ordered Comey to drop the Russiagate investigation itself, or that he interfered in it in any way. On the contrary he made it clear to Comey that if any members of his campaign team were found to have done wrong then the law should take its course.
Trump did eventually sack Comey, and by his own admission dissatisfaction with Comey’s conduct of the Russiagate investigation played a part in this. However Comey had also by that time lost – though for different reasons – the support of the Justice Department, and his glacially slow conduct of the Russiagate investigation, his refusal to heed Trump’s call for an investigation of the numerous leaks which have been taking place during the Russiagate affair, and his refusal to publish the statement Trump wanted saying that Trump was not under investigation make Trump’s decision to sack him both excusable and understandable.
There is no evidence Trump took or sought to take any step once Comey was sacked to end or curtail the Russiagate investigation, which continues unimpeded to this day under the new leadership of Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
The facts therefore show that whilst Trump acted unwisely and even inappropriately in his interactions with Comey, no actual obstruction of justice took place, and this is now the prevailing view of the legal community of the US.
As I have said previously, the heart of the Russiagate scandal is contained in claims (1) to (3). The fact that they do not stack up is sufficient in itself to show that the entire scandal has no substance.
It turns out that none of the nine other spin-off claims made during the scandal have any substance to them either. It is not surprising therefore that the whole scandal is starting to sag.
I remain of the view that it is only a matter of time before the scandal collapses completely. Ultimately the claims which have made are so extreme that it will be impossible to justify the attention given to the scandal if serious criminal charges are not brought against some at least of the US citizens said to be involved in it. However the facts show that there is no factual basis for bringing such charges, and nor can there be. That all but guarantees the scandal’s eventual collapse.
Final word – not bigger than Watergate – bigger than Iraq’s WMD
One of the major untruths said about this scandal is that it is “bigger than Watergate”.
This is nonsense. Watergate began with an actual crime – the break in of the Democratic Party’s headquarters in the Watergate building by a team of burglars actually employed by the White House – and exposed a systematic campaign by the Nixon administration to obstruct the investigation of that crime, and (as it turned out) of numerous other crimes which had been committed.
The Russiagate scandal by contrast is a scandal about literally nothing. No actual crime has so far been detected apart from the alleged Russian hack of the computers of John Podesta and the DNC, an alleged crime which bizarrely the relevant police and investigative agency – the FBI – has not in fact investigated. No evidence has however been discovered of any wrongdoing by any US citizen.
The last time something similar on this scale happened was in 2002 to 2003, when Iraq was invaded on the strength of bogus claims also unsupported by any evidence that Iraq was in possession of secret stockpiles of WMD (‘weapons of mass destruction’).
That debacle seriously damaged the reputation of the US intelligence community. Russiagate however has the potential to do it far more damage.
Not only is it a wholly fictitious scandal like the one about Iraq’s non-existent stockpiles of WMD. Unlike the Iraq WMD scandal it is however an intelligence concerns the domestic political processes of the United States.
Moreover it has been conducted in a grossly partisan way by the US intelligence community in alliance with the Democratic party and the liberal media against a Republican President.
When the scandal collapses the President and the Republicans will be fully justified in feeling not just vindicated but also deeply aggrieved. Given the sort of people some of them are, it is a certainty they will be out for blood.
The sequel may turn out to be far more momentous than the scandal itself.",The Duran,1
Social Justice Warriors Say Mother’s Day Is ‘OFFENSIVE” – Want To Replace It With This Non-Gendered Holiday Instead…,"The destruction of the traditional families and values in American society has been slowly growing over the past few years.
In the past, Americans believed through hard work and educating their children, they would be rewarded, not just with a decent life but with the prospect that their kids would have a better life than them.
Somewhere along the line, society and social attitudes changed…liberals took over and the globablist views began flooding our insitutions and schools. Our children began learning about the acceptance of gays, lesbians and transgenders as normal. We even passed bathroom laws in states that permitted transgenders and males who ‘felt like women’ to enter female washrooms and girls’ locker rooms. We went from viewing the traditional family as a man and a woman, to a man and a man, and a woman and a woman. Then, you stop and ask yourself, where has all this taken us?
It’s taken us to a globalist society that wants Americans to believe that the ‘traditional’ family is actually the ‘abnormal’. Liberalists and globalists want Americans to believe that the traditional ‘parents’ or family aren’t the norm. Afterall, if they can get you to believe that the traditional family is not the ‘norm’, then they can also get you to believe that we should get rid of Mother’s Day and replace it with something that is more acceptable.
Of course the individuals that are dictating their standards on the rest of Americans make up less than 1% of society, but they want everyone else to submit to their views and their dysfunctional lifestyle. When it comes to traditional values or families, liberal socialists are trying to change society through the destruction of traditional families, and the acceptance of nontraditional values and families.
Emma Teitel on left, angry transgender parent on right
Columnist Emma Teitel who wrote her story in the Toronto Star about being a “transgender individual” is no doubt living and emotional roller-coaster ride which certainly affects both Teitel and those family members she’s left behind, namely her son, who perhaps has quite a few emotional issues of his own regarding “her” as “his” dad.
However, for the remaining 99% of the population, Teitel’s idea that “Mother’s Day” should be “gender-exclusionary” is simply a continuation of Teitel own personal emotional dilemma regarding “her” sexuality.
Teitel’s statement saying; “gendered holidays” are “generally a drag for non-binary parents who don’t identify with a single gender.” Is perhaps true, and once again that’s her dilemma, not societies.
Moreover, this is where Teitel becomes a typical progressive loon similar to those anarchists and rioting college thugs by actually suggesting getting rid of “Mother’s Day and Father’s day and stating with a straight face: “in the spirit of both inclusively and selfishness,” opting for a gender-neutral “Guardians Day.”
“A guardian can be a mom, a dad, a non-binary parent, a grandparent, an aunt, an uncle, a pet owner, or why the heck not—somebody who takes really good care of his houseplants,” she writes.
No doubt this poor soul lives in “her” own world of illusions, and several transgender individuals have written or posted video describing how the holiday can trigger feelings of guilt and confusion…and yet I can’t help but wonder those who don’t have the opportunity to speak out or write a column like Teitel, namely the sons and daughters, the wife’s and husbands of transgender individuals, and of their own emotional roller-coaster ride, confusion and guilt, they must also feel in not being able to celebrate “Mothers Day.”
In a YouTube clip, a transgender woman said Mother’s Day “can be a very hard day” as a parent, “I didn’t fit into either the mother or father category. … We’re in this weird kind of in-between space.”
Confused? We are too. Check it out:
Do you want this crazy .00001% of the extremist left population to just shut it and go away? No one in their right mind wants to disrespect mothers and get rid of Mothers Day.
Let us know what you think in the comments. Do you support getting rid of Mother’s Day and replacing it with ‘Guardian’s Day’?

Trump Embarrasses Ivanka With His New Campaign; Discredits Her Unpatriotic Merchandise,"July 16, 2017 Media, News, Politics
?>&url;=?>ℑ=?>?w=640"" target=""_blank"" class=""socicon-twitter twurl"">
By now, the White House has come up with too many random holidays and ‘week’ dedications to count. Usually, they have nothing to do with real issues that are happening. Probably to try and distract people from the mess that it’s becoming.
Sunday they announced a three-week messaging campaign promoting products made in the U.S. As reported by The Hill, this is an effort to push the Senate’s push to reform the tax code.
Subscribe to our Youtube Channel
It will be called the ‘Made In America’ week. Well, isn’t it pretty strange that Trump is hosting this especially when he and his family have most of their merchandise made outside of the country? Particularly, his daughter Ivanka Trump.
Her stuff can’t be included in this patriotic 3 weeks at all. As much as Trump likes to promote his daughter, I don’t think he thought this one out. In an extensive report by The Washington Post on Friday, It was revealed that most of Ivanka’s products, using clothing labels, traced her products to Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Despite the fact, the heiress does not disclose where her items are made. Hmmmm, we wonder why? Probably because people will see how much of a hypocrite she is.
Let’s not forget how Trump expressed how he wanted the foreigners to stop taking the jobs away from America. On inauguration day he flapped his gums saying,
“We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs,” he declared, adding: “We will follow two simple rules — buy American and hire American.”
Well, I guess that does not apply to his daughter. As a world leader, it is imperative that you practice what you preach. Why is it that you and your spawns feel as if you are above everything… even the rules you attempt to implement. No one believes liars. And no one believes a hypocrite. Trumps are NOT FIT for the White House.

Secretary Of State Comes To Blows With Trump Administration; All Hell Breaking Loose,"GooglePinterestDiggLinkedin Reddit Stumbleupon PrintDeliciousPocketTumblr
In the midst of Trump’s scandals and constant bickering with the media, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has been under the radar until recently, when he had a tense meeting with a White House aide after blowing up at different Trump administration official.
Subscribe to our Youtube Channel
As reported by Politico, Tillerson clashed with senior White House aide Stephen Miller last week over immigration issues, a topic Miller has been heading for the White House. During the exchange, Miller was pushing Tillerson to enact tougher policies on immigration and change State Department policies on the issue, but Tillerson made it “quite clear” that he wanted power over his own department.
This is not the first time Tillerson blew up Trump’s administration members. Tillerson also blew up at White House aide Johnny DeStefano last month over delays to appointments at the State Department and reports that Trump administration members were leaking negative information about the secretary of State to the media.
Trump’s White House is on the verge of destruction as Tillerson has grown increasingly frustrated with taking direction from younger Trump aides and not being able to implement State Department policies and offices–which is practically what he signed up to do when he took this position. It’s clear that Trump is agitating most of his administration with his ridiculous behavior and random outbursts. Soon, his swamp will drop like flies and Trump will be left with just Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer as his advocates–which in Trump’s case– isn’t a good thing.

Charlie Gard's parents end fight over treatment for their terminally ill son,"By Cleve R. Wootson Jr. and Griff Witte By Cleve R. Wootson Jr. and Griff Witte July 24 at 1:06 PM Follow @CleveWootson Follow @griffwitte
Charlie Gard's parents ended their legal fight over the terminally ill infant's treatment July 24. Here's what you need to know about the legal battle over his life. (Monica Akhtar,Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post)
LONDON — Charlie Gard's parents have decided to end their legal fight over the treatment of their terminally ill child. The months-long, emotionally charged case sparked a bioethical debate about end-of-life issues and captured the attention of world leaders, including Pope Francis and President Trump.
Attorney Grant Armstrong said the boy's parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, are withdrawing their appeal of court orders that say Charlie's treatment should end, according to the Associated Press.
Yates and Gard cried in court as their attorney said time had run out for their 11-month-old, after a U.S. doctor said it was too late to give the baby an experimental treatment on which the couple had pinned their hopes.
Outside the hospital where Charlie is being treated, his father gave an emotional statement, saying the family might never know what would have happened had Charlie been allowed to receive the experimental therapy earlier in his short life.
“Had Charlie been given the treatment sooner, he would have had the potential to be a normal, healthy little boy,” Chris Gard said, fighting back tears.
With Charlie’s mother standing by his side, Gard decried the “time wasted” by court battles and said that as a result of the delays and legal barriers, his son would not live to see his first birthday, on Aug 4.
“We will have to live with the what-ifs that will haunt us for the rest of our lives,” the father said.
Charlie has mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, a rare genetic condition that has robbed him of the ability to see, hear, move or breathe on his own.
He is at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital, alive only because a machine is helping him breathe. His doctors have concluded that nothing more can be done for him and that he should be taken off life support.
[Fallout from Charlie Gard case: protests, death threats and ‘disgraceful tide of hostilities’]
But his parents had been engaged in a court battle to have him undergo the experimental treatment in the United States, in the hope that it could help. They'd raised nearly $1.7 million to transport the boy to the United States if the court approved.

Other courts had sided with Charlie’s doctors, who said the experimental treatment was a fruitless endeavor that has not been tested on someone with Charlie’s specific condition.
Meanwhile, the hospital argued, Charlie has been in pain.
“If Charlie has had a relationship with the world around him since his best interests were determined, it has been one of suffering,” the hospital said in a statement read by attorney Katie Gollop.
But Charlie’s parents had garnered support from Trump, Francis and U.S. lawmakers.
If we can help little #CharlieGard, as per our friends in the U.K. and the Pope, we would be delighted to do so.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 3, 2017
To defend human life, above all when it is wounded by illness, is a duty of love that God entrusts to all.
— Pope Francis (@Pontifex) June 30, 2017
Protesters who wanted Charlie to receive the experimental treatment rallied outside the courthouse, including some who came from as far as the United States. Others have sent death threats to the hospital treating him.
“In recent weeks the community has been subjected to a shocking and disgraceful tide of hostility and disturbance,” the Great Ormond Street Hospital said in a statement.
“Staff have received abuse both in the street and online. Thousands of abusive messages have been sent to doctors and nurses whose life's work is to care for sick children.”
Protesters at Downing Street in London demanded the release of terminally ill infant Charlie Gard. The 10-month-old was due to be taken off life support June 30, but his doctors opted to postpone that action. (Associated Press)
Monday's decision drew expressions of commiseration and sorrow.
The Oxford-based Anscombe Bioethics Center, which uses Catholic teachings to analyze medical practice and research, said that “a time will come to look at what went wrong in this case” — but that that could wait for another day.
“Now is the time to remember the preciousness of the child at the heart of this case, and to allow his parents to be with him until he passes from this life,” the center said in a statement. “If further treatment may no longer be worthwhile, Charlie's life is inherently worthwhile.”
The hospital released a statement defending its decisions, while also commending the parents.
“The agony, desolation and bravery of their decision command GOSH’s utmost respect and humble all who work there,” the statement said. “While GOSH has striven to work with them throughout, Charlie’s needs have taken priority.”
Yates said she hoped her son's life wouldn't be in vain.
“We only wanted to give him a chance of life,” she said.
Gard and Yates said they plan to spend Charlie's final moments by his side in the hospital.
“We will let our son go and be with the angels,” Gard said.

Two-day strike against Maduro begins in Venezuela
Venezuela is running out of food. Hospitals are overcrowded with sick children while doctors don't have enough medicine or X-ray machines. Electricity isn't guaranteed.
About the only thing Venezuela has in abundance is chaos.
The economy has spiraled toward collapse, and a humanitarian crisis has plunged hordes into needless sickness and starvation.
The country is also in the grip of a political crisis. President Nicolas Maduro has called a referendum for Sunday that his critics say could erode the last vestiges of democracy.
It would allow him to rewrite the constitution and replace the National Assembly, which is controlled by the opposition, with an entirely new legislative body filled with his hand-picked nominees.
Venezuela was once the richest country in Latin America. Here's how it fell apart.
Venezuela's economy: 'It's at the point of no return'
Venezuela holds the world's largest supply of crude oil -- what once seemed like an endless gusher of cash. Now the government is running out of money, prices are soaring, and nobody knows how much worse it will get.
Venezuela was a powerhouse of South America in the 1990s. Former President Bill Clinton made it his first stop on a trip to the region in 1997.
But inequality grew extreme. A small elite class controlled everything while the increasingly impoverished masses fumed.
The country turned toward socialism in 1999 and elected Hugo Chavez president. He championed populism, cut ties with the United States and cozied up to China and Russia, both of which loaned Venezuela billions. Chavez ruled until his death in 2013, and is still seen today as a hero for the poor.
But his government far overspent on welfare programs, and it fixed prices for everything. It declared farmlands state property and then abandoned them, and instead made the nation dependent on selling its oil abroad.
Before he died, Chavez picked Maduro to succeed him, and Maduro kept up the regime's practices. His administration also stopped publishing any reliable statistics, including on economic growth and inflation. It accepted millions in bribes for construction projects and racked up debts that it is still struggling to pay.
Meanwhile, the only commodity Venezuela had left began to plunge in value.
In 2014, the price of oil was about $100 a barrel. Then several countries started to pump too much oil as previously inaccessible oil could be dredged up with new drilling technology. At the same time, businesses globally weren't buying more gasoline. Too much oil caused the global price to drop to $26 in 2016.
Today it hovers around $50, which means Venezuela's income has been cut in half.
With oil prices low and the government's cash dwindling, price controls have become a huge problem. The state still subsidizes food far below normal prices to appease the poor. Maduro has printed money at breakneck speed, and the bolivar has plunged in value, wiping out jobs and income.
At the same time, Maduro's hostility to foreign business has created a corporate exodus. Pepsi (PEP), General Motors (GM)and United (UAL) are just some of the companies that have cut back or left entirely. Unemployment in Venezuela this year could reach 25%, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Inflation is only getting worse. In 2010, one American dollar was worth about eight bolivars. Today it's worth over 8,000 bolivars, according to the unofficial exchange rate, which many Venezuelans use because government rates are considered far overvalued. Prices could rise an astounding 2,000% next year.
To keep up, Maduro has raised the minimum wage three times this year. That has provided a little short-term relief to the poor, but experts say it creates long-term pain in the form of a worthless currency.
""The economy is really chaotic. It's totally collapsed. It's at the point of no return,"" says Alberto Ramos, an economist who heads Latin America research at Goldman Sachs.
Maduro blames his opponents for Venezuela's economic woes and says U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan leaders are proof the United States is waging an ""economic war.""
Regardless of where the blame lies, humanitarian misery has followed the economic plunge.
You need this much cash to buy one bottle of water in Venezuela. That's 1200 bolívars -- worth about $1 a year ago. Today it's worth less than a penny. Inflation is expected to rise 720% this year and over 2,000% next, according to the IMF. Larger denominated bills are available but there's so much demand for them there's already shortages, forcing some to keep huge stacks of the old bills deemed worthless.
A post shared by Pat Gillespie (@patrick_gillespie) on Jul 24, 2017 at 7:23pm PDT
Children dying from lack of medicine, food in Venezuela
'There are people in Venezuela who are literally starving. This is apocalyptic stuff'
For several years, Maduro has had a stark choice: Pay down debts to China, Russia and foreign investors -- or buy food and medicine from abroad.
He has chosen to pay the bills. The result: Starving Venezuelans and soaring deaths in hospitals. Food shortages are so severe that the average Venezuelan living in extreme poverty lost 19 pounds last year, according to a national poll.
""There are people in Venezuela who are literally starving. This is apocalyptic stuff,"" says Eric Farnsworth, vice president at the Council of the Americas, a business organization. ""I would call Venezuela a failing state.""
Venezuela ships in food primarily from Brazil, Colombia and Mexico because the government stopped cultivating its rich farmland years ago.
For the first five months of this year, food exports from those countries to Venezuela were down 61% from the same period in 2015, according to Panjiva, a research firm.
Medical shortages are worse: 756 women died during and shortly after childbirth last year, a 76% increase from 2015, according to a rare release of government records that Maduro condemned.
Nearly 11,500 infants died in 2016, a 30% rise from the prior year. Malaria cases jumped to 240,000, a 76% rise from 2015.
""Even at the hospital there is still no food for the patients,"" says Dr. Huniades Urbina-Medina, head of pediatrics at Hospital de Niños J.M. de los Rios, a children's hospital in Caracas. ""We still don't have medicines, X-rays, CT scans -- nothing.""
It's not just food and medicine. Venezuelans sometimes must ration electricity and water during droughts.
The crises have literally pushed Venezuela's upper and middle classes out, creating a severe brain drain. Nearly 2 million Venezuelans have left the country since 1999, according to research by Tomas Paez, a sociology professor at the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas. Venezuela is a country of only 30 million people.
Venezuela's opposition claims victory
Political turmoil has brewed for years
It seemed like a potential political turning point in 2015 when opposition leaders won a majority of seats in the National Assembly, dealing a blow to Maduro. But gridlock was the result.
Early in 2016, Maduro stacked the Supreme Court with his supporters to block the National Assembly from impeaching him. Then, in March, the Supreme Court attempted to dissolve the National Assembly altogether, leading to months of protests that have left nearly 100 dead.
Sunday's vote brings the turmoil to a head. As Venezuela lurches into chaos, Maduro acts as if the opposite is true.
Last Thursday, he tweeted a video of himself driving through Caracas on streets tightly controlled by the police. On camera, Maduro insists the streets are safe, and that people are working and living ordinary lives.
But just a few miles away, off camera, young Venezuelans clashed with riot police as fires burned in the streets.

Disorganized White House Blamed for Delay in Sudan Sanctions Decision,"The White House announced this week it would put off any decision on Sudanese sanctions by an additional three months, a delay that former officials and Africa experts say reflects internal chaos inside the U.S. government.
“The [Trump] administration is still getting up to speed. There are no political appointees managing the Africa portfolio,” said Cameron Hudson, a former senior State Department and White House official. “They just don’t have the team in place to make that informed decision.”
Days before President Barack Obama left office in January, he signed an executive order that offered trade sanctions relief to Sudan and reversed two decades of U.S. policy meant to punish the country for terrorism and egregious human rights violations. The decision set a July 12 deadline on the incoming Donald Trump administration to determine whether or not to make the reversal permanent, a decision conditional on the Sudanese government in Khartoum making “sustained progress” in counterterrorism, humanitarian access, and ceasefire preservation, among other demands.
But this week, the Trump administration came face to face with the deadline before it had even appointed key Africa positions within the State Department and the White House, suddenly confronted with mounting pressure to make a controversial decision without input from qualified senior officials.
The lack of appointments within the administration prompted speculation within Africa circles in Washington that Trump would likely kick the can down the road and delay making his decision for at least another few months.
Despite a plethora of warning signs, Sudanese officials announced this week that they expected a permanent reversal from the Trump administration and were looking forward to further sanctions relief.
“As far as rational thinking goes, I am confident there is going to be a positive response,” Sudanese Ambassador to Washington Maowia Osman Khalid told   in a private meeting on Tuesday afternoon, adding that he believes his government had fulfilled the requirements laid out by the Obama administration.
Khalid, for his part, said that “no gaps in Trump’s administration should justify any negative outcome of not making the crucial decision of lifting sanctions from Sudan completely.”
Trump’s decision, which still offers Khartoum hope for a permanent reversal in October, is sure to come as a disappointment to the African country, which has been hit by Trump’s travel ban.
While Sudan “has made significant, substantial progress in many areas, the Administration has decided that some more time is needed for this review,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement released Tuesday night.
Foreign Minister Ibrahim Ghandour said on Wednesday that his government “regret[s] the issuing of this decision, which came after a long period of dialogue and interaction with the U.S.”
But it does not come as a surprise to Sudan watchers, who were aware that delayed appointments and disorganization within the Trump administration added to uncertainty about the looming decision.
One analyst who has worked on Sudan during both Democratic and Republican administrations said that within the Trump administration, “low to mid-level people are carrying on the best they can with no one above them giving direction to them.”
“There is no special envoy, no assistant secretary of state, and no one in the White House,” he said.
Another American privy to conversations surrounding the pending decision said that the lack of personnel made the timeline set by Obama administration unworkable.
“More than anything, I think this is a bureaucratic delay,” he said. “We understand it’s a very unorganized White House. It’s not just the Africa people who aren’t in place but many others, and that’s the bottom line.”
Opposition on Capitol Hill to rolling back sanctions also seemed to reinforce the likelihood Trump would delay his decision. Last week, a bipartisan group of 53 lawmakers penned a letter to the president requesting that he delay the decision “for one year or until your Administration has been able to fully staff the Department of State and National Security Council, and you have named a Special Envoy for Sudan and South Sudan.”
The special envoy position, like many other senior administration posts, still sits empty six months into Trump’s term.
But a senior administration official involved in the process insisted that had nothing to do with the White House’s decision to delay. “I would not draw any other conclusions based on staffing right now,” the official said Wednesday on a background call to reporters.
Washington is also pressuring Khartoum to cut ties to North Korea in its global push to ratchet up pressure on the Hermit Kingdom. The U.N. accused Sudan of conducting arms deals with Pyongyang earlier this year. That’s a “continual concern we have with the Sudanese government and we’ve expressed that all along,” the senior administration official said.
A wide cast of characters critical of Sudan’s human rights record, ranging from actor George Clooney to conservative Christian groups, may have also contributed to the delay. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir’s has been accused of war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity. The International Criminal Court put out its first warrant for his arrest in 2009, but he has thus far evaded detention.
The Obama administration relief rolled back some, but not all U.S. sanctions on Sudan. Khartoum still faces heavy legislative sanctions and sanctions related to being classified by the United States as an official state sponsor of terrorism. The executive order also doesn’t touch debt relief, which could be a key point of leverage over Khartoum in future negotiations.
Sudan is saddled with some $40 billion in debt, crippling an already anemic national economy. “The number one thing they want is debt relief,” Hudson said. “It’s not like the government of Sudan is completely off the hook if this goes through.”",Foreign Policy,0

WARSAW — President Trump's return to Europe this week was supposed to focus on resolving many of the lingering issues from his first trip there in May, when he exposed rifts with key allies over defense spending, trade and climate change.
But North Korea's July 4 missile test has put the rogue regime at the forefront of the annual meeting of the Group of 20 largest economies, where the major players in the escalating crisis will be represented: the United States, Russia, China, Japan and South Korea.
As Trump departed for Warsaw Wednesday, he tweeted at China, spoke to world leaders aboard Air Force One and prepared for a special meeting of the G-20 in Hamburg Thursday night to discuss security on the Korean peninsula.
""Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter. So much for China working with us — but we had to give it a try!"" Trump tweeted Wednesday before leaving for a four-day trip to Poland and Germany.
After a warm Mar-a-Lago summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in April, Trump has alternated between imploring China to take action – and seemingly giving up on his strategy to apply pressure on North Korea through its largest trading partner. ""Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!"" Trump tweeted Monday after the North Korean missile test.
It's difficult to discern whether Trump's North Korea policy is changing 140 characters at a time, but Harry Kazianis of The Center for the National Interest, a Washington-based think tank founded by President Nixon, said the tweets are intended to send a ""strategic signal"" to China.
During the Cold War, nuclear powers would demonstrate their resolve by lining up bombers on the runway, or opening and closing the doors to nuclear missile silos, he said. Trump uses a smartphone.
""This is Trumpian-style signaling to the Chinese,"" Kazianis said. The message: Trump's conciliatory posture toward China on trade and other issues may be coming to an end.
While Trump took a hard line on China during the presidential campaign, pledging repeatedly to label China a currency manipulator, he reversed course after his meeting with Xi in April in apparent hopes the Chinese leader would help curb Pyongyang's missile buildup. “Why would I call China a currency manipulator when they are working with us on the North Korean problem?” Trump tweeted in April. “We will see what happens.”
As Trump's tweets on China have grown tougher, so have the actions taken by the administration.
In the past week, the Trump administration has imposed secondary sanctions on Chinese entities doing business with North Korea, ordered U.S. ships through a South China Sea passage claimed by China, and approved a $1.4 billion arms sale to the Taiwan, which China views as a renegade province.
Meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow ahead of the G-20 summit, Xi said only that the Korean situation was ""complicated"" and that ""the present world is disquieting."" But he signed on to a joint statement seeking a negotiated solution that would link a nuclear freeze by North Korea with a halt to joint military exercises by the U.S. and South Korea.
The U.S. has rejected that condition, and engaged in a test missile launch of its own with South Korea.
And in a joint statement, U.S. and South Korean commanders noted that the Korean War technically never ended. ""Self restraint, which is a choice, is all that separates armistice and war,"" said the statement from U.S. Gen. Vincent K. Brooks and South Korean Gen. Lee Sun Jin. ""As the combined live fire demonstrated, we may make resolute decisions any time, if the alliance commanders-in-chief order. Whoever thinks differently is making a serious misjudgment.”
The Trump administration is also ramping up diplomatic pressure. ""Any country that hosts North Korean guest workers, provides any economic or military benefits, or fails to fully implement U.N. Security Council resolutions is aiding and abetting a dangerous regime,"" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Tuesday.
""Any country"" would include China. U.N. human rights investigators say North Korea has exported more than 50,000 workers to countries throughout the world, taking the lion's share of their pay to provide much-needed foreign currency for the regime.
China and Russia are the most common destinations for North Korean guest workers, but they're also used for hard labor in places like Qatar, the Persian Gulf country on a building spree for the 2022 World Cup.
Trump called Eqyptian President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi from Air Force One Wednesday to discuss Qatar's dispute with its Arab neighbors and also North Korea, calling on all countries to ""stop hosting North Korean guest workers.""
Egypt holds one of the 10 rotating seats on the U.N. Security Council, and the United States called for an emergency meeting of the council Wednesday to discuss new measures to apply pressure to North Korea.
Seven members of the G-20 also hold seats on the Security Council, including five permanent members.

"House Dems’ IT Administrator A Charming, ‘Cunning’ Con Artist, Associates Say","July 17, 2017July 17, 2017 Christopher Kemmett 0 Comments
House IT guys suspected in a security breach film their father sign a document later involved in fraud allegations / Fairfax County Court lawsuit evidence
A Pakistani-born House IT administrator suspected of misusing access to congressional files is a charming, dishonest manipulator with an unquenchable thirst for money, a dozen people who know him personally said in interviews with The Daily Caller News Foundation’s Investigative Group.
Relatives said that Imran Awan had such a penchant for taking advantage of people that his stepmother called the police and accused him of extortion, while his father changed his last name so he wouldn’t share it with his son.
Awan had full access to the emails and files of dozens of members of Congress, and is the target of a Capitol Police criminal investigation into, as Politico described it, “committing serious, potentially illegal, violations on the House IT network.”
However, members of Congress have not treated the situation as a potential security breach, instead saying that they trust Imran and do not think he would sell their data or use it for nefarious purposes like blackmail.
Among almost every person interviewed by TheDCNF, those who know him — including close relatives — described Imran as a savvy person and a calculating tactician who had tried to scam them.
In one example of that, he filmed a bizarre video — viewable below — of his father signing a financial document that he correctly anticipated would become subject of fraud allegations. He flaunted his supposed power in government, many said.
“He’s a very charming guy, charismatic, you’d like him,” said one person who rents a house from Imran. “He’s brilliant, knowledgeable about everything.” The family owns multiple real estate assets, but renters said Imran wanted rental payments in cash.
Congress paid him and family members $4 million between 2009 and 2016. His younger brothers, Abid and Jamal, and his wife Hina appeared on the House payroll at chief-of-staff level salaries, even as Imran brought in additional income in other ways.
Politico described Democratic Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida and Gregory Meeks of New York as having a “friendly personal relationship” with Imran and his wife. Meeks said he saw no evidence of anything “nefarious,” and Wasserman Schultz refused to fire him even though the House Sergeant-at-Arms has banned him from the network.
“Imran is very cunning and shady,” said Cristal Perpignan, a federal manager who rented a house from Imran, and who had repeated run-ins with him over money. “He gives you a sob story and you believe him.” Imran told her and other renters that his name was Alec.
Imran manipulated a high school buddy, Haseeb Rana, by having him do the work of Imran’s relatives — who fellow IT guys said were rarely seen — while earning less money than them, Haseeb’s father Tanwir said.
Imran is outgoing and relishes displays of power and influence. “My son is quiet, Imran is the opposite of that. He has pictures of him shaking hands with all the officials,” Rana said.
In addition to prominently displaying pictures of him with high officials, including former President Bill Clinton, “he had a huge picture of Mecca on the wall” of his home, one acquaintance said.
But the Awan brothers are said to be not particularly religious. “If they were real Muslims, they wouldn’t treat people like this,” a relative said. Abid Awan has had repeated arrests for alcohol-related offenses.
Acquaintances described a confidence that turned into boldness. “They’re obviously brazen,” a renter said. Fellow IT workers said that the sheer number of congressional offices that eventually added them to their payroll seemed suspicious, as if the brothers didn’t know when to stop.
In a Capitol Hill culture in which staff keep their heads down, Imran made sure to tell people to whom he owed money or wanted to collect money from that he worked for the “U.S. House of Representatives,” according to court documents and interviews. His home displays a massive blue congressional seal on a first-floor window.
Court records and interviews indicate that Imran controlled the money in his family as a pooled asset.
While employed by the House, the brothers — with Imran in charge — also ran a car dealership that received $100,000 from an Iraqi politician wanted by the U.S. government, a business partner, Nasir Khattak, said in court.
The dealership’s financial books had “very bad record-keeping” and “no documentation” where “it is close to impossible to make any sense of all the transactions,” Khattak testified.
When the company racked up debts, Abid filed bankruptcy to discharge them, leaving Imran’s assets intact.
Ownership of houses was transferred between family members in unusual ways, and Imran represented himself as the owner of houses that, on paper, were owned by others, potentially making it harder for law enforcement to seize assets.
The Awan brothers’ mother died in a car crash in Pakistan, and a business associate described Imran as having “raised” his youngest brother Jamal.
Their father despised his sons’ behavior so strongly he changed his last name to Shah — his son-in-law’s surname — according to court records and relatives.
The brothers’ stepmother, Samina Gilani, said in court documents that her husband was angry, in part because they had stolen disability checks from him. On their father’s deathbed, however, the brothers convinced him to let them steward his assets, perhaps in part because his second wife did not speak English or drive motor vehicles.
Days before he died on Jan. 16, 2017, their father agreed to transfer management of his life insurance policy to Abid, and the brothers recorded a video of him signing it. That change did not remove Gilani as beneficiary.
Around that time, Gilani called Fairfax County, Va., police. “Imran Awan threatened that he is very powerful and if I ever call the police again, [he] will … kidnap my family members back in Pakistan,” she later claimed in court documents. She said the brothers were forcing her to sign a different document giving them access to family money in Pakistan.
Coincidentally, shortly thereafter, House officials told congressmen in February 2017 that the family was the subject of a criminal investigation involving abusing their congressional posts.
Despite the apparent nepotism and high salaries the Awans were paid, the normally confident Imran was stunned. “He was a very different person… If he killed himself, I wouldn’t be surprised,” a renter said.
Yet despite the official attention on them, the brothers insisted on taking the $50,000 life insurance money by removing their father’s second wife as beneficiary after his death, triggering a court case to sort out the rightful recipient. They also kicked Gilani out of her home, even though they owned numerous other houses.
A judge said it was unusual that the brothers moved so quickly for the money as their stepmom was mourning the father’s death. Their lawyer, James Bacon, said they needed the money but offered no explanation regarding why.
Gilani’s lawyer, Michael Hadeed, said that the brothers committed insurance fraud. Their desire for an extra $50,000 on top of the millions from Congress could have unintended side effects as it relates to the congressional probe. Because of the lawsuit, “we can go forward with discovery” to get detailed information about their finances, Hadeed said.

Pro-Trump Pundits Sour On Sessions,"Some of President Trump’s strongest supporters in the media have lost faith in Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
Trump tore into Sessions in an interview with The New York Times Wednesday, expressing regret for choosing him as attorney general. The White House said on Thursday that Trump still has confidence in Sessions, but noted that firing Sessions would be within Trump’s authority as president.
While the White House claims that Trump has confidence in Sessions, some of the loudest pro-Trump voices are openly turning on Sessions.
“I know that Sessions does not have the confidence of the President. He should resign,” longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone told a Washingtonian writer on Wednesday.
“Trump should fire Sessions and appoint [Texas Sen. Ted] Cruz Attorney General,” said GotNews writer Chuck Johnson in a Facebook post Thursday morning. “Cruz is pro-Constitution and an order of magnitude smarter than Sessions.”
Right-wing blogger Mike Cernovich, whose work Donald Trump Jr. has publicly praised, blasted Sessions as “out of touch,” adding that the attorney general “has to go.”
New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin was calling on Trump to fire Sessions even before the NYT interview.
“Instead of firing the special counsel, which would serve as a rallying cry to the left and alienate some Republicans, Trump should wage a smart campaign to fight Mueller,” Goodwin wrote on Monday. “He can begin by firing two other people — Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein.”

Fox News host Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh stopped short of saying Sessions should resign or be fired but both of them, like Trump, appear to have soured on Sessions.
Hannity criticized Sessions on his radio show Wednesday for not reopening the investigation into former secretary of state Hillary Clinton’s email server.
“I don’t know where Jeff Sessions is, maybe something’s happening that we don’t know about,” Hannity said. He added: “I’m like, OK, we have a new attorney general, statute of limitations have not gone anywhere, why isn’t this woman being investigated?”
Radio host Rush Limbaugh similarly appeared to side with Trump over Sessions on Thursday.
“And this recusal just blindsided [Trump]. I’ll tell you why. I think Trump believed, since Sessions was so willing in the Senate to go against amnesty and to go against comprehensive immigration reform, I am convinced that Trump thought that Sessions was a fighter just like Trump sees himself. And then when Sessions recused, Trump was surprised,” Limbaugh said.
“And if I were in Trump’s shoes I would be so livid about [the Russia investigation] I wouldn’t be able to contain myself the way he is. It is that absurd,” Limbaugh added. “This is totally ridiculous.”

Trump Officially Nominates Successor To Comey As FBI Director!,"Back in May, Donald Trump fired the Director of the FBI, James Comey. On Monday Trump formally nominated Christopher Wray to succeed James Comey, as the new Director of the FBI. If the nomination is confirmed by the Senate, Wray would serve a 10-year term as the new director.
President Trump stated earlier this month about Wray’s nomination,
“I am proud to announce Christopher as my choice as the Director of the FBI. During his previous service at the Department of Justice, Christopher was the leader of major fraud investigations, and was a key part of the team overseeing the Justice Department’s actions in the war on terrorism following the 9/11 attacks.”
“He is an impeccably qualified individual, and I know that he will again serve his country as a fierce guardian of the law and model of integrity once the Senate confirms him to lead the FBI,” Trump said.
Wray, 50, led the Justice Department’s Criminal Division from 2003 to 2005, and is currently an private attorney.
“I am honored and humbled to be nominated by the president to lead the FBI, the premier law enforcement organization in the world,” Wray said in a statement.
“From my earliest days working with agents as a line prosecutor to my time working with them at the Department of Justice in the aftermath of 9/11, I have been inspired by the men and women of the FBI – inspired by their professionalism, integrity, courage, and sacrifice for the public,” he said.
“If confirmed, it will be a privilege and honor to once again work with them. America faces grave threats both here and abroad, and the FBI, in concert with its federal, state, and local partners continues to work steadfastly to prevent and hold accountable those responsible for these threats. I look forward to the confirmation process, and pledge my complete commitment to fairly and honorably protecting our country and upholding our Constitution and laws,” he added.
Of course, most Americans knew this was coming from Trump’s tweet back on June 7th:
Chris Wray, who served as assistant attorney general from 2003 to 2005, was interviewed for the vacant FBI director job by President Trump on May 30, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said at a press briefing. Wray worked under Comey at the Justice Department for two years, when Comey was the deputy attorney general.
Facts about Christopher Wray
In 1997, Christopher Wray began his career in government with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia, where he was an assistant U.S. Attorney. He was moved to “Main Justice” in 2001, serving as associate deputy attorney general and principal associate deputy attorney general, according to the Justice Department’s website.
President George W. Bush nominated him as assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division in 2003. He received unanimous confirmation from the Senate.
Wray worked alongside James Comey and former FBI director Robert Mueller at the Justice Department during his time in the Bush administration. Mueller was chosen in May to serve as special counsel for the Justice Department’s investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election.
While Wray was assistant attorney general from 2003 to 2005, Comey was the deputy attorney general and Mueller was leading the FBI as its director.
He was willing to resign along with Comey and Mueller in 2004, during Comey’s showdown with the White House over the plan to renew the National Security Agency’s Terrorist Surveillance Program while then-Attorney General John Ashcroft was hospitalized.
Wray has been a litigation partner at King & Spalding Law firm
Christopher Wray, 50, has been a litigation partner at the King & Spalding law firm, working out of its Atlanta and Washington D.C. offices, since he left the Justice Department in 2005, according to the firm’s website.
“Chris Wray is one of the nation’s top litigators and understands the prosecution of white collar crime extremely well. We are proud to welcome him back to King & Spalding,” said Walter W. Driver, Jr., King & Spalding’s chairman in a press release at the time.
“As head of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Criminal Division, Chris has been in charge of investigations, prosecutions and policy development in virtually all areas of federal criminal law — from fraud and public corruption to terrorism, money laundering, computer crime and appellate litigation. He has the will and experience to effectively drive the continued growth of our special matters practice, and our clients will benefit greatly from the experience he has gathered while at the Justice Department.”
Mr. Wray’s group, the King & Spalding Special Matters and Government Investigations Practice Group, has been named the “White-Collar Group of the Year” by Law360 and was called “the premier firm in this practice area” by U.S. News & World Report, according to the firm.
He is considered one of the top litigators in white-collar crime and government investigations, according to several publications.
Chambers USA called him a “renowned heavy hitter in this space” and a “top-notch advocate who can provide counsel on the toughest issues,” who “brings instant credibility and will give you straight answers without blowing smoke.”
Chris Christie’s Personal Attorney During the Bridgegate Investigation.
Christopher Wray served as the personal attorney to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie during the “Bridgegate” controversy, an investigation into the closure of lanes on the George Washington Bridge as political payback against a local politician, according to ABC News. Three of Christie’s top aides were found guilty of federal crimes, but Christie was cleared of criminal charges.
Christie praised Trump’s decision to nominate Wray:
“I have the utmost confidence in Chris. He’s an outstanding lawyer. He has absolute integrity and honesty, and I think that the president certainly would not be making a mistake if he asked Chris Wray to be FBI director,” Christie told the Asbury Park Press after the nomination was announced. He would not comment about whether he had any role in the president’s decision to consider Wray, according to the newspaper.
Wray Graduated From Yale Law School
Wray graduated from Yale University in 1989 and went on to Yale Law School, receiving his law degree in 1992, according to his law firm’s website. He was the executive editor of the Yale Law Journal.
After law school, Wray spent one year as clerk to Judge J. Michael Luttig of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.
Wray attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. His father, Cecil Wray, was an partner at the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton and his mother, Gilda Wray worked for the Charles Hayden Foundation.
He is married, to Helen Wray, with two children, a daughter, Caroline, 22, and a son, Trip, 20, and lives in Georgia.",Ihavethetruth,1
How the ‘Center’ Is Spinning Apart,"There’s the old warning that at times the “center cannot hold,” but today’s “center” appears to be self-destructing, creating unnecessary crises and conflicts that worsen the world’s predicament, notes ex-British diplomat Alastair Crooke.
That “icon” of the “centrists,” Facebook, recently wrote to a site on the U.S. “Alt-Right” telling them that various posts which they had authored must be immediately taken down, or would be deleted. The references which had offended were the words ‘trannies” for transgenders and “cross-dressers.” The message from Facebook further suggested that gender “identity” is considered a “protected characteristic” (under the law – which it is not), and that reference to transgenders as “trannies” could be considered “hate speech” (i.e. a legal offence).

A totally trivial issue, in itself, except that it goes to the heart of the disputed vision which encapsulates the present U.S. civil stand-off: On the one side, the notion that diversity, freely elected sexual orientation, and identity rights, equals societal cohesion and strength. Or, on the other hand, the vision encapsulated by Pat Buchanan: that a nation (including its new-comers) are bound more by the possession of a legacy of memories, a heritage of manners, customs and culture, and an attachment to a certain “way-of-being,” and principles of government. And it is this that constitutes the source of a nation’s strength.
The point here, is that the “centrist” center visibly is folding. The insistence to manage and control discourse (per Michel Foucault), around a strictly de-limited, political ideology is drawing now public disdain (and street demonstrations in the U.S.) targeted both at social media, and at elements of the MSM (mainstream media outlets, such as CNN). That is to say, the more the centrist diversity meme is pushed in the U.S., the greater the popular push-back, it seems.
The sites opposing such “correctness” are attracting a much higher audience than those espousing it. But that is not the whole story. It is not even the half of it: “the center” is giving way on multiple fronts (with huge, and likely turbulent consequence).
Most evidently, this is occurring in foreign policy generally, and in the Middle East more particularly. It has been only lightly reported in the MSM, but the U.S. National Security Council again has failed – according to reports – to offer any compelling arguments as to how America might, in any way, succeed in Afghanistan even with a hefty increase in military forces, (as advocated by NSC Advisor H.R. McMaster). It has been a long-haul war – and there will be no pleasing outcome to this war for anyone; rather the opposite – but that has been long evident to almost all who followed events there.

Secondly, Hizballah has routed – in just four days – Al Qaeda from the Arsal enclave in north Lebanon. Once again, Lebanon is contiguous with Syria, just as Iraq is now contiguous, adjoining and open to Syria. Aided by the psychological shock to insurgents of the news of the halting of CIA of weapons and salaries supplied to (some, not all) insurgent groups, the Syrian army and its partner forces are quite rapidly taking back the Syrian state. The U.S. has decided, it seems, that there are no good options for America in Syria, either. And that, when Raqa’a falls and ISIS is defeated, the White House may well conclude that U.S. objectives there will have been met.
Thirdly, the Iraqi people have been passing through a significant metamorphosis. Mobilized and radicalized by ISIS’s physical brutality and ideological totalitarianism in northern Iraq, this is a nation in motion: The political landscape, henceforth, will change too. The Shi’a of Iraq are sensing their empowerment.
The (unpopular) government, and the (respected, but now elderly) Hauza (religious leadership) – necessarily – are having to swim with this new tide of popular mobilization and self-assertion. These profound shifts in mood already are finding their reflection in Iraq’s strategic positioning in that Iraq is moving closer to Russia (i.e. the purchase of Russian T20 tanks), and to Syria and Iran. The “spine” of the Middle East is consolidating in a new way.
This mood-change may well shape, too, the future of Sunni Islam: Most ordinary Iraqi Sunnis have been repelled, and disgusted, by the excesses of Wahhabist Da’esh, (as have Syrians of all sects). Sunni citizens of Mosul – now free to relate their experiences – have been telling their Iraqi compatriots (I have been told) of their lingering anger at the ISIS’s beheadings of the local Sunni clergy for complaining about the un-Islamic actions of foreign jihadists in the ranks of Da’esh in Mosul. This adverse experience of Nejd Islam will have repercussions, ultimately, on Saudi Arabia and its leadership, (now heartily disliked in Iraq) – and America, Saudi Arabia’s close ally.
In short – for Europe and America – the “center” of its Middle East policy is folding (while its Gulf Cooperation Council-led bulwark is in crisis). Across the West, cries of distressed Syria “hawks” are in the air.
There will, of course, be repercussions: Israel will threaten that “it cannot stand idly-by” with Hizbullah and Iran situated on the Golan armistice line, and may try to test Russia’s resolve as guarantor of the southwest Syrian de-escalation zone. Prime Minister Benhamin Netanyahu is particularly angry that Israel has been outmaneuvered in Syria (by Russian President Putin), that the hope to create an Israeli-controlled cordon sanitaire inside southwest Syria has been frustrated. And Israel and its allies now will push the U.S. hard for a punitive containment vice to be imposed on Iran in retribution.
The new Saudi Regent (Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salma or MbS) represents another unpredictable and volatile element in this mix. Despite this, the Pentagon is well aware that much of Israel’s bluster concerning Iran, is just that: bluff. Israel, Saudi Arabia and UAE have no capacity to take on Iran, beyond a day – without America’s full backing.
The other part of “the center,” which is looking increasingly wobbly, is that of economic policy. A consensus seems to be hardening among some market leaders that asset values cannot simply go on levitating upwards – carried up on a sea of liquidity, and near zero interest rates – entailing near zero volatility and one-sided trades that have the market listing like some capsizing, overloaded boat after all the passengers have rushed to one side of the craft.

Some market participants however, seem to believe that the Central Bankers will never have “the spine” either to hike rates, or to shrink their balance sheets, and thus face a market “tantrum.” These participants – until recently, perhaps a majority – believe that the new normal “boat” of low inflation and low rates – will continue to be floated off, practically indefinitely, albeit with the help of a further $20 trillion to $50 trillion of “qualitative easing” or QE.
This argument is far from new, but recently a substantial number of major financial leaders (and some Central Bankers) have been sounding grave warnings about the high multiple valuations of financial assets, about pockets of sub-prime debt re-emerging (automobile loans), and debt-to-GDP levels (personal and public) soaring above 2008 crisis values.
Global debt is up $68 trillion or 46 percent, since the eve of the 2008 financial crisis, and now stands at 327 percent of global output. A critical mass of senior financial opinion seems now to be turning. They put this troubling monetary and market distortion against the prospect of a U.S. debt ceiling likely to guillotine U.S. Federal Government spending quite imminently, and against the probability that deeply conflicted Congress – with polarization in both main parties – being able neither to pass a budget; nor produce the Trump “reflation”; nor even launch a significant infrastructure re-build.
Their fear is that there is a substantial tranche of congressmen and senators in both parties that are so hostile to Trump that they would be happy to see him fall flat on his face – even at the cost of economic crisis. Or, they worry that even if some stimulus is passed, that the Central Banks will remove the liquidity punchbowl from markets too fast. Either way, they see grave risks running through to the end of this year, and into 2018.
In short, not just foreign policy but financial policy, too, may find itself hostage to the dissolved center of U.S. politics – with all which that implies, i.e., the lack of the functioning, largely centralized, mainly cohesive unit, that used to be the American government as it has been known since World War Two.
And here we return to our initial, rather trivial anecdote about Facebook trying to re-establish the centrist meme of gender choice being an undiscussable “protected category.” The point is that the center is not holding: the more it tries, the more it invites, and gets, willful push-back.
Equally, as the hawks clamor to restore the former centrist foreign policy meme that arming, training and paying Wahhabi jihadists to slaughter 100,000 Syrian soldiers (many, if not most of whom, were Sunni) represents an American interest is no longer holding. See, for example, David Stockman’s Bravo! Trump, For The Tweet That Is Shaking The War Party (Trump: “The Amazon Washington Post fabricated the facts on my ending massive, dangerous, and wasteful payments to Syrian rebels fighting Assad…..”).
And the meme that too much debt should be solved by adding even more debt – and that the consequent soaring asset inflation should welcomed as mere confirmation that economic recovery is unfolding, as it should – is no longer holding also. This whole approach is now in in sharp contention.
Even the Central Bankers now worry about asset inflation (that they themselves have nurtured) but they worry even more about the consequences of any attempt to roll it back. They lie between a rock and a hard place.
Where will this take us? Possibly, the psychological turmoil of the reverses in U.S. foreign policy will continue to roil throughout the summer; but come autumn, there may be less U.S. appetite (or attention available) for foreign policy initiatives as the economic “winter” approaches. Or, at worst, the sheer overwhelming conflict on the domestic front could invite the notion that a foreign initiative would prove a welcome distraction from economic woes.
Iran and North Korea are the current U.S. rhetorical punch bags, but neither should ever be contemplated as candidates for some “distraction.” Rather they represent potential nemeses.
As for the economic woes – not so much QE 4 – but direct, deficit funding helicopter money beckons, perhaps. Which is to say that freshly minted new, “empty” money would be used to directly fund Federal expenditure. (Trump in business, has never shied away from debt).
Often it is said that there is no precedent to our present extraordinary monetary circumstances, but the history of the Assignat in France of the early 1790s, offers some hints. Despite massive money creation, Andrew White, in his book Fiat Money Inflation in France (published in 1896) notes that “[t]hough paper money had increased in amount, prosperity had steadily diminished. In spite of all the paper issues, commercial activity grew more and more spasmodic. Enterprise was chilled and business became more and more stagnant”.
Finally, just to be clear, Donald Trump undoubtedly is facilitating the dissolution of the Establishment’s “center” – but that, after all, was his declared aim. But he is not responsible for it. This potential was already latent: he simply saw it – and adroitly, climbed aboard.

And so we come to yet another chapter in the continuing opus of dress code in the late twenty-teens.
The latest plot twist is twofold. On the one hand, the L.P.G.A. has issued much more stringent guidelines that prohibit golfers from wearing shirts with “plunging necklines,” too-short skirts or skorts, or racerback tops without collars, according to a report in Golf Digest.
On the other, the House of Representatives has come under fire because, said CBS News, female reporters were being turned away from the speaker’s lobby — the area outside the House chamber where lawmakers and reporters gather — for wearing sleeveless dresses or open-toe sandals.
In both cases, social media uproar ensued.
Certainly, in the case of the speaker’s lobby, you can see the problem: How can the sergeant-at-arms, the chief law enforcement and protocol officer of the House, deem such garments inappropriate when they are clearly among the most favored by both Melania Trump, the first lady, who wore two sleeveless dresses during an official visit to France last week, and Ivanka Trump, the special adviser to the president, who is pictured in a sleeveless dress on the cover of her recent book, “Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success”?
In any case, Speaker Paul D. Ryan has already ridden to the rescue, announcing at a news conference last week that he would work with the sergeant-at-arms to modernize the official rules, which don’t specifically bar bare shoulders but leave the guidelines open to interpretation. (They also require men to wear jackets and ties.)

Continue reading the main story
Not that we are in for a “casual Friday” Congress — just, maybe, you know, one that is less mired in a last-century definition of “appropriate dress” that treats the female arm like an erogenous zone, the way an ankle was at the turn of the 20th century.
Continue reading the main story
Exactly when the new rules would go into effect or what they would be was not specified. And Mr. Ryan admittedly has a lot on his plate, so the dress code is unlikely to be a top priority.
Still, while he may have seen this as an easy win, electorate-wise, it may prove to be a thornier problem than he was anticipating. Dress code issues have become a cause that resonates far beyond the borders of whatever institution or industry is in question, and one that unites people across political parties and national borders. And sports preferences!

Indeed, we’ve been in something of a dress code revolt for the last few years. There was, for example, the British woman who was sent home from work for wearing flat shoes, only to incite such an uproar on social media that there was an inquiry overseen by two parliamentary committees. And the time State Senator Mitch Holmes of Kansas, chairman of the Senate Ethics and Elections Committee in Topeka, had to apologize for including a guideline that women appearing before the state panel could not wear “low-cut necklines and miniskirts.”
Then there was the whole no-leggings-on-airplanes-for-employees furor at United Airlines this year. And the great male skirt rebellion, in which British schoolboys and French bus drivers wore skirts to protest dress codes banning tailored shorts, despite high temperatures and even though their female peers could wear the airier garments. Even the British Parliament bowed to current reality, with John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, telling members it was no longer necessary to wear a tie, acknowledging that looking “businesslike” did not have to involve neckwear.
The common thread among all of these events, of course, is Twitter et al., which both allowed the beleaguered parties to take their causes to the wider world and then subjected the governing bodies to such mockery for their outdated definitions of dress that almost all of them caved to popular pressure and changed the rules. Just like the House is about to do. We’ll see about the L.P.G.A. But already, Teen Vogue has taken it to task for what the magazine called “body-shaming.”
The issue is that definitions of “appropriate dress,” the catchall phrase for what is expected in a professional wardrobe everywhere from Capitol Hill to pro-am golf to — well, The New York Times — are so vague and open to interpretation that they have an enormously wide margin of error.
After all, what might be “appropriate” at, say, Facebook, at least judging by the favored gray-T-shirts-and-jeans uniform of its chief, Mark Zuckerberg, is probably not appropriate on, say, the House floor.
And who is to judge what is appropriate? The individual? The institution? The term is so vague as to raise the possibility that we should get rid of dress codes entirely. Is that the answer?
Probably not. But that leaves Mr. Ryan, for example, with the option of specifying exactly what “appropriate” means, down to the garment — probably another recipe for trouble, as demonstrated by the L.P.G.A. — or (perhaps easier) specifying what isn’t appropriate (Hawaiian shorts? spaghetti-strap dresses?). Or simply appending adjectives to the definition of “professional” in an attempt to clarify it for the 21st century.

Vedanta Q1 net doubles on strong volume,"The consolidated net profit of diversified natural resources company — Vedanta— doubled to Rs 1,525 crore for the three months ended June 30, 2017 driven by strong volume growth and commodity prices of zinc and aluminium. (Reuters)
The consolidated net profit of diversified natural resources company — Vedanta— doubled to Rs 1,525 crore for the three months ended June 30, 2017 driven by strong volume growth and commodity prices of zinc and aluminium. This is the first reported quarter of the newly merged Vendanta and Cairn India. The company had clocked a consolidated net profit (attributable before exceptional items) of Rs 754 crore during April-June 2016. Meanwhile, the company has planned a capital expenditure of $1.2 billion for the financial year 2017-2018 and about the same in the next financial year. Speaking to newspersons on a conference call, Tom Albanese, chief executive officer, Vedanta said, “There will be a combination of zinc projects at Hindustan Zinc, rebuilding volumes in oil and gas and possible doubling of copper smelter at Tuticorn.” G R Arun Kumar, chief financial officer, Vedanta said that the company plans to invest Rs 2,500-3,000 crore over the next two to three years in doubling the copper smelter capacity at Tuticorn.
The Indian subsidiary of London-listed Vedanta Plc, reported a y-o-y increase of 27% in revenues at Rs 18,203 crore with higher volumes at Zinc India and ramp-up at aluminium business. Higher commodity prices were partially offset by currency appreciation. “We are realizing the true benefits of Vedanta’s diversified portfolio. Our zinc and oil & gas businesses have delivered a strong quarter. Zinc prices have strengthened since the quarter end on continued global supply deficits. Our continued ramp-up in the aluminium business has helped us exit the quarter on a strong production run rate of 1.4 MTPA,” Albanese said. Ebitda (earning before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) increased 40% y-o-y to Rs 4,965 crore on account of higher volumes at Zinc India; ramp up of volumes at the aluminium business, and higher commodity prices.
However, on a sequential basis, Ebitda was impacted by lower commodity prices, currency appreciation, lower volume at Zinc India as per mine plan and Copper India, lower plant availability at TSPL and higher COP at aluminium business due to input commodity inflation, currency appreciation and pot outages. Ebitda margin on a y-o-y basis was at 36%, up from 32% in Q1FY18 due to increased volumes and cost efficiency. On the company’s debt reduction plans, Albanese said that the company has reduced the gross debt by nearly Rs 9,000 crore in the last four months, and a further Rs 2,500 crore has been reduced post June 30, 2017. As on 30 June 2017, Vedanta’s gross debt stood at Rs 67,342 crore including temporary short term borrowings of Rs 6,959 crore at Zinc India and preference shares of Rs 3,010 crore issued pursuant to the Cairn merger.
Excluding Zinc India temporary borrowings and preference shares, gross debt decreased by Rs 6,288 crore, company said in a statement. Finance cost during the quarter was up by Rs 199 crore to Rs 1,592 crore on account of higher temporary borrowing at Zinc India, capitalisation of aluminium and power capacities and interest on preference shares, partially offset by lower interest rates.",Financial Express,0
Kansas nuclear operator is victim in hacking spree: Bloomberg,"n"">Hackers recently breached a Kansas nuclear power operator as part of a campaign that breached at least a dozen U.S. power firms, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing current and former U.S. officials who were not named.
The Wolf Creek nuclear facility in Kansas was breached in the attack, according to Bloomberg.
A representative with the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp declined to say if the plant was hacked, but said it continued to operate safely.
""There has been absolutely no operational impact to Wolf Creek. The reason that is true is because the operational computer systems are completely separate from the corporate network,"" company spokeswoman Jenny Hageman said in an email to Reuters.
The report identified the first known victims of a hacking campaign targeting the power sector that was first reported by Reuters on June 30. The attacks were described in a confidential June 28 U.S government alert to industrial firms, warning them of a hacking campaign targeting the nuclear, power and critical infrastructure sectors.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation said that hackers had succeeded in compromising networks of some targets, but did not name victims. The government also released a 30-page bulletin with advice on how firms could bolster security to defend against the attacks.
The alert said that hackers have been observed using tainted emails to harvest credentials to gain access to networks of their targets.
""Historically, cyber actors have strategically targeted the energy sector with various goals ranging from cyber espionage to the ability to disrupt energy systems in the event of a hostile conflict,"" the report said.
Homeland Security and the FBI issued a statement to Reuters late on Thursday saying that the alert was part of an ongoing effort to advise industry of cyber threats.
""There is no indication of a threat to public safety, as any potential impact appears to be limited to administrative and business networks,"" the agencies said.
A nuclear industry spokesman told Reuters on Saturday that hackers have never gained access to a nuclear plant.
The Homeland Security technical bulletin included details of code used in a hacking tool that suggest the hackers sought to use the password of a Wolf Creek employee to access the network.
Hageman declined to say if hackers had gained access to that employee's account. The employee could not be reached for comment.

Soros-Funded Militant Group Claims ‘German Contingent’ At G20 Protests,"Refuse Fascism, an American militant group funded in part by George Soros, claims to have a “German contingent” at the massive G20 protests in Hamburg, Germany this week.
The G20 protests, dubbed “Welcome To Hell” by its organizers, have increasingly turned into violent riots that have injured hundreds of police officers.

The group claimed on Facebook Thursday to have a presence “right now in Hamburg, Germany G20 Summit where Trump is speaking,” and pointed out one of its banners among the thousands of protesters.
The group made a similar claim on Twitter, celebrating the presence of “a German Refuse Fascism contingent” at the “massive protests.”

As previously reported by The Daily Caller’s Chuck Ross, one of Refuse Fascism’s fiscal sponsors is the Soros-funded Alliance for Global Justice.
Refuse Fascism also claims direct ties to a Cornel West, an Ivy League professor and member of the 2016 DNC platform committee. West is among several left-wing professors listed as one of the group’s “initiators.” (RELATED: DNC Platform Member Cornel West Tied To Violent Berkeley Rioters)
Refuse Fascism is also one of the militant left-wing groups who organized the violent riots against Milo Yiannopoulos in Berkeley, California earlier this year.

The group is also planning nationwide demonstrations against President Trump to take place on July 15.
“July 15th must be a day when every person, every group – religious, community, service, political organization – all who feel the tremendous threat to humanity posed by the Trump/Pence regime – stand together showing the world that people here are determined that this regime must go … not in two years or four, but now,” a description for the July 15 protest states.
“July 15th must mark a leap to more sustained struggle, inspiring people to see the possibility of ousting this regime through unleashing the tremendous power of the people – aiming for the time when millions can be moved to fill the streets of cities and towns day after day and night after night, declaring this whole regime illegitimate – Demanding, and Not Stopping, Until The Trump/Pence Regime Is Driven from Power.”

The ONE SENTENCE Trump’s New Pick For FBI Director Just Said Will Have Comey Crying On The Floor,"Joker 42 mins agoNews, Politics, USA, World25 Views
President Trump’s nominee for FBI Director just blew the doors off the White House with an opening statement for the history books. Christopher Wray released his opening statement for his testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, with a focus both eloquent and patriotic.
“I am honored to be nominated by the President to lead the FBI and humbled by the prospect of working alongside the outstanding men and women of the Bureau,” said Wray. “Time and time again…they have proven their unshakeable commitment to protecting the American people, upholding the Constitution and laws of the United States, and demonstrating the virtues found in the FBI motto: Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity.”
Now this is what we need in charge of our country’s safety. Someone determined to uphold President Trump’s American dream and work hand-in-hand with our administration to make it happen. Wray’s commitment to teamwork was further expressed in his statement, giving credit generously to the “special agents, analysts, and support staff” of the DOJ that do not get the same level of recognition as directors but nevertheless “toil at great risk to themselves and at great sacrifice by their families.”
But the end of Wray’s statement was by far the most impressive, and EXACTLY what Americans needed to hear.
“If I am given the honor of leading this agency, I will never allow the FBI’s work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law, and the impartial pursuit of justice,” concluded Wray. “Period.”
Wray wrapped it up with a simple and honest promise to “make every American proud.”
I think it’s about time we had a man with this level of resolve and patriotism running the FBI. The more and more we get further from Comey the better, and President Trump continues to prove time and time again why his decision to appoint a fresh face with a fresh set of values was the right move for this country.
Are you proud of your President’s choice? Are you excited for our country’s future?
If so, SHARE THIS LIKE CRAZY! These are the people we need to support and we need to do it NOW!

The Paradox of Tolerance/Intolerance,"The issue of “tolerance” can be complicated, even paradoxical, such as extending tolerance to intolerance with the possibility that the intolerance will ultimately eliminate tolerance, explains Lawrence Davidson.
In case you haven’t noticed, the United States is a country deeply divided on a large number of basic issues: racial issues, gender issues, issues of sexual preference, the role of government in society, the role of religious views in shaping laws, and so on. Influential Institutions, such as media outlets, are being labeled as “left” or “right” depending on how they report or relate on these issues.
The University of Chicago.
Battles now rage on these topics in the halls of Congress. Finally, the Supreme Court’s legal decisions on cases that reflect these questions have been trending toward the “conservative” end of the spectrum. All of this makes it quite difficult to have a meaningful discussion or debate about such issues in the public realm. Such attempts have often led to further divisiveness instead of reconciliation – reflecting what some might describe as an ongoing culture war.
The one place where thoughtful debates are usually encouraged is on the university and colleges campuses. This is particularly so in the “humanities” and “social sciences” classrooms, where you find courses in history, English, foreign languages, sociology, anthropology, political science and the like. Such areas of study draw on diverse source material and examples. And so, running against the popular grain, so to speak, divisive issues often become legitimate aspects of study.
This process of study and discussion concerning controversial topics has been going on at U.S. campuses at least since the end of World War II. By the 1970s clear preferences as to how these issues should be thought about appeared. And, they consistently agreed with a tolerant stand that maximized the virtues of equality and social justice. It should come as no surprise that faculty in these areas are usually left of center on the political spectrum.
Thus, the campus consensus is that while an individual can privately feel as he or she likes about topics such as homosexuality or racial integration, and can choose their social circle accordingly, it is wrong to publicly act in an overtly discriminatory way. Until recently the courts have agreed with this position, but now things appear to be changing.
Such a trend in the direction of public intolerance has begun to isolate the campus environment while at the same time denigrating the tolerant position as “political correctness” — as if being correct and thus legitimate, appropriate and proper was a failing.
A Republican Attack on the University
This process of isolating one of the staunchest bastions of active public tolerance has recently been highlighted by a new (July 2017) report of the Pew Research Center entitled Sharp Partisan Divisions In Views of National Institutions.
The late Roger Ailes, who pioneered the right-wing structure of Fox News.
According to the report, there has been “a dramatic attitude shift on higher education among Republicans and people who lean Republican.” It would seem that “Republicans have soured on higher education, with more than half [a reported 58 percent of them] now saying that colleges have a negative impact on the United States.”
The more conservative the Republican respondent described him- or herself, the more likely they are to have a negative view of higher educational institutions. This compares with 72 percent of Democrats who saw the contribution of colleges on society as positive. Of course, Democrats now have problems getting elected.
There is a link between those who hold a negative view of institutions of higher learning and those who confine themselves to watching or listening to the country’s right-wing media.
As it turns out, “Virtually every day Fox News, Breitbart and other conservative outlets run critical articles about free speech disputes on college campuses, typically with coverage focused on the perceived liberal orthodoxy and political correctness in higher education.” Now consider that Fox News is the most popular news (or shall we say, alleged news) show on U.S. television.
The success of right-wing news and other media is a good example of viewers practicing, perhaps unconsciously, confirmation bias. The criterion for the information you seek out is not accuracy or truth, but rather its ability to confirm an outlook you already hold.
Of course, one does not have to be right-wing to play this particular game but, ultimately it makes a difference if you are among the intolerant. Intolerant worldviews are closed systems. Once you have committed to them you have put on blinkers and become one of the faithful — no more debates, no more discussions, no more broadmindedness, no more tolerance. People without your blinkers start to appear as dangerous, heretical, unpatriotic. You are now bound to a “group think” that is starkly undemocratic.
As intolerance under the leadership of Republicans and neo-Republicans (Trump, Bannon, Tea Party types, etc.) becomes more widespread, those institutions that value tolerance come under pressure. This sometimes comes from right-wing media, sometimes from special interest donors and lobbyists, and sometimes, in the case of college and universities, from pockets of students (both right and left) who have decided that some outlooks are so unacceptable that they must be silenced. Whenever reasonable this last action should be avoided.
Chief White House Strategist Steve Bannon speaking at the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland.
If you don’t like what campus speakers stand for or say, one’s default position should not be to shut them down, but rather to use their presence as a teaching moment: here is how not to build a healthy society. However, in the midst of a culture war, the tolerant may ultimately find themselves painted into a corner.
We can legitimately ask how far the Republican Right is willing to push their campaign of intolerance against tolerant college campuses. Having lost the open campus debates on an array of divisive issues, they now react with a poisonous version of sour grapes. They declare that “colleges have a negative impact on the United States.”
If they take this charge to Congress or to the courts, we may come to a point where tolerance of extreme intolerance is no longer reasonable. Given that level of threat we should all be aware of Karl Popper’s description of the paradox of tolerance: “unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.”
This is the dilemma that is forced upon us when war — in this case a culture war — takes over the public mind. The space for tolerance shrinks and it is the barbarians among us who start to define the rules of social interaction.

Missing North Carolina girl found in Georgia; alleged captor due in court,"Michael Ren Wysolovski, 31, charged in connection to the disappearance of a North Carolina teenager found alive over the weekend in Duluth, Georgia, after she had been missing for more than a year, according to authorities, is shown in this book photo provided June 26, 2017....
ATLANTA A Georgia man is due in court on Monday on charges related to the disappearance of a North Carolina teenager found alive over the weekend after she had been missing for more than a year, authorities said.
Hailey Burns, now 17, disappeared from her home in Charlotte about 13 months ago. After authorities received a tip late Saturday regarding her possible whereabouts, they found her being held at a house in Duluth, Georgia, about 25 miles north of Atlanta, FBI spokeswoman Shelley Lynch said on Monday.
“Agents from the local office and Gwinnett County police went out to the location and took the suspect in custody without trouble,"" Lynch said in a phone interview.
The suspect, Michael Ren Wysolovski, 31, is charged in Georgia state court with false imprisonment, aggravated sodomy, interference with custody and cruelty to children, according to jail records. It was unclear if he had a lawyer.
Neighbors told local media they rarely saw the teenager at the well-kept home, and neither she nor the man there ever spoke to them.
Burns' parents told WSOC-TV in Charlotte that their daughter met Wysolovski online, and he apparently drove to North Carolina to meet her.
""(He) got her in the car, brought her straight to his house and she pretty much had to stay there the whole time,"" the mother Shaunna Burns told the TV station.
Shaunna Burns said the tip that led to the girl's rescue came from a woman in Romania, whom their daughter also met online and told she was missing. Within hours, the woman reached out to the parents.
Lynch said Wysolovski could face additional charges. He is being held at the Gwinnett County Detention Center without bond.
“Hailey has been reunited with her parents,"" the FBI said in a press release. ""They are grateful for the outpouring of support they have received while she's been missing, but they ask for privacy at this time to focus on their daughter.""

A beauty blogger tried to start the ‘Chocolate challenge.’ Critics say it’s blackface,"A screen capture of Vika Shapel’s Instagram post Twitter
A screen capture of Vika Shapel’s Instagram post Twitter
July 14, 2017 9:47 PM
 
An aspiring beauty blogger prompted a wave of backlash with an Instagram post that many consider insensitive at best and downright racist at worst.
Vika Shapel, a white woman, reportedly from Portland, Oregon, posted an image of herself and a friend with dark makeup on half of their faces and the caption, “Something fun is coming to YouTube, idk if there is a challenge like this but we haven’t seen it so I’m calling it the chocolate challenge! Come watch us transform into deep chocolate skin tones from our pasty pale.
Almost immediately, critics blasted Shapel, saying the image showed her in blackface, a historically offensive practice of darkening the skin with makeup, often for exaggerated effect in entertainment.
The first critique appears to have been from YouTube personality Arnell Armon. Others quickly chimed in.

In an interview with Yahoo, Shapel apologized for the post and said she was unaware of the historical legacy of blackface.
“I simply wanted to see how I looked in a deeper skin tone,” Shapel told Yahoo Beauty. “I wasn’t aware of the whole black face concept before people began commenting it on the photo. I would like to apologize to people that were hurt or offended by my post, and it won’t happen again.”
Shapel also told Yahoo that she had deactivated her social media accounts because of “overwhelming hateful responses,” she said. Her YouTube page has been scrubbed of all videos.
As Yahoo reports, some social media users also noted that Shapel and the other woman pictured appeared to have curled their hair and changed the color of their eyes.
Shapel is not alone in being accused of using black face as a beauty trend. Kim Kardashian drew heat online in late June after ads for her new makeup line appeared to show her skin in a darker than usual color, according to the New York Times. Kardashian’s sister, model Kendall Jenner, also was criticized by social media users in 2015 after an Instagram post appeared to show her with dark skin and had the caption: “What I wish I looked like all the time,” according to E! News.
Most recently, a pizzeria owner in Boise, Idaho, apologized after a Facebook video promoting his restaurant showed him with black paint smeared across this face.

Moreover, Patrushev encouraged foreign security officials to be more active in implementing the provisions of international agreements on fighting terrorism. This includes UN Security Council resolutions concerning terrorists who return home from hot spots and measures aimed at destroying channels of terrorism sponsorship:
“We are confident that considering the threat that comes from the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) terrorist group as well as the danger of other terrorist organizations, we must act resolutely. And we count on our colleagues’ support in this.”
BRICS is an international group that consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The five major emerging economies constitute about half of the world’s population and 30 percent of global economic output.
Before, Patrushev already called for unity among BRICS countries noting that Western nations tried to suppress the bloc’s development. Earlier this year, he warned that foreign secret services attempted to destabilize the social and political situation in Russia.
Why prevent BRICS from countering terrorism? Why not fight it together?
The only reasonable explanation would be that the goals are rather different: one wants terrorism to end, while the other wants it to prosper…",The Duran,1
"Tekfusion Twinwoofers M2 priced at Rs 1,999 offers hi-fi sound, noise free calls","Experience high fidelity sound and noise-free calls on Tekfusion’s Twinwoofers M2 headset.
Most smartphones these days come bundled with a pair of in-ear earbuds; however, they are not exactly high-quality. For casual music listeners they are fine, but if you want a slightly better experience then you need to invest in a superior in-ear headset. The market is flooded with these models, but it can be hard to find the perfect fit. Many of you may not have heard about Tekfusion, a Bangalore-based audio company that makes high-quality headphones. Its latest product, Twinwoofers M2, is an inexpensive headset that doesn’t cut any corners, despite its low price. I have been using the Twinwoofers M2 In-Ear headset for the past few days, and here’s my verdict.
The Twinwoofers M2 earphones have a simple design. The thick metallic earpieces are well-built, and super light, which makes them good looking and relatively comfortable over longer periods of time. These have a microphone and a remote for controlling music playback and answering call—but no volume control, unfortunately. The Twinwoofers M2 weighs only 9.5g without the cable.
I did not face any issue finding the perfect fit; they stayed in my ears whether I was running from one corner to another at the busy Shoreline amphitheatre or attending a long distance call. The Twinwoofers M2 also come with five different sizes of ear tip in the box to ensure the right fit, and a carrying case for travelling. The earphones have a 1.2 m cable, with the microphone and remote located on the cable leading to the earpiece. Surprisingly, the cable is not prone to tangling.
Audio quality and performance
The 10-mm dynamic drivers in the Twinwoofers M2 pump out reasonably good sound. Audio quality is surprisingly great, much better than I expected for the price. They sound fantastic with thumping bass. Everything sounds natural on the Twinwoofers M2: pop, hip-hop, rock, dance, classical and metal. All this makes these earbuds great not only for listening to music, but also for movies and video games. And they work with a variety of audio sources. I tested the Twinwoofers M2 with the iPhone 5c, Asus ZenFone 3, iPod Classic, Amazon Fire tablet, PS Vita and Nintendo 3DS XL.
The one area where they excelled is in cancelling the background noise. Although the company itself is not claiming that these earphones have built-in noise cancellation feature, to my surprise, the Twinwoofers M2 helps to block out the noise. I tested them on the noisy Noida Sector 16 metro station and walking in Delhi’s busy Chandni Chowk area.
The Twinwoofers M2 is a great choice for anyone who is looking to replace those not-so-worthy Apple EarPods. After a lot of listening, I can definitely vouch for the Twinwoofers M2. These earbuds provide booming sound that doesn’t lose its clarity even in a noisy environment. Priced at Rs 1,999, the Twinwoofers M2 provides an affordable way to experience rich audio quality without burning a hole in your pocket.

This Racist Father Disowned His Daughter When She Took A Black Date To Prom,"Home WOW This Racist Father Disowned His Daughter When She Took A Black Date...
 
Going to senior prom is one the most exciting moments in High School. It’s a rite of passage in our younger years and leads us on the journey to adulthood. Choosing the right dress or tuxedo, chatting with friends about who to take with you to prom and pulling up in the sweetest ride are among the most important decisions you can make besides graduation and college.
Fast forward to 18-year old Anna Hayes, who had THIS very important moment ruined by her racist father.
Hayes, is a White high school senior from Lake Village, Arkansas who attended prom with a male friend, Phillip Freeman who is Black.
When her estranged father saw the photos online, he sent his daughter a long racist, sexist and abusive set of messages telling Anna that he was disowning her.
Anna and Phillip are just friends – with the young teen saying she chose to go to prom with Phillip because he’s ‘really funny’ and ‘super cute.’
Unfortunately, Anna’s dad — who she says has always been racist — wasted no time in blasting his daughter’s decision and sharing his ignorant views.
‘We are done,’ he texted her. ‘I won’t be coming to your graduation. Nor will I pay for your college. Go live with the n*****s.’
Anna explained to BuzzFeed that she and her dad have had a difficult relationship over the years.
Anna’s parents are divorced, and though she lived with her father briefly as a child, she’s been living with her mom since her early teens.
Responding to his initial texts, Anna wrote: ‘I went to prom with a black guy so that’s a problem … racist much.’
‘Yes I am,’ her dad wrote back unashamedly, later saying to his own daughter: ‘Your dead to me.’
‘Don’t ever contact me again we are through,’ he added. ‘Go ahead be a F***IN wh*** leave me out of it. [sic].
He also told her that he was cancelling her cell phone and her car insurance, to which she replied, ‘I didn’t do anything wrong.’
‘He has told me that if I ever dated a black guy that I will and would be dead to him,’ Anna told BuzzFeed. ‘I stood my ground for what I believe in. He has called me several horrible things before.’
She added: ‘This just hurt more because I can not believe how anyone can hate someone they don’t even know because of their skin color… ‘My mother was horrified and felt terrible but there isn’t anything she can do.’
Her date, Phillip, also shared screenshots of the exchange on Twitter, where they’ve garnered an overwhelming amount of sympathy and support. ‘It’s important for people to see that racism is very much alive,’ she said.

Fear Strikes Executive Branch As Trump’s War On Leakers Gathers Steam,"By any measure, qualitative or quantitative, the Trump administration has been beset with a deluge of leaks that is unprecedented in American history. Some leaks are to be expected. White House officials leak policy trial balloons (these aren’t technically leaks as they are planned and approved) and they dish on one another for transitory political advantage. Other leaks are generated by political opponents of the administration in order to harm or embarrass the administration and they often damage national security in the process.
Ron Johnson’s Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs has released a report documenting the volume of this latter category of leaks and it is mindboggling:
When the committee staff stripped out leaks that focused on the Russia probe and law enforcement items and looked at leaks with the possibility to injure national security, the numbers are even more stark:
Today, Politico reports that pressure is being ratcheted up on leakers, causing them undue stress:
National security officials across the federal government say they are seeing new restrictions on who can access sensitive information, fueling fears in the intelligence and security community that the Trump administration has stepped up a stealthy operation to smoke out leakers.
Officials at various national security agencies also say they are becoming more concerned that the administration is carefully tracking what they’re doing and who they’re talking to — then plotting to use them as a scapegoat or accuse them of leaks.
One U.S. official voiced concern over even talking to their superiors about a benign call from a reporter. The agency this official works for had started limiting staff’s access to information, they said, and it would make it far easier to figure out who was talking to people in the media.
There was suspicion, the official said, that the agency was even tracking what they printed, to keep tabs on what information they were accessing.
As someone who has worked in a SCIF (thankfully for a short time) and who dealt with highly classified information on a daily basis during parts of my military career, what strikes me about this opening is the extent to which a culture of gossip seems to have permeated many of these agencies. You shouldn’t be taking “benign” calls from reporters if you aren’t a leaker. Press contacts are passed to an agency communications office and they decide who will speak for the agency and what the main talking points will be. You shouldn’t be gossiping with colleagues about classified information you have access to but which they don’t. If you are afraid your boss is going to be monitoring what you are printing, maybe you shouldn’t be printing it.
A half dozen officials across the national security community described to POLITICO a series of subtle and no-so-subtle changes that have led to an increasingly tense and paranoid working environment rooted in the White House’s obsession with leaks.
The correct term here is “leakers,” not officials.
The reverberations have spread in the weeks since, and several national security officials outside the White House have spoken of a strategic thinning of the ranks — limiting the number of people even read into certain sensitive matters, so that if something leaks, the suspects are obvious.
“The circles on this are so small,” one U.S. intelligence official said of the various Russia investigations that have cast a shadow on Trump’s White House.
Information on Trump and Russia has been so limited there would be fewer and fewer sources, the official said, putting those who are talking at risk. “Confirming [Russia news] is almost impossible,” the official said.
In some cases, the official added, information has been so “choked down” that if something comes out in the press, “it’s either a bogus leak” or, the official said, the relevant agency will know exactly where it came from. And, the official said, they had heard several other government organizations had started doing the same.
In other words, the administration is establishing a level of discipline and information security that should have been in existence all along. Need-to-know, not security clearance, is the gold standard of any security program.
“There’s an increasing concern that they may be moving beyond monitoring official communications,” the second U.S. official said. It’s “likely the case,” the official said, that the administration could be tracking the personal communications channels of federal employees — especially those close to the White House — including personal email accounts.
Yes, indeed. If there is suspicion of national security information being leaked, a warrant can be obtained to monitor personal communications. And that does appear to be happening:
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has apparently heeded Trump’s guidance, launching multiple investigations and delivering a public scolding during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on June 13 to “persons in our intelligence agencies.”
“I fear that some people may find that they wish they hadn’t leaked,” Sessions ominously warned.
While Sessions spoke vaguely of active investigations, several intelligence officials told POLITICO those probes are being closely guarded.
“There’s been some [crimes reports] sent over and there’s more in the process,” one intelligence official said they had heard, though the official stressed the majority of the information was unconfirmed rumor.
Keep in mind, that these investigations are limited to leaks of national security information, not merely embarrassing stuff:
President Obama also issued Executive Order 13526 in 2009 governing classified national security information. Section 1.4 specifies the categories of information subject to classification because “unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause identifiable or discernible damage to the national security.”11 The categories include “intelligence activities”; “foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States”; “military plans, weapons systems, or operations”; and “scientific, technological or economic matters relating to the national security.”
Any intelligence or security professional will tell you that the weak link in security is always the human. No matter how great a system appears to be on paper, a careless or deceitful person can breach it because all systems are basically designed with the assumption that employees will follow rules. What the administration is doing here, though, will have a ripple effect far beyond stopping leaks. If you look at the Manning, Snowden, and Winner cases, they were able to access information for which they had no valid need-to-know. In Winner’s case, she was able to print at least one classified document that she had no reason to access and no one was the wiser. China rolling up long running CIA networks has all the marks of someone gossiping to the wrong person.

Guilty Verdicts Crash in on Kyrgyz Media Outlet,"The outlook is not good for Idinov, Zanoza, or Kyrgyzstan.
Naryn Idinov (also known by the name Naryn Aiyp), the co-founder of ProMedia, which runs the popular Kyrgyz news site Zanoza.kg, told the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) recently that he expected guilty verdicts in the five lawsuits brought against him and ProMedia.
His expectations have proven correct, so far.
On June 30, a court in Bishkek sided with the prosecutor general against four defendants: Idinov, Zanoza editor-in-chief Dina Maslova, Zanoza.kg and former member of parliament Cholpon Dzhakupova. According to EurasiaNet, Zanoza.kg was found “guilty on two counts of besmirching the honor of President Almazbek Atambayev, to whom they must now pay 15 million som (around $215,000)” and Dzhakupova ordered to pay 3 million som ($43,000).

This particular case related to comments made by Dzhakupova in March, reported by Idinov in Zanoza. According to EurasiaNet Dzhakupova said “that the president was a ‘personality with maniacal inclinations’ who should ‘read the constitution.’”
Dzhakupova, who left parliament in December over her disagreement with the constitutional referendum, runs a legal clinic. In April, when the suit was filed, Fergana interviewed Dzhakupova. She commented that the authorities were trying to stamp out dissent:
Actually, the main goal is to intimidate the society: see what they will do with the one that dares to criticize and object to the president… reading their gobbledygook is simply [a] delight. I am accused, because ‘the stylistic construction of speech contains emotionally expressive elements, irony and sarcasm. The lexical and semantic and contextual analysis of words and expressions showed that they have negative information’… Irony and sarcasm are now being banned, as well as any criticism of the President … I just can’t find the language to describe my outrage.
In comments reported by EurasiaNet, Dzhakupova called the verdict predictable and said the lawsuits were a “terrorizing tactic” ahead of October’s presidential elections.
On July 1, the same court sided again with the prosecutor general against Idinov and Zanoza, this time in relation to an October 2015 article about Atambayev’s “lavish lifestyle.” The article, titled “The President’s Millions: Who Really Paid For The Banquet?” was considered insulting, Idinov wrote for openDemocracy in March, because of two sentences. “The General Prosecutor considers that the sentences in question ‘unambiguously lead the reader to believe that president Atambayev has committed a crime, in particular, theft,’” he wrote.
Idinov and Zanoza were ordered to pay 3 million som ($43,000), each.
On July 3, the same court (each case had a different judge) upheld the prosecutor general’s charges that Idinov and Zanoza had defamed the president, this time in relation to a pair of March 2017 articles. One article was about parliamentary discussions regarding the arrest of Omurbek Tekebayev, and another about authoritarian leaders. Notably, the second article did not, apparently, reference Atambayev directly. But the prosecutor general called as evidence the testimony of a linguist to support its claim that the article defamed the president. 24.kg reported that the prosecutor general insisted “at the tone of the article was negative and comparing Kyrgyzstan with other countries… thereby causing moral sufferings to the President of the country.”
Idinov and Zanoza were again ordered to pay 3 million som ($43,000), each.
Two more suits remain open, but the outlook is not good for Idinov, Zanoza or Kyrgyzstan.

New Report Suggests Seth Rich Murdered by ‘Hired Killer’,"Written by Keely Sharp
This report, if correct, just confirms exactly what we have all been thinking. Although those who have spoken out about it, such as Hannity, have received extreme backlash from the liberal mainstream media. Perhaps because they know the truth and want to keep it buried.
This new, independent report suggests that DNC staffer Seth Rich was not killed at random or by way of a robbery….but rather murdered by a third part: a “hired killer.”
Here is a summary of an “all-volunteer group of current and former George Washington University forensic psychology graduate students and instructors” and what they found:

What do you think about this report? There are too many factors that do not add up in Rich’s murder. Why would someone who was robbing him, kill him and then leave all his belongings on him? Yet that is the story that the left would like you to believe. That he was simply killed in robbery-gone wrong.

Not So Black and White
A barista had just finished preparing an order and then called out “tall, black Marques; tall, black Marques.” Marques, a 6-foot-2 African-American man who works for a demolition company based in Colorado, stood bewildered by what seemed to be a racially charged incident inside a Starbucks.
After realizing the misunderstanding — “tall, black” was referring to the coffee, not the person ordering it — he laughed and defused the situation with a joke: “That’s me, tall black Marques!”

In New York, so much of my life consists of walking in and through crowds. I am, I think, a good walker. I don’t dawdle, and even when walking at high speeds, I’m courteous — always willing to sway to one side, change speed in traffic or even take wide berths around large, lost, child-toting or otherwise compromised gaggles of pedestrians.
There are many times in a day when a person is walking toward me and in my path. In these situations, we both generally make minor adjustments upon our approach. Sometimes, and especially with pedestrians who are black, as I am, there’s eye contact or even a nod. Almost always, we shift our bodyweight or otherwise detour to make the pass easier for the other. Walking courteously doesn’t take much, just soupçons of spatial awareness, foresight and empathy. In seven years of living and walking here, I’ve found that most people walk courteously — but that white women, at least when I’m in their path, do not.
Sometimes they’re buried in their phones. Other times, they’re in pairs and groups, and in conversation. But often, they’re looking ahead, through me, if not quite at me. When white women are in my path, they almost always continue straight, forcing me to one side without changing their course. This happens several times a day; and a couple of times a week, white women force me off the sidewalk completely. In these instances, when I’m standing in the street or in the dirt as a white woman strides past, broad-shouldered and blissful, I turn furious.
I turn furious because in these instances I feel small. I always get out of the way, because I was taught at a young age not to bodycheck random people. But I also get out of the way because, as a black man, I’ve learned that bodychecking, bumping or even rubbing against a random white woman can be personally hazardous. So I acknowledge other pedestrians, and reroute. White men and all people of color do the same to me. They offer some form of acknowledgment that we are in each other’s path, that I am there at all.
Continue reading the main story
After these encounters, I’m always left with questions. Why only and specifically white women? Do they refuse to acknowledge me because they’ve been taught that they should fear black men, and that any acknowledgment of black men can invite danger? Do they refuse to acknowledge me because to alter their route would be to show their fear? Do they not see me? Can they not see me?
I wonder, too, why I always get out of the way. Why haven’t I ever just walked headlong into a rude white woman? What lessons tug at me, force me off the sidewalk, tell me that my personal space is not necessarily mine? Because explicit in every white woman’s decision not to get out of my way is the expectation that I’ll get out of theirs.
There have always been white women in my life, and I’ve counted them as friends and sisters, mothers and lovers. Whenever I ask white women I know why they don’t reroute for black men, they invariably express ignorance. Whenever that happens, another question always arises: Wait, am I crazy? But then I ask black men. Invariably, they know what I’m talking about.
A couple of weeks ago, I asked an Asian friend if he had the same experience of white women not getting out of his way. He said no. For whatever reason, white women see him just fine. The people who don’t, he said, are white men.

I was eager to share the journey of my career with the world, via Jopwell, a diversity hiring start-up. As a woman of color holding various leadership roles in technology, this is something I take great pride in. I am often contacted by recruiters and asked to share my network of colleagues as an aid in placing people in tech roles, and have at times been pitched for jobs because my resume and experience are aligned with the position they are trying to fill — at least that’s what I thought.
The day my Jopwell article was released, I was approached with many positive comments and remarks, especially from recruiting agencies I have not met stating, “Nice to finally meet you,” or “Congrats on all your success.” But amid all my joyous remarks and comments, one email from Hire Talent reversed the entire day. The email was addressed as “Hello Black” and proceeded to pitch a job to me for employment. I was immediately bewildered. I just sat and glanced at the computer for a few minutes in complete disbelief that this was happening to me, as I have never been confronted with racism directly. Once I gathered my thoughts, I replied to the email asking, “Is this how you address potential employees for your clients? By race?” Their instantaneous reply stated that this was a technical error and offered many apologies and various phone calls.
Well, one thing you cannot do to a person with my extensive tech background is blame a technical error and expect me not to investigate. Of course, this led me to do some digging into their creation of their email templates and how they import, sort and organize the data, and my findings brought a bigger issue to light. There did, in fact, happen to be a technical error in how the template had generated the email that was sent to me — but what was not an error was that each candidate in their database is categorized by race.
What seems to have taken place is that they saw the article and filled in my race (or what they think I identify as) into their spreadsheet, and instead of my “NAME” being populated into the email, the “RACE” category did. This experience has made me wonder if all candidates seeking employment have the same fair opportunity at getting hired if agencies are categorizing and profiling as such, or am I being contacted only to fill company diversity quotas and not because of my history of accomplishments? I am left puzzled yet inspired.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — This might seem like just a story about tortilla chips, but I assure you it’s much deeper than that. It is — I think — a lesson on racial and cultural alliances.
Continue reading the main story
As a black man, I usually feel a deep kinship with other racial minorities, even those who are not black.
Sure, there are deep-rooted tensions between black folks and Latinos, and black people and Asians. But I have always felt that our shared struggles in a white-dominated society trumped our differences.
But a recent trip to my favorite no-frills Latin American restaurant here has me rethinking this.
It’s a place where the chicken tacos are chargrilled to perfection and almost everyone speaks Spanish. My black wife and I are usually the only diners there who are not of Hispanic descent. Nonetheless, I’ve always felt like we belonged — I even got one of their punch cards that rewards five visits with a free meal.
After we ordered our tacos recently, the waitress, unsolicited, told us that they were out of chips and that she therefore could not give us any as they usually do.
Yet a short time later, a Latino couple was seated, and their waitress brought them chips. Same thing with another group after that.
“Hmm,” my wife said, “seems like they fried some more chips.”
So as we were our eating tacos, I asked our waitress if they had chips now. They don’t, she told me, but right at that moment a waitress walked out from kitchen carrying chips for another table. Our waitress’s eyes went wide. She asked her co-worker something about chips in Spanish. (We don’t speak Spanish.)
The second waitress responded in Spanish, and the only thing I caught was “un poquito.” Yet our waitress turned back to us and repeated that they were all out of chips.

We were now officially baffled, and the staff seemed to be getting nervous. A manager kept coming by our table to check on us, and giving a pained expression at the same time. Our waitress offered us churros. We declined, but she came back offering a different dessert, and we took it.
As we were preparing to leave, another party of Latinos showed up, and their waitress brought them — you guessed it — chips.
Now, the manager standing behind the counter appeared super anxious. He offered me a beer. I declined. He insisted. But I declined again.
We honestly didn’t want chips that bad. But what was going on? They offered us free dessert, free beer, but they drew the line at the (cheapest option) chips? That made little sense to me.
Had I miscalculated my status at this restaurant and my bond with the fellow racial minorities who ran it? The best theory that we could come up with was that they were running out of chips and wanted to save them for the Latino customers. Being black, we were left out.
I went back to the restaurant a few days later and posed that theory to the manager who was there that night, Alex Hernandez.
“Oh no, no. No. No. No,” Mr. Hernandez said when I asked if our race had anything to do with our not receiving chips. “That’s, like, discrimination.”
When we arrived, Mr. Hernandez said, the restaurant was out of chips. By the time our food had come out, they had fried more chips. But because we were already eating our tacos, they did not bring us any chips, he said.
Continue reading the main story
But what about when I asked the waitress for chips?
Mr. Hernandez said that he didn’t know why she did not bring us chips, and that if he had known that we wanted them, he would have brought them to us. At the same time, however, he said that he had offered me the beer because he felt bad that it had taken a long time for our food to come out (it was a really busy night) and because we did not get chips. But if he did not know that we wanted chips, why did he feel bad about that?
Mr. Hernandez did not really have an answer, other than to reiterate that he felt bad for us and that if we would have asked him for chips, he would have brought them. He apologized profusely.
The tacos and pupusas I ate satisfied me just fine. I would like to believe that this was nothing more than a misunderstanding, just a case of poor service.
Yet I can’t help but wonder now, in the larger universe of racial alliances, how do our teams actually line up?

Adam Barnett, a Miami businessman accused of plotting to have a witness and his own defense lawyer murdered, took the stand Friday in his own defense. David OvalleMiami Herald
July 24, 2017 9:22 AM
 
Prosecutors allege that Miami businessman Adam Barnett, while in jail awaiting trial on a sex charge, hired a fellow inmate to organize a plot to murder the key witness — plus his own defense lawyer.
But Barnett, against the advice of his newest attorney, took to the stand in his own defense to spin an elaborate explanation for why he paid the inmate tens of thousands of dollars.
The gist of his tale: The inmate beat him up and threatened to frame him unless he forked over cash.
“I don't like to use the word slave, but I was his B-I-T-C-H,” Barnett told jurors late Friday during his trial for conspiracy to commit murder. “He owned me.”
Barnett will resume his testimony on Monday in Miami-Dade criminal court, the fourth week of an unusual trial that has featured a cast of only-in-Miami characters.
The 43-year-old businessman has a checkered past. In lawsuits, investors have accused him of duping them in a penny-stock scam that cost them millions. State and court records also document numerous stalking allegations by former business associates and even an ex-stylist.
He was convicted on one misdemeanor stalking charge, records show, and put on probation.
But Barnett was arrested again in 2012 after police said he set up a fake Facebook page — purporting to be a Hooters waitress named Janet Rodriguez — with the aim of befriending a 17-year-old Broward County girl known as “J.E.”
Through Facebook messages, “Janet” later arranged a sexual tryst with a “wealthy friend,” who was actually Barnett.” The teen testified that she slept with Barnett, thinking she’d get $20,000 and a Rolex watch, but he ditched her without paying anything.
While in jail, prosecutors said Barnett began scheming to get rid of J.E., hiring a fellow inmate named Roman Thomas, with the plan to have one of his associates on the streets kill her on New Year's Eve 2013.
Barnett also asked Thomas to kill his defense lawyer, David Seltzer, whom he believed had failed to properly defend him, prosecutors said.
Thomas testified he never planned to follow through, and even tipped off Seltzer to Barnett’s plans.
Barnett’s former assistant, a college student named Maggie Caceres, also took the stand, helping jurors understand the coded language of jail calls between her and Barnett. Caceres, who took a plea deal for her role in Barnett’s case, admitted to making payments to Thomas’ relatives on Barnett’s behalf.
Barnett has focused his defense on blasting Thomas, a suspected pimp who himself made news when he was jailed for allegedly forcing a teen runaway to tattoo his street name on her eyelids.
He insisted none of the payments to Thomas’ relatives outside of jail were for any sort of murder plot.
Instead, Barnett painted Thomas as a bully behind bars who “got rough and tough” by repeatedly beating him up in a jail bathroom and demanding money for “protection.”
Over months, Thomas suggested he’d find a way to harm Barnett’s family, the defendant claimed, and even frame him for trying to have J.E. killed. Thomas supposed sway was so great that Barnett claimed he had to “get permission” to even entertain a plea deal in his upcoming trial.
Why didn’t Barnett just tell police or his jailers about the supposed extortion?
“I knew from my year in jail, that snitching was not the thing to do,” Barnett claimed. “Snitching was not an option.”
Prosecutors are expected to cross-examine Barnett on Monday afternoon.

Jeanine Knight would always introduce him to new guests and clients at the Simonka Place shelter.
“Do you know who this is?” she would ask. “This is George Simonka.”
When she told them his name, most recognized it right away, with eyebrows raised and mouth dropped slightly open. He was the namesake of the place they came to for hot showers, clean clothing, personal care items, nourishing meals, safe shelter and a spiritual hand.
“You would have thought he was Brad Pitt,” Knight said with a chuckle. “They knew he had a part in this. The women really developed a great respect for him.”
George Simonka was the patriarch of helping the homeless in our community, and not just at Simonka Place. He served as executive director for Union Gospel Mission for 37 years, including 35 in Salem.
“It’s amazing how many lives he touched,” said Dick Withnell, who met Simonka in 1978 when he bought a car from Withnell's dealership. “It’s a challenge for us to leave a place better than when we found it before we pass. It sounds corny, but that’s what he did.”
George Simonka died July 11 of complications from an inflamed gall bladder and kidney failure. His family said he was admitted to the hospital a week earlier with flu-like symptoms and never recovered. He was 92.
Described as a spiritual man, a humble servant, and a caretaker, Simonka had been retired for nearly three decades but never missed a chance to give testimony about how he found his way from skid row to the ministry.
Simonka earned respect from the men and women UGM served because he was one of them before he became a Christian.
He openly shared his life story, even with local newspaper reporters. Scanning the   archives, the same story was always published, sometimes with more or fewer details than the previous one.

Simonka grew up in New Jersey and worked the numbers racket before compulsive gambling landed him on the road in his early 20s. He drifted across the country, riding rails and making stops in Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Arizona.
After losing all his money gambling in Arizona, he turned to a mission for something to eat and a place to stay. When he left, someone handed him a copy of the Gospel of John, but he didn’t start reading it until he made it to Vancouver, Washington.
Sitting in a boxcar, in the spring of 1949, is where his vagabond life ended and when he was saved. He went to the UGM in Seattle, homeless and lonely, but with a full heart.
“He showed that a person who was down and out could be resurrected, and his faith was what did that for him,” said Withnell, now retired and giving back to the community.
Simonka started volunteering for UGM after getting a hand up, and then he went to California to study missionary work. That’s where he met his future wife, June. Not long after they were married in the fall of 1950, he became director of the UGM in Bellingham, Washington.
While visiting Salem, where his wife grew up and had family, he was approached about directing a new mission where free lodging, food, clothing, shelter and spiritual solace were being provided to wandering men.
Simonka took over the UGM of Salem on June 1, 1954, 12 months after it opened. He was its second director.

His wife was instrumental when the organization opened a local mission for women in 1968. The UGM bought a two-story colonial house on 14th Street NE for what was then called the Salem Women’s Home. It was one of the mission's first facilities on the West Coast exclusively for women.
In the early days, it served up to 13 women. It was renamed Simonka House in honor of George and June in 1998.
When his wife of 49 years became ill, he cared for until her death in 1999. He did the same for their daughter, Betty, before she died in 2009, and for other family members.
“When people ask me about my dad, if there’s one word I use to describe him, it’s caretaker,” said daughter Becky Burke, who lives in Salem. “My dad was always taking care of people.”
When the women’s shelter relocated to Keizer in 2002, the name was changed to Simonka Place because it was no longer in a house and could serve up to 45 women.
Today it has grown to serve more than twice that. This past Sunday night, it sheltered 100 women and children. Some stay for a few days, others for a few months.
George Simonka was a familiar face there, delivering the chapel service once a month. He often brought goodies for staff and clients, even though policy prohibited food outside the dining room.
“When your name is on the door, there are exceptions,” Knight said.

The two of them had known each other for 12 years, ever since Knight became director of the shelter. They swapped success stories about the women who came and went.
He often was recognized outside the refuge of Simonka Place, perhaps in a store or at an event. A woman would remember him or his name and share how Simonka Place saved her life.
“That was the biggest thrill for him,” daughter Becky Burke said. “Nothing made him happier than to see a woman’s life turned around.”
Simonka lived in his own home and still drove up until he was admitted to the hospital. He was an active 92-year-old who loved gardening, cooking, and fishing.
He shared his bounty from his garden, where he grew a variety of vegetables and was known for his giant pumpkins. When a garden was planned for Simonka Place, he often was the one who did the rototilling.
He cooked for others, including his specialties — pizza and chicken paprikash, a Hungarian dish from his heritage. He was best known for the treats he baked around the holidays; the star of the cookie platter was always the kifli, a Hungarian cookie made from cream cheese dough and various flavors of pastry filling.
Simonka also was known for telling jokes, always silly ones and what some would call groaners.
“Nobody groaned, but it set a less serious a tone,"" Knight said. ""When you’re working with the homeless, you’re working with people who are really hurting. It helps if you can lighten it up while still taking it seriously and working with them.”

Simonka loved people, and he was a joy for everyone to be around.
Judy Proctor, Withnell's assistant for 28 years, always enjoyed his visits to her office while his car was being serviced. She was a grateful recipient of his summer bounty and Christmas goodies, but what she will miss most are his conversations.
He always asked about her daughter and when he left her office, headed down the stairway, customarily turned and told her that he prays for her and her family every day.
“I knew with George it wasn’t just lip service,” Proctor said. “You knew he meant it.”

BREAKING NEWS: Mooch’s Wife Reportedly Files For Divorce,"Anthony Scaramucci’s wife, Deidre Ball, is filing for divorce.
Multiple sources told Page Six that Ball is divorcing Scaramucci because she has become fed up with his new lifestyle in Washington, D.C. and is over his “naked political ambition.”
Ball worked as a vice president in investor relations for SkyBridge Capital, the company that Scaramucci sold to join the White House. The pair are believed to have been married since 2014.
“Deidre has left him and has filed for divorce,” one source told Page Six. “She liked the nice Wall Street life and their home on Long Island, not the insane world of D.C. She is tired of his naked ambition, which is so enormous that it left her at her wits’ end. She has left him even though they have two children together.”
According to another source, Ball is not a fan of Trump and does not support Scaramucci’s decision to join his administration.
“I don’t know who Deidre thought she was marrying but anyone who knows Anthony knows he’s an ambitious man,” a source said.
The New Yorker’s Ryan Lizza published on Thursday an on-the-record phone call he had with Scaramucci where the new White House communications director went into an expletive-filled tirade against leakers, Reince Priebus, and Steve Bannon.",Conservative Fighters,1
Police admit deleting video of brutal arrest of innocent disabled black man,"08 Jul 2017 at 15:15 ET

A person of color living with disabilities has filed complaints against two police officers for a violent arrest without cause.
According to Pradel Content, 39, police in Laval, Quebec deleted his cell phone footage of him being violently handcuffed despite his pleas of being disabled.
In the official police report of the incident, Constable Michael Boutin confirmed that police erased video from the victim’s phone, potentially erasing evidence of misconduct.
“A disabled, black, English-speaking man has laid complaints against two Laval police officers for violently arresting him without cause and erasing a video of the incident from his cell phone,” the Montreal Gazette reported.
“I want my life back,” the victim, said at a news conference Saturday. “Let me live.”
The Centre for Research-Action on Race Relations (CRARR) “filed complaints on Content’s behalf with Quebec’s Police Ethics Commission and Human Rights and Youth Rights Commission in connection with the incident, alleging the officers used excessive force to arrest him and erased footage of the incident, which is illegal.”
Fo Niemi, executive director of CRARR, explained that while police deleted the victim’s evidence of the encounter, there was additional surveillance video which confirmed the victim’s version of events.
The victim had to “be handcuffed and placed in the police car. He cries constantly that he is handicapped,” the police report stated.

"China Just Built Another Military Base, But It Isn’t In China","Posted by Asia Mayfield | Jul 12, 2017 | National Security
China’s military is growing. Beijing recently announced plans to build a foreign military base in Djibouti, a first for the country. China will join the U.S., France, and Japan.
China’s political power is growing rapidly. The country plans to build its first foreign military base. Yesterday, two Navy warships set sail from the port of Zhangjian in preparation.
Beijing has set its sights on Djibouti, a tiny country in the Horn of Africa. Djibouti boasts a meager population of one million yet it’s nestled on the edge of one of the most important waterways in the world. France, Japan, and the U.S. have already established military bases within the country. Significant resources are expended in maintaining them.
“The US military has some 4,000 troops at Camp Lemonnier, a 100-acre base for which it signed a 10-year, $630 million lease in 2014…Elsewhere in Djibouti, the US military operates the Chabelley Airfield, from which the Pentagon stages drone airstrikes, likely into Somalia and across the Bab el-Mandeb Strait into Yemen,” CNN reports.
Djibouti officials sell land to foreign powers in exchange for cash and other valuable aid. China’s desire to firmly establish itself in Africa comes as no surprise. The Chinese have been pumping money into the continent for the past decade or more. Some even claim that Chinese operations will bring so much prosperity to Africans that the continent will soon be able to overcome its financial woes.
China’s transformation during the last century has been remarkable. The country survived massive poverty and starvation to become one of the most powerful nations in the world.
“It (China) has cited its desire to play a greater role in peacekeeping, and it has combat troops in both South Sudan and Mali. It’s logical that it needs an actual base somewhere in Africa, which is really no different from the Americans saying that they need Camp Lemonnier as a headquarters for operations in Africa, whether in peacekeeping or counter-terror or whatever,” Edward Paice, director of the London-based Africa Research Institute, said.
Bejing already has deep military ties to Djibouti. Two years ago Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to send 8,000 soldiers to the United Nations peacekeeping standby force. China also promised $1 billion to be used in the establishment of a UN Peace and Development Fund and $100 million to the African Union standby force.
“China has been deploying naval ships to waters off Somalia in the Gulf of Aden to conduct escorting missions since 2008,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang. “The completion and operation of the base will help China better fulfill its international obligations in conducting escorting missions and humanitarian assistance … It will also help promote economic and social development in Djibouti.”
Establishing a foreign military base is a sign of power. Countries that do so cement their status as world leaders. China has been in negotiations with Djibouti for years. Their presence is already felt. Chinese People’s Liberation Army-Navy troops marched in the country’s independence day parade last June.
Chinese soldiers are competent and professional. They already have a significant presence in Djibouti.
Djibouti’s value stems from its location. Its shores offer critical access to the Bab el-Mandeb straight, one of the most important waterways in the world. Millions of oil barrels are transported through the straight every single day.
“This particular piece of geography is very, very important to our strategic interests,” U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, the head of the Pentagon’s Africa Command, said in a joint appearance with U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis.
China’s increasing prominence might be a bigger threat to America’s stability than Russia. Many experts claim that China will soon be the premier superpower in the world, supplanting America. Beijing has already expressed dissatisfaction with the Trump administration. If hostilities continue, conflict may break out.
African soldiers have shown nothing but support for China’s initiatives.
“The base will ensure China’s performance of missions, such as escorting, peace-keeping and humanitarian aid in Africa and west Asia,” it said.“The base will also be conducive to overseas tasks including military cooperation, joint exercises, evacuating and protecting overseas Chinese and emergency rescue, as well as jointly maintaining security of international strategic seaways,” said State news agency Xinhua.
It will be interesting to see how the next few years play out for Beijing.",Conservative Daily Post,1
"Repeal Now, Replace Later:  Mark Levin Drops Health Insurance Truth Bomb on Eric Bolling","Repeal Now, Replace Later: Mark Levin Drops Health Insurance Truth Bomb on Eric Bolling
President Trump tweeted that if Republicans cannot pass the GOP repeal and replace bill, they need to do repeal now and replace later.
If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 30, 2017
In response, Fox News’ Eric Bolling fretted that repealing now without a replacement would cause massive disruption in health insurance coverage. Mark Levin, however, was quick to point out the obvious flaw in that argument: insurance companies, given sufficient notice, will quickly fill the void and will write policies to cover those whose coverage is disrupted by ObamaCare repeal.
Conservative Talk radio host Mark Levin debated Fox News host Eric Bolling on whether it would be better for the country and the president if the promised Obamacare repeal was postponed until after Republicans work on tax reform. The segment ran on The Specialists Friday.
“Do we see eye to eye on this?” Bolling asked.
“No.” Levin answered curtly.
“Or do you want to see something passed, Obamacare repeal immediately?” Bolling continued.
“I’ll tell you why I disagree with you,” Levin replied. “First of all, why do we keep arguing about health care in the context of what the left argues. Let’s say they repeal it. And they give them twelve months advance notice. What do you think’s gonna happen? Insurance companies are gonna create policies for 20 million people.”
“There’ll be new insurance companies that are created,” he explained. “You think they’re gonna leave that money on the table? 20 million people are gonna be on the streets and die in this country? It’ll never happen, we’re a nation of entrepreneurs. That’s number one.”
“Number two,” he continued. “Putting it off isn’t gonna fix it. You think they’re just going to easily be able to slash taxes? That’s not gonna happen.”
. . . . “The answer is not more government.” Levin responded to a later objection. “The answer to the American people is, ‘do you like liberty? Do you like to be able to see a doctor you wanna see? Do you want to see more and different types of policies that aren’t approved by the federal government?’.”
Give the free market a chance? Sounds like a great idea.

"Anthony Scaramucci, the new face of the White House, is polished, smooth and noncombative","Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images

Six months into his presidency, an embattled Donald Trump may finally have found the mouthpiece he wants — a fellow New York tycoon who gushes about his “love” for the president and blames White House woes on poor communication, not a burgeoning scandal.
Anthony Scaramucci, Trump’s new communications director, appeared confident and polished in a series of Sunday TV talk-show appearances as the White House girds for what may be a crucial week in the multiple investigations into the Trump campaign’s possible connections to Russia.
Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor, Jared Kushner, will appear behind closed doors in the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday and in the House committee on Tuesday, the first official in the Trump White House known to do so.
Lawmakers are expected to question Kushner about several hot-button issues for the FBI and the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is leading a separate criminal investigation.
They include Kushner's meeting in June 2016 with a Russian lawyer who has represented Moscow's spy service and another meeting with the then-Russian ambassador in which Kushner reportedly discussed setting up a secret back-channel communication to the Kremlin.
Scaramucci can be expected to try to turn the spotlight away from Russia, or least argue that Kushner's cooperation shows the White House has nothing to hide.
Of all the Trump surrogates trotted out in recent months, the 53-year-old former Wall Street hedge fund manager turned in a performance far smoother — and far less combative — than figures like Sean Spicer, whose awkward TV appearances were widely mocked before he quit last week rather than work for Scaramucci.
Or than Stephen Miller, the senior White House advisor who stared stone-faced into the camera in February and declared — chillingly, in critics’ eyes — that presidential authority “will not be questioned.”
During appearances on three major news talk shows, Scaramucci artfully pivoted away from troublesome topics — with a burst of candor, by changing the subject, by evoking the blue-collar roots he shares with many in Trump’s base, or just with a disarming quip.
Even amid sharp exchanges, his manner remained resolutely genial.
Are the president’s tweets a problem? No. Did Trump discuss his ability to grant pardons? Yes, but none will be needed. Does the president believe Russia meddled in the 2016 campaign? Maybe not — but Scaramucci vowed to tell Trump if he thought the president was wrong about that, or anything else.
Scaramucci repeatedly argued that the White House needs to fix its messaging and public relations operation, not its legislative agenda or its policies.
“Listen, there's obviously a communications problem,” he declared on CNN’s “State of the Union,” even while citing “phenomenal achievements” for Trump’s presidency. “I just think we need to deliver the messaging a little bit differently than we have been doing it in the past.”
He insisted that disarray inside the White House can largely be blamed on unauthorized leaks by White House staff members to the news media, which he pledged to halt, drastically if necessary.
“They’re going to get fired. I’m just going to make it very, very clear, OK? Tomorrow I’m going to have a staff meeting,” he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “And it’s going to be a very binary thing. I’m not going to make any prejudgments about anybody on that staff. If they want to stay on the staff, they’re going to stop leaking…. But if you’re going to keep leaking, I’m going to fire everybody.”
Scaramucci says he likes to use jokes to make a point, but his self-deprecating quips can land flat sometimes.
After praising the podium skills of Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who was elevated Friday to principal White House spokeswoman to replace Spicer, Scaramucci added — specifically addressing Sanders — “I loved the hair and makeup person that we had on Friday.”
After he later was slammed online for seemingly grading a subordinate by her appearance, Scaramucci quickly went on Twitter to declare he was talking about his own hair and makeup, not hers. He used the hashtag #humor.
In keeping with Trump’s own often-voiced insistence that those who work for him should look the part — he once praised the generals in his Cabinet as appearing from “central casting” — Scaramucci comes off well sartorially.
Trump had complained vociferously about an ill-fitting suit that Spicer wore for his first turn at the White House lectern, a wardrobe choice immortalized in comedian Melissa McCarthy’s skewering of Spicer on “Saturday Night Live.”
But staying on message amid a murky, slow-grinding scandal with many moving parts can be difficult. In his appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” Scaramucci casually contradicted a senior member of the president’s personal legal team, Jay Sekulow.
Sekulow said on ABC’s “This Week” that pardons were not under discussion; Scaramucci acknowledged Trump himself had recently brought up the topic.
“I'm in the Oval Office with the president last week, we're talking about that,” he said on Fox. Trump, he said, “brought that up, he said but he doesn't have to be pardoned. There's nobody around him that has to be pardoned. He was just making the statement about the power of pardons.”
Scaramucci was seemingly sanguine about the fact that anyone who speaks for Trump can quickly run afoul of the president. Trump, who spent Sunday at his Virginia golf property, is known to monitor his surrogates’ TV performances, either live or soon afterward on playback.
CNN host Jake Tapper alluded to that, telling Scaramucci after a lengthy exchange about Russia: “I love how you're talking to one specific viewer right now… the most important audience that there is.”
“I like talking to him,” Scaramucci countered. “But you know who else I'm talking to? The people I grew up with.”
The president is known to prize shows of fealty, and Scaramucci came through in spades: likening Trump to a favorite athletic coach, praising his election victory, hailing him as a “super-hard” worker, and full-throatedly denying there was anything to the Russia story.
“We're New Yorkers…. I love the guy,” he said on Fox. “He’s a great person, and he’s going to be a phenomenal – he is a phenomenal president, and he’s going to be a better president.”
But Scaramucci also acknowledged what many critics cite as the main reason Trump has consistently dismissed U.S. intelligence conclusions that Russia actively sought to help him win the White House — a belief that his political opponents are trying to tarnish his win.
“One of the reasons why he's upset about it is … the mainstream media position on this, that they [the Russians] interfered in the election,” Scaramucci said on CNN. “Actually, in his mind, what are you guys suggesting? You are going to delegitimize his victory?”
Scaramucci showed some sympathy for Trump’s attacks on what he calls “fake news,” which extends to virtually any unfavorable coverage. Scaramucci alluded to CNN’s recent withdrawal of an unsubstantiated story involving him and Russia. Three journalists subsequently resigned from the network.
But Sunday on CNN, he held out an olive branch, pledging to “soften up our relationship with the press.”

Indian Man Regrets Son’s Arranged Marriage As Bride Gets Painful Revenge On His Testicles,"July 2, 2017JodiCops & Criminals, World News
Images for the purpose of visual representation only.
An Indian man is seriously regretting his decision to allow the craziest of women to marry his son. During a family feud, which got severely out of hand, the man’s daughter-in-law grabbed his manhood and proceeded to exact her painful revenge on his testicles.
A woman in India, where arranged marriages are the norm, has admitted to squeezing her father-in-law’s testicles until they burst and killing him on the spot. Gau Kerketta had been attempting to resolve a fight between Anima Kharia and his son, Bhairaw, who were drunk and arguing after their rooster lost a cockfight. That’s when Kharia lunged at the father, grabbing his testicles in her hand like a vice.
A cockfight takes place in India, where animal rights activists have successfully fought to have the practice banned.
“The couple was probably drunk,” said police officer Ashok Kumar, according to The Sun. “The father-in-law tried to pacify them but the woman grabbed his testicles and squeezed them. The man died on the spot.” He added, “The man died of excessive bleeding. This was one of the causes mentioned in the autopsy report.”
Kharia is being held at Gumla jail as the investigation continues.
But she and her husband have dodged charges of taking part in a cockfight at a village fair in Saitola in the eastern state of Jharkhand.
The ‘sport’ is banned in the region after protests by animal-rights activists. [Source: Daily Mail]
Kharia, who is in her mid-thirties, has confessed to killing Kerketta, but maintains that it was an “accident.” Apparently, she only meant to inflict pain, not to murder the man by causing his genitals to burst. However, it is unlikely she will be able to use the “I didn’t know my own strength when I popped my husband’s dad’s nuts” defense in court.
The Gumla Jail in Jharkhand, India, where Kharia is being detained.
The family in question is from Jharkhand, India, where the cockfighting Kharia and Bhairaw were involved in is illegal, but arranged marriage is quite common. In fact, only the most progressive of Indian families will give their blessing for a union between a man and woman which has not been arranged by their respective parents.

New Huma Abedin emails reveal more donors receiving special treatment from Clinton State Dept.,"July 18, 2017 | BPR Wire | Print Article
AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File
(Washington, DC) – Judicial Watch today released 448 pages of documents from the U.S. Department of State revealing new incidents of Huma Abedin, deputy chief of staff to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, providing special State Department treatment to major donors to the Clinton Foundation and political campaigns.
The heavily redacted documents from Abedin’s non-government account include an email from Hillary Clinton’s brother, Tony Rodham, to Abedin revealing that he acted as a go-between for a Clinton Foundation donor, Richard Park. And they reveal Clinton Foundation executive Doug Band instructing Abedin to “show love” to Clinton donor Andrew Liveris.
The documents included six Clinton email exchanges not previously turned over to the State Department, bringing the known total to date to at least 439 emails that were not part of the 55,000 pages of emails that Clinton turned over to the State Department, and further contradicting a statement by Clinton that, “as far as she knew,” all of her government emails had been turned over to the State Department.
The documents are in response to a court order from a May 5, 2015, lawsuit filed against the State Department (Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:15-cv-00684)) for: “All emails of official State Department business received or sent by former Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin from January 1, 2009 through February 1, 2013 using a non-‘state.gov’ email address.”
A number of emails show the free flow of information and requests for favors between Clinton’s State Department and the Clinton Foundation.
In July 2009, in reference to the US-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, Clinton Global Initiative head Doug Band told Abedin that she “Need[s] to show love” to Andrew Liveris, the CEO of Dow Chemical. Band also asked for Liveris to be introduced to Hillary, “and have her mention both me and wjc”. Dow gave between $1 million and $5 million to the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative. Band also pushes for Clinton to do a favor for Karlheinz Koegel, a major Clinton Foundation contributor, who wanted Hillary Clinton to give the “honor speech” for his media prize to “Merkel.”
The emails reveal that on June 19, 2009, Clinton’s brother, Tony Rodham, passed a long a letter for Hillary Clinton for Clinton donor Richard Park. Park donated $100,000 to Bill Clinton as far back as 1993 and is listed by the Clinton Foundation as a $100,000 to $250,000 donor.
The Washington Examiner reported:
In March 2012, Bill Clinton received an invitation to speak at the Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea…. Richard Park’s friendship with Tony Rodham earned him a direct line to Hillary Clinton while she served as secretary of state. In January 2013, the Korean businessman sent Rodham an email and asked him to “forward this to your sister.”
On November 14, 2009, Clinton donor Ben Ringel, who has appeared in numerous prior emails asking for favors, emailed Abedin to get help in getting an Iranian woman a visa to come to the United States. He writes: “We need to get her clearance even only temporary to be with her granddaughter.” Abedin forwarded the request to Lauren Jiloty, asking her “Can U help Monday with consular affairs?” Jiloty replies, “Sure. Will look into it.” Ringel donated between $10,000 and $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation. In May, Band, working through Abedin, attempts to help Canadian concert promoter and Foundation donor Michael Cohl with the processing of a visa. Abedin passes the request to Monica Hanley, Clinton’s “confidential assistant.”
The emails show that the Clinton Foundation operative Band was involved in personnel matters at the Clinton State Department. In a May 2009 email exchange between Band and Abedin, a “career post” to East Timor for someone is discussed. Abedin explains to Band that Cheryl Mills, Hillary Clinton’s then-chief of staff, was working on the situation “under the radar.”
In August 2009, Band tells Abedin of someone who wants to be the ambassador to Barbados. Abedin replies: “I know, he’s emailed a few times. But she wants to give to someone else.”
The emails also show that Abedin received advice from her mother, Saleha Abedin (a controversial Islamist activist), on whom the Obama administration should appoint as the US Envoy to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. She notes that she has obtained a recommendation from “Hassan” (NFI), and that she’d reached out to “Ishanoglu”. This is presumably Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, a Turkish academic and the former Secretary-General of the OIC. Ihsanoglu famously called on the West to enact anti-Islamic blasphemy laws.
On Monday, June 8, Clinton emails her aide Lona Valmoro and Abedin asking to attend a cabinet meeting: “I heard on the radio that there is a Cabinet mtg this am. Is there? Can I go? If not, who are you sending?” Valmoro answers: “It is actually not a full cabinet meeting today – those agencies that received recovery money were invited to attend/participate. We were welcome to send a representative though, not sure if we have anyone going.”
Other emails found in Abedin’s unsecure email account appear to show additional instances of the Clinton State Department’s lax approach to protecting national security.
On July 4, 2009, U.S. Ambassador to Kenya Jonathan “Scott” Gration sent Abedin an email that the State Department has classified in part and redacted because the information deals with “foreign governments” and “national defense or foreign policy.” Abedin forwarded Gration’s email to her personal, unsecure email account. In his email, Gration related his meeting with Libyan president Muammar Qadafi, saying: “I conveyed our appreciation for Libya’s role to improve relations between Chad and Sudan … Leader al-Qadafi promised to continue his nation’s close collaboration with the United States … and is eager to meet you and President Obama.…” Gration would later be fired for, among other things, using personal email accounts to send government information.
A document titled “HRC PRIVATE LINE BLOCK” gives the planned whereabouts for President Obama for Thursday, June 4, 2009: “Attend POTUS Foreign Policy Speech at Cairo University.” In another example of lax concern for security, Valmoro forwarded Clinton’s detailed daily schedule for July 15, 2009, to officers of the Clinton Foundation, including Doug Band and Justin Cooper. Again, on July 26 Valmoro forwarded Hillary’s detailed, sensitive daily schedule to numerous Clinton Foundation officials.
In other examples of lax concern for security, on June 11, there is a reference to testing the “Federal preparedness and response for an international terrorist threat to the United States. [Principal-Level Exercise] will be a scenario-driven discussion for Cabinet Secretaries, agency Directors and Administrators, senior officials in the Executive Office of the President, or their approved representatives.” A document in Abedin’s unsecure email account dated May 2009 is titled “The Secretary’s Phone Call with Chinese Foreign Minister Yang” is marked sensitive but unclassified and fully redacted, as is a document titled “The Secretary’s Phone Call with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov.”
“I’m not sure how much more evidence of pay for play, classified information mishandling, and influence peddling from Clinton’s email server one would need to show a serious criminal investigation is required,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.

"PHILIPPINES: Beheaded bodies, human sex slaves and widespread looting at the hands of ISIS","Adam Garrie4 hours agoJune 28, 2017 99
President Duterte has said that he is ready for a long fight against ISIS.
President Rodrigo Duterte and his military commanders have revealed the extent of ISIS atrocities in the southern Philippine city of Marawi which is still partly controlled by the Salafist terrorist group.
Philippine troops have recently discovered 17 beheaded bodies while reports of widespread looting and human sex slavery rampant at the hands of ISIS continue to roll in from Marawi.

The Philippine military is attempting to balance the crushing of ISIS fighters in Marawi with the aim of not wanting to risk the lives of the many hostages ISIS is using as human shields in the beleaguered city.

President Duterte who has been reportedly in ill health in recent weeks gave a speech during which he stated,
“I know the deployment of snipers and where they hid their firearms. I already had the complete picture and I knew that would be a long fight”.
He continued, speaking of how ISIS is worryingly receiving many material reinforcements
“It seems to be limitless supply. They were able to stockpile their arms.
What’s painful for me, a fractured ideology entered. All that they want is to kill and destroy, how can we live with that?
Some of those who travelled to the Middle East got contaminated, brought the ideology back home and promised to declare war against humanity”.

Prior to the outbreak of ISIS violence in Philippines, Duterte had promised federalisation of the Philippines and barring that, he would grant Muslim areas in the sout of the country with autonomous rule in order to preserve the peace.
Just as was the case in Syria, Duterte has been targeted because his anti-sectarian message is incompatible with the imperial ambitions of ISIS. Duterte extended an olive branch to moderate Philippine Muslims, some of whom are members of Duterte’s extended family. ISIS saw this as a move which could crush radicalism in Philippines and moved to make war on Philippines to prevent the outbreak of peace which was becoming realistic according to Duterte’s plans.
The increased supply of weapons to ISIS terrorists in Philippines makes clear that only a naval blockade of Mindanao will be able to isolate ISIS from their illegal maritime supply routes.",The Duran,1
Clashes erupt as Palestinians declare victory over Israel in crisis over holy site,"Palestinian Muslims wave a national flag and flash the victory gesture in front of the Dome of the Rock in the Haram al-Sharif compound, known to Jews as the Temple Mount, in the old city of Jerusalem on July 27, 2017.

JERUSALEM – Palestinians declared a hard-won victory Thursday against what they saw as an attempt by Israel to limit access at their holiest site, the al-Aqsa Mosque compound.
Nearly two weeks after Israel installed metal detectors at the gates to the sensitive shrine -- a response to the killing of two Israeli police offices there by three Israeli Arab gunmen -- Israel dismantled all of the new metal detectors, cameras, scaffolding and infrastructure erected after the deadly July 14 attack.
Jerusalem’s grand mufti, Mohammed Hussein, a spiritual leader and custodian of the mosque in Jerusalem, urged Muslims on Thursday to return to their shrine for worship, declaring the crisis over.
Soon after the ban was lifted, tens of thousands of Muslim worshipers entered the mosque, chanting and celebrating. Some of the younger people climbed on top of the house of worship and put up a Palestinian flag. Within minutes, Israel forces also climbed up and tore the flag down.
Clashes followed, with reports of multiple injuries as Israeli security forces tried to gain control of the crowd at the site, which is also considered holy by Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount. Israeli police said stones were thrown at units and onto the Western Wall, the Jewish holy site that sits adjacent to the mosque complex.
“This is a message to the Israeli occupation that their arrogance failed them,” said Ibrahim Awad Allah, a top official in the Islamic Waqf, which serves as custodian of the holy site, under the control and patronage of the king of Jordan.
“Everything that has been imposed by the Israelis, all of it, has been removed,” he said, calling such a withdrawal both rare and sweet. “This is a victory.”
“This was a big miscalculation by the Israelis, who underestimated the power of the Jerusalem street, which has surprised everybody, even the Palestinian leadership,” said Abu Abad al Qaq, 49, a building contractor from Silwan in East Jerusalem, who attended the protests at the Lion’s Gate.
“The heroes are the people of Jerusalem,” Qaq said, “Now it is our mosque again. Let everyone come and pray in peace.”
Whether relative quiet returns will be seen over the next two days.
Israeli security officials said they are bracing for huge crowds on Friday at week’s end prayers at al-Aqsa, the scene for frequent clashes -- not only today, but over the decades.
Jerusalem police chief Yoram Halevi warned Palestinian protesters that his officers will respond to provocations with force.
“No one should try to test us tomorrow,” Halevi told reporters, urging calm but adding, “if there are people who try to disturb the peace, to harm police or citizens, they should not be surprised. There will be casualties and people injured.”
Israeli forces have responded to violent protest over the last two weeks with water cannons, stun grenades, rubber bullets and live ammunition.
Beginning with the Palestinian attack that left the Israeli police officers dead on July 14, the turmoil over access to the mosque has left 15 people dead, including three Israelis fatally stabbed in their home in a West Bank settlement and two Jordanians, one an alleged assailant and the other a bystander, shot by a security guard at the Israeli embassy in Amman, Jordan.
The decision by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government to back down over the increased security measures, after days of vowing the metal detectors would stay for security reasons, was seen by both Israelis and Palestinians as a capitulation.
Some said Netanyahu did the right and smart thing by de-escalating the tension, but members of his own government criticized him for what they saw as weakness in the face of Palestinian opposition and violence.
“Israel comes out weakened from this crisis,” hard-line minister Naftali Bennett said on Israel Army Radio Thursday morning. “Instead of sending a message about Israel’s sovereignty on the Temple Mount, it sent a message that Israel's sovereignty can be questioned.""
Other ministers, too, spoke often over the past 12 days about Israel’s control at the sensitive site.
At the outbreak of the crisis, Israel’s Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan said it was up to Israel to decide security protocol for the site.
Israel’s minister for national security and foreign affairs, Tzachi Hanegbi, said earlier this week in a radio interview that Israel would not give into threats at Temple Mount.
“If you are threatening us that you won’t enter the Mount, then don’t enter the Mount. Put down prayer mats and pray wherever you want. If you want to pray on the Mount, pass through the checkpoints just as I had to do at the Vatican a few weeks ago, just as we all have to at the Western Wall,” he said.
He said that Israel was the sovereign power in Jerusalem and on the Temple Mount.
But the ongoing protests, some peaceful and some violent, have challenged that.
Over the past week and a half, Palestinian Muslim worshipers have laid their prayer mats down on the street outside the mosque compound, stirring emotions in the wider Arab world and causing tensions between Israel and one of its closest Muslim allies, Jordan.
In a Facebook post Wednesday, Netanyahu vowed to shut down the Jerusalem bureau of Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based news network, for broadcasting inciting images from Jerusalem.
“The Al Jazeera network continues to incite to violence over the Temple Mount,” Netanyahu wrote on social media. “I’ve appealed several times to law enforcement demanding to close Al Jazeera’s office in Jerusalem. If this does not happen due to legal interpretation, I will work to enact the required legislation to expel Al Jazeera from Israel.”
Netanyahu’s bureau declined to give any specific examples of the Al Jazeera content that might have stoked tensions.
Asked for a specific example of Al Jazeera incitement, a communications adviser in Netanyahu’s office suggested reporters just scroll Google.
Last week, the channel published a short video clip showing an Israeli police officer kicking a Palestinian kneeling on a prayer mat for worship. Netanyahu’s office did not dispute the veracity of the clip.
It was this image and others that spurred Omar al-Abed, a 19-year-old Palestinian to stab to death three Israelis in the settlement of Halamish on Friday night, his father told The Washington Post this week.
Netanyahu called the teen a “beast,” and said he was “incited by Jew hatred.”
The gruesome attack, which left a 70-year-old Israeli grandfather and his two adult children lying in a pool of blood in the family’s kitchen, drew angry reactions from Israeli leaders, with several calling for Israel to use the death penalty. The attacker was shot but only lightly wounded.
Palestinians say the Israelis are also guilty of inciting violence.
They point to statements by Israeli parliament Oren Hazan, who posted a video on his Facebook account saying that he wanted to demolish the home of Palestinian assailant Omar al-Abed and “execute” his family.
“I want to be honest without sounding too extreme, but if it was up to me, I would’ve gone to the terrorist’s house yesterday, grabbed him and his whole family and executed them all together,” said Hazan, who is a member of Netanyahu’s Likud party.

President Donald Trump opens his two-nation European visit with what he expects to be a short but warm stop in Poland before he encounters what could be a frostier reception and thornier issues at an international summit in Germany.

WARSAW, Poland - Polish President Andrzej Duda says he will hold talks on the “very concrete issues” of security, energy and economic cooperation with visiting President Trump.
Trump arrived in Warsaw late Wednesday for a 16-hour visit that includes a keynote address to the Poles from Krasinski Square, site of a monument commemorating the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against the Nazis. Scores of people who lined darkened roads waved American and Polish flags and recorded video of Trump’s motorcade as it sped him and his wife, Melania, to their hotel.
On Thursday, he will hold talks with Duda and other leaders from the region, attending an economic summit. Trump will then deliver a public speech before traveling to a G-20 summit in Germany.
Poland’s conservative government is hailing the visit as a huge success for its diplomacy and a confirmation of its European standing.

Duda said on TVN24 that his talks with Trump will not be “some general talk about world security” but will tackle concrete issues like energy security for the region, which is still dependent on gas and oil deliveries from Russia.
The two leaders will also discuss further deliveries of U.S. liquid gas to Poland and the region. A one-time shipment arrived last month.
It may not be a formal organization, but the G20 still packs a lot of power.
Trump “sees potential benefits for the U.S. in this meeting,” Duda said.
Central and Eastern Europe still needs huge investment in its infrastructure, roads, energy grid and railroads as it works to catch up with western Europe, he said.
Duda said the visit will have a “historical” nature and Trump’s speech in a downtown Warsaw square will be “not only for Poland, but for the whole world.”
Duda’s foreign policy aide, Andrzej Szczerski, said the Polish president has two gifts for Trump: one formal, according to the protocol, and a “nice surprise gift.” He would not elaborate.

SPREAD THIS: This One-Hit Wonder Nobody Bans Trump Supporters From His Shows… Boycott Him
July 16, 2017Alex D.12 Views 0 Commentsrock
I think some people just don’t get it so many liberal sites labeled Todd Rundgren as a Rock star legend that attacked President Trump and his supporters by banning them from his concerts! There is one problem he is not a rock legend!
This one-hit wonder nobody? Can’t ban fans that would never be caught dead at one of your “concerts” in the first place! Might get enough “fans” to half-fill a corner beer joint if you’re lucky. (Most of his “fame” came in the background as a record producer.)
He is well known for his 1970’s rock hit “Hello, It’s Me” just ruined his career and the handful of fans he has left.
Rather than be thankful that anyone would give him money to see his tired ass perform, he is spitting in their faces.
I only know one of his songs. He may have had success a while back, but now, he’s just like the rest of us. I don’t think OUR President would even want to go to hear him. This is a pebble thrown compared to what OUR President faces every single day of his life.
His career was almost done now every Trump supporter will take care that is DONE! I think he ended his career by himself with this!
Rundgren out on the scene for a doomed effort, promoting his new album White Knight, did the unthinkable in a recent interview.
When Variety magazine asked Rundgren if the President and his supporters piss him off.
“No,” Rundgren answered. “If I had the power, I’d say: If you’re a Trump supporter, don’t come to my show, because you won’t have a good time. And also, I don’t understand your frickin’ values. Because I’m not singing about that. If you don’t understand that basic thing, you’re just fooling yourself.”
Nice guy huh? Can’t wait for all those empty seats at his next show.
But the clown goes further, in “Man in the Tin Foil Hate,” his new song about Donald Trump Rundgren sings:
“He’s coming down the escalator with a girl from east of here because the man in the tin foil hat is leading like a teenager girl. He puts the ‘pluto’ in plutocrat, he hasn’t got time for losers, unless they do what he demands.”

Republicans Turn Their Back On Trump Over Latest Partnership With Russia Amid Security Fears,"July 9, 2017 Economy, Media, News, Politics
?>&url;=?>ℑ=?>?w=640"" target=""_blank"" class=""socicon-twitter twurl"">
Donald Trump does not think…. at all. And this recent partnership that he purposed with Russia seems to be a true testament to that.
While Russia has been the center of the drama surrounding hackings during the 2016 election, Trump just decided that he wants to use them to help fight cyber security. The damn irony that is actually stupidity, or Trump being controlled by Russian President Vladimir Putin. It’s most likely both.

Three top Republicans, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, John McCain of Arizona and Mario Rubio of Florida, have spoken out against this ridiculous bright idea from Trump. Grahm even calling it one of the dumbest ideas he’s ever heard.
As reported by Reuters, Grahm told NBC’s “Meet The Press”,
“It’s not the dumbest idea I have ever heard but it’s pretty close.”
Adding that Trump’s apparent willingness to “forgive and forget” stiffened his resolve to pass legislation imposing sanctions on Russia.
McCain said this just shows that Putin can get away with murder in Trump’s eyes, which he probably has already. He told CBS’ ‘Face The Nation’,
“Vladimir Putin … got away with literally trying to change the outcome … of our election. Yes, it’s time to move forward. But there has to be a price to pay.”
Lastly, Rubio took his frustrations with the new Russia-Trump Duo to Twitter saying,
Partnering with Putin on a ‘Cyber Security Unit’ is akin to partnering with (Syrian President Bashar al) Assad on a ‘Chemical Weapons Unit’.
As much as liberals and conservatives may clash, one thing is for sure, Trump’s constant bad decisions are undeniable. They hurt our country. And the fact that he would think to partner with a man who criminally interfered with our elections makes him a TRAITOR!

Republican senator dismisses procedural claims on Russia sanctions bill,"Senator Bob Corker (R-TN) speaks to reporters about the Senate healthcare bill on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 29, 2017.
WASHINGTON The Republican chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee said on Monday that if the House of Representatives does not pass a Russian sanctions bill, it is because members do not want to impose new sanctions, not because of a procedural issue cited by Republican leaders in the House.
""There is no issue, except do they want to pass a Russia sanctions bill or not,"" Senator Bob Corker told reporters at the U.S. Senate.
The Senate passed the sanctions measure by 98-2 on June 15, but it has been stalled in the House, where President Donald Trump's fellow Republicans hold a larger majority than in the Senate.
House Republican leaders insisted the delay was purely because the bill violated a constitutional requirement that legislation affecting government revenues must originate in the House, not the Senate.
They also blamed Democrats for holding it up.
Democrats, and some Republicans, scoffed. They said the bill could have been fixed and passed in the House in a matter of minutes.
Trump administration officials said they disagree with provisions in the bill requiring the president to get Congress' permission before easing any sanctions, and the fact that many of the new sanctions are mandatory, so that the president cannot opt to waive them for national security reasons.
Some Republicans have also echoed concerns raised by U.S. energy firms and European governments that the legislation could complicate investment in Russian energy projects, and potentially cost industry jobs.
Corker said the bill was written to allow the Trump administration to address energy-related issues. And he said any White House would prefer to conduct foreign policy without Congress, but the administration had not asked him to kill the bill.
""No one has called me and said, 'We don't want this legislation to pass.' That has never occurred,"" Corker said.
Lawmakers and aides said administration officials had held meetings in Congress in the past few weeks to express their concerns about the measure.
The Senate passed the bill a second time by unanimous consent on June 29, with a “fix” to address the procedural issue, but it has still not been taken up by the House.
House Republicans said on Monday that the Senate change had not satisfied the procedural concern and that the Senate would have to change it and vote again.

Media: It is “Personal” when Trump Defends Himself from Our Fake News,"Written by Joe Scudder
Apparently, it is not “personal” when the media attacks him; only when Trump defends himself.
Whenever Donald Trump defends himself, the media reports on it as if they are reporting an act of aggression. Thus, the Hill’s headline, “CNN war with Trump gets personal,” is almost nonsensical. If a media corporation is at war with a sitting President, then it is already personal! But it is clear from the beginning that this war “gets personal” because the White House returned fire at CNN.
President Trump’s war with CNN took an even more personal turn on Tuesday after the White House used its press briefing to tout a hidden camera video calling the cable news network’s coverage of the Russia controversy “bullshit.”
The undercover video from conservative sting artist James O’Keefe showed a CNN producer questioning the network’s coverage and suggesting important stories had been buried to keep the focus on Trump and Russia.
At Tuesday’s press briefing, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders encouraged viewers to watch the O’Keefe video, calling it “a disgrace to all of media, all of journalism.”
She also took a dig at CNN President Jeff Zucker, saying the sensationalism and disregard for facts was “coming directly from the top.”
The press conference got personal when a media employee sharply complained about Huckabee’s statement:

The threat now lurking behind Trump's media-slamming tweets,"President Trump arrived at the U.S. Women's Open at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., on Sunday. (Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)
President Trump began his Sunday by slamming the media on Twitter before spending the afternoon at one of his golf courses and tuning in to Fox News in the evening. It was a typical weekend day, in other words.
Yet the president's tweets — which did not involve wrestling footage or a plastic surgery-related insult and therefore seemed unremarkable — could foreshadow something more intense and unusual.
Here's what Trump posted, in case you missed it:
HillaryClinton can illegally get the questions to the Debate & delete 33,000 emails but my son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media?

The ABC/Washington Post Poll, even though almost 40% is not bad at this time, was just about the most inaccurate poll around election time!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 16, 2017
A couple of reminders before we move on:
Clinton's campaign was tipped off to a question twice during the Democratic primary, once before a debate and once before a candidate forum, by Donna Brazile, who at the time was a Democratic National Committee member and a CNN analyst. Brazile's leaks were unethical but not illegal, and the disadvantaged candidate was Sen. Bernie Sanders, not Trump.
[Trump keeps misleading his voters on the Donna Brazile debate scandal]
The Washington Post-ABC News poll has an A-plus rating from FiveThirtyEight and, contrary to the president's claim, came pretty close to predicting the election result. Its final pre-election survey showed Clinton leading, 47 percent to 43 percent; Clinton won the popular vote, 48.2 percent to 46.1 percent.
Complaints about polls and unnamed sources are standard fare from @realDonaldTrump, but the president's team is plotting new, targeted attacks. In a report last week on the White House's response to news about Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer was this nugget from The Post's Philip Rucker and Ashley Parker:
“A handful of Republican operatives close to the White House are scrambling to Trump Jr.’s defense and have begun what could be an extensive campaign to try to discredit some of the journalists who have been reporting on the matter.
Their plan, as one member of the team described it, is to research the reporters’ previous work, in some cases going back years, and to exploit any mistakes or perceived biases. They intend to demand corrections, trumpet errors on social media and feed them to conservative outlets, such as Fox News.”
Recall that April Ryan, a White House correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks, reported in February that a member of the president's communications team threatened her by claiming that Ryan is one of several journalists on whom Trump officials have compiled dossiers of negative information.
[Journalist says Omarosa Manigault bullied her and mentioned a ‘dossier’ on her]
“That is absolutely not true,” White House press secretary Sean Spicer said at the next media briefing. “There are no dossiers being kept. It's just a binder that I put right here; that's about it. That was a joke.”
Perhaps it was, but we got a preview of what a dossier on a journalist might look like, during the presidential race, when former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski dug into previous work by Newsweek reporter Kurt Eichenwald and leveled a misleading charge on CNN. Lewandowski, a CNN commentator at the time, claimed that Eichenwald “has said that George W. Bush was directly involved with 9/11. He has no credibility.”
As I wrote then, “Eichenwald was highly critical of Bush's response to intelligence. But he certainly did not accuse the former president of being 'directly involved with 9/11.'”
Lewandowski's attack was prompted by Eichenwald's reporting on potential conflicts of interest presented by the Trump Organization's foreign interests. The strategy was clear: cast aspersions on the journalist's old reporting to make his new reporting appear suspect.
It's not clear if that strategy is in play here, but Trump's accusatory tweets take on a different significance if his team executes on the plan described in The Post's reporting.",Washington Post – Politics,0

ROK Navy Receives New Advanced Attack Submarine,"The Republic of Korea took delivery of a new diesel-electric attack submarine on July 10.
The Republic of Korea (ROK) Navy took delivery of the sixth Son Won II-class (Type 214) diesel-electric air-independent propulsion (AIP) attack submarine on July 10, according to the Defense Acquisition Program Administration.
The handover ceremony of the new 1,800-ton submarine, christened Yu Gwan-sun, took place at the South Korean defense contractor Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering (DSME) shipyard in Geoje Island, near the port city of Busan in the southeastern part of South Korea.
The new Son Won II-class (also known as KSS II–class) sub –a domestic license-built variant of the Type 214 submarine build by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft in Germany — is expected to be commissioned at the end of the year.

“The Yu Gwan-sun is the world’s top-class diesel-powered submarine capable of handling more than 300 underwater targets at the same time,” Choi Hee-kyung, a DAPA official in charge of the program, was quoted as saying, according to Yonhap news agency. “Equipped with a fuel battery system, it can conduct underwater operations for 10 days or longer without surfacing above the water.”
The sub, powered by two MTU Friedrichshafen diesel engines and fitted with an air-independent propulsion system built around Siemens polymer electrolytic membrane fuel cells, can be armed with long-range submarine-to-ground cruise missiles, anti-ship cruise missiles, heavyweight anti-ship torpedoes, and naval mines.
As I explained previously, the ROK Navy expects to operate a fleet of nine Son Won II-class boats alternatively assembled by DSME and Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI):
The recent launch is part of a three-phased naval construction program to build up the ROKN attack submarine force. South Korea currently operates a fleet of nine 1,200-ton Chang Bogo-class diesel-electric attack submarines – a variant of the German Type 209 boat. Under the first phase, the ROKN is planning to upgrade all nine Chang Bogo-class submarines with air-independent propulsion and flank-array sonars over the next few years.
The nine Son Won II-class vessels are part of the second phase of the ROKN’s so-called Korean Attack Submarine program. The third and final phase (and also the most ambitious part of the project) will be the construction of nine indigenously produced 3,000-ton diesel-electric attack submarines – designated KSS-III – equipped with air-independent propulsion and multiple vertical launch tubes from which Hyunmoo-3C cruise missiles with a range of up to 1,500 kilometers can be fired.
Last month, HHI announced that it began work on the third 3,000-ton KSS-III attack submarine, with two other subs of the class currently being assembled by DSME.

July 17, 2017 5:00 AM
 
One big reason Senate Republicans are having trouble uniting around a plan to overhaul the nation’s health coverage is that a lot of them just don’t get along.
These intra-party clashes of personality and policy stymie the bill’s progress as much as any other political force. Sure, lawmakers are reluctant to side with President Donald Trump, particularly in traditional swing states such as Ohio or Wisconsin. And waiting in the House are conservatives who are wary of the latest Senate plan, crafted to win over centrists.
But what’s hurting the Senate’s effort to come together are the personal relationships. Or lack of them.
Sen. Pat Roberts, who was involved in drafting both versions of the Senate health care bill, said he hasn’t spoken to his fellow Republican senator from Kansas, Jerry Moran, about why Moran hasn’t gotten on board yet.
Moran’s vote is crucial, since he’s regarded as one of six undecided Republicans. Two GOP senators, Maine’s Susan Collins and Kentucky’s Rand Paul, are opposed to the legislation unveiled Thursday, meaning one more defection dooms the bill. Republicans control 52 Senate seats.
It would make sense that Roberts, a veteran lawmaker and powerful agriculture committee chairman serving his fourth term, would try to persuade his younger colleagues.
But he’s struggling with Moran. “No. Between you and me and the fence post, I’m trying to get a better word than no, but that’s where it is,” Roberts told the Kansas City Star. “Quite frankly, I think the best thing to do is to ask Jerry.”
Told that a reporter hadn’t been able to track Moran down on Capitol Hill, Roberts quipped, “Imagine that.”
This sort of cool relationship between a state’s senators is hardly unusual. Moran might be trying to come out of Roberts’ shadow by splitting with Roberts and GOP leadership on health care, said Wendy Schiller, a professor of political science at Brown University who wrote Partners and Rivals: Representation in U.S. Senate Delegations.
“This, to me, is Jerry Moran’s move,” she said. “He clearly wants to establish himself as an independent force in Kansas politics.”
If tension already exists between lawmakers, really tough votes are going to aggravate the situation, said Darrell West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, a research group.
“They’re very high profile, there’s a lot of public press on various points of views on the issue, and it’s just going to make the whole situation much worse,” West said.
“You would think there would be more conversations taking place within the delegation,” he said, “but sometimes it doesn’t happen because the issue’s very hot.”

Cruz supports revised GOP health care bill with his amendment attached
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas said on July 13, 2017 that he will now vote ""yes"" after his amendment creating a fund to help insurers cover people with higher medical costs was added to the Senate health care bill.
The math on health care is tough for the GOP, a fact that even Trump acknowledged in a conversation with reporters on Air Force One recently.
“It’s like this narrow road that about a quarter of an inch wide,” the president said of the difficulty of getting Republicans to agree. “You get a couple here and you say, great, and then you find out you just lost four over here. Health care is tough.”
That’s the challenge for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky; Roberts wants to curb the rising costs of Medicaid, the joint federal-state program that helps pay health care for lower income consumers, and Moran doesn’t want Medicaid slashed too much.
Other states have similarly split delegations.
McConnell can’t convince his own home state Republican colleague, Sen. Rand Paul, to join him in supporting the bill. Paul says it doesn’t keep Republicans’ promise to repeal Obamacare because it keeps many of the law’s regulations and subsidies.
Paul, who has lashed out at McConnell for not negotiating with his office before releasing a draft of the health care bill, said the only way to get all 52 Republican senators to agree on health care is to split the bill in two: One that repeals Obamacare, and another involving all the regulations and funds to stabilize the market. McConnell isn’t likely to agree.
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, heads the Senate Finance Committee, a major player in getting the legislation through the Senate. His junior colleague, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, is considered an undecided. He wants to repeal Obamacare provisions that prevent insurance companies from charging more to cover people with pre-existing conditions.
EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE
Add to all this Republican governors weighing in, too, trying to strong arm their states’ senators to vote one way or another. On Friday, as Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, wavered on whether to support the latest Senate bill, Gov. John Kasich, a Republican and close political ally, slammed it as “still unacceptable.”
“Here’s the problem: You’re not going a bill passed in Washington that Republican governors don’t like,,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.
“We’ve got a really big mess,” acknowledged Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. “We come from different states. Some expanded, some didn’t. There’s a host of reasons. There’s just nothing easy about this.”

The best part about all this is that the woman who told Waters these cold hard truths was a fellow Black Woman. I really hope this woman runs against her. From the looks at how the people of Inglewood have woken up lately, she might actually beat her.

As you can see it 2017 hasn’t turned out to be a very good year for the good auntie.
Maxine Waters: A Gift That Keeps Giving
Congresswoman Maxine Waters failed to anticipate her “destroy Trump” campaign would have an unpleasant boomerang effect on her own political career.
She experienced an unwanted surprise this week when returning to her posh home in Hancock Park after making the media rounds in the so-called impeachment campaign against President Trump.
Protestors had gathered outside her LA mini-mansion waving placards that read: “Impeach Maxine Waters” and “Do Your Job,” referring to the congresswoman’s 35-year tenure representing the infamous suburb of Compton. “She’s not representing her constituents, especially the black constituents,” complained one of the protestors before the KABC media crew. “She thinks by putting down our president, we’re going to like her more,” complained another protestor. “Every time she talks, she makes me want to throw up.” That can’t be good for her re-election chances.
Not all was doom-and-gloom on the scene. There was even a mariachi band that allowed the gathering to protest in style.
Apparently, Waters is too distracted as the new media darling — dubbed “Auntie Maxine” by fawning reporters — to perform her job. Her long history of corruption and abysmal performance in office never seems to make its way into the conversation among her co-conspirators (aka reporters) in the mainstream media.
It is a perverse irony that President Trump works round-the-clock to make inroads to improve the lives of Americans in his few months in office, and Waters with a whopping 35 years on the job continues representing a district where the socioeconomic conditions grow progressively worse.
Perhaps that’s the reason one of the protestors suggested withholding the congresswoman’s salary by waving a sign that read: “No Justice No Paycheck.” Here’s what they are so mad about: Compton is now more than $40 million awash in debt; produces schools dubbed “dropout” factories, has lost accreditation of its community college; and widespread gang violence resulted in the 43rd district being listed as the most dangerous place for homicides in Los Angeles County, according to the Los Angeles Daily News.
To be fair, Compton retains the distinction of being the birthplace to the only bulletproof drive-thru funeral home. (I’m sure the proprietor has his or her reasons.)
No wonder Waters cannot be expected to live in the district she represents. It’s too dangerous. She’s safely ensconced approximately 20 miles away, but everyone knows that a change in Southland zip codes can translate to mean living worlds apart.
As for her history of corruption, Waters will argue to the death — or at least wear you out — that the three-year congressional ethics committee investigating her diversion of bailout money to her husband’s bank, OneUnited, (in which he was a stockholder and board member) was made up of a racist cabal orchestrated by the Red State (given new meaning today). The congresswoman’s influence peddling in real estate finance also caught the attention of the IRS labeling the transactions as a “scam,” according to the agency’s 2006 report.
All things considered, President Trump could not ask for a better adversary than Waters. She talks a lot about connecting the dots between Putin and Trump through baseless allegations, misstatement of facts and fanning the media-induced smoke in hopes of igniting a fire. Her own words best make her case in which she deserves an additional moniker as the “Queen of Malapropisms.”
“The fact that he (President) is wrapping his arms around Putin,” she alleged at a recent press conference, “While Putin is continuing to advance into Korea.” The congresswoman knew something was off in her statement as she looked somewhat confused, but this did not stop her from repeating the Korea allegation. “Crimea,” whispered a concerned liberal standing behind her. Let’s be clear: Putin invaded the Crimea, and not North or South Korea.
Should we give Auntie Maxine a pass because both words contain the same number of syllables. Then she would earn the same pass for referring to the President’s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, as “Mike Priebus.”
It appears her liberal friends are more forgiving of her mangled messages, but not so understanding of her corruption. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a liberal group supported by George Soros, drew up a list of “the most corrupt members of Congress,” and Auntie Maxine was among the Hall of Shamers.
These are supposed to be her liberal friends.
Throughout the congresswoman’s 13 terms in office, she has acquired a long history of shameful conduct and baseless allegations dating back to the 1990s: She accused the CIA of deliberately distributing “crack cocaine to young blacks” in the inner cities and paid a courtesy visit to the parents of the black youth who randomly selected a white person (pulled from his truck) to bash his head with a cement block in an LA race riot in 1992. The parents of the innocent truck driver, Reginald Denny, did not receive the same courtesy visit. These acts of violence were dubbed by Waters as “somewhat understandable” at the time. Therefore she said: “So I call it a rebellion.” She’s on to her next “resistance” movement.
Congresswoman Waters is the perfect face, now named as the “Auntie of the Resistance,” to best reflect the shameful character and perverse nature of the campaign to destroy the majority government now in power.
The people of Inglewood California have finally woken up. They now see they live in a third world-like cesspool of unemployment, homelessness, and crime. They have been voting for the same Democrat Party elitist hacks for decades and all they have gotten is the same old crap. Congresswoman Waters doesn’t even live in her own district because she is afraid of the crime and gang activity there. But has she ever done anything to alleviate the problem? Not a thing. And her constituents are finally starting to take notice and want to do something about it. Better late than never!
Please share if you want to see Maxine Waters voted out of office….

"Trump's budget would mean a $720-billion deficit over 10 years, Congressional Budget Office says","Pablo Martinez Monsivais / Associated Press
President Donald Trump's budget would likely result in a $720-billion deficit in 10 years, according to a Congressional Budget Office report.

A government analysis of President Trump's budget plan says it wouldn't come close to balancing the federal ledger like the White House has promised.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office this week says that Trump's budget, if followed to the letter, would result in a $720-billion deficit at the end of 10 years instead of the slight surplus promised.
The CBO says Trump's budget would reduce the deficit by a total of $3.3 trillion over 10 years instead of the $5.6-trillion deficit cut promised by the White House. The nonpartisan scorekeeper estimated that deficits in each of the coming 10 years will exceed the $585 billion in red ink posted last year.
The CBO says that Trump relies on economic growth predictions that are far too optimistic and that those rosy projections are the chief reason his budget doesn't balance as promised.
""Nearly all of that [deficit] difference arises because the administration projects higher revenue projections — stemming mainly from a projection of faster economic growth,"" the CBO said.

Trump's budget predicts that the U.S. economy will soon ramp up to annual growth in gross domestic product of 3%; the CBO's long-term projections predict annual GDP growth averaging 1.9%.
""The CBO report shows that the president built his budget on fantasy projections,"" said Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
Trump's May budget submission proposed jarring, politically unrealistic cuts to the social safety net for the poor and a swath of other domestic programs. Many of its recommendations were deemed dead on arrival and are being ignored by Republicans controlling Congress.
President Trump in his first full budget says he will produce a surplus in a decade, though his fiscal pathway relies on projections of growth more optimistic than government and private-sector economists expect and deep cuts in anti-poverty programs such as Medicaid.
The budget to be released...

The budget to be released...
The CBO also said the Trump budget contained too little detail to accurately predict its effects on the economy. The White House promised that its juiced-up economic projections would produce $2.1 trillion in deficit reduction, mostly from overhauling the tax code and reducing the burden regulations have on the economy. But Trump's tax overhaul plan at this point is so rough that it can fit on a single page.
The analysis came as the administration and Republicans controlling the House are struggling to unite the GOP behind an alternative congressional budget plan that's a prerequisite for a hoped-for tax reform effort this fall.
The stakes on completing a budget are high for the Trump administration. Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said Thursday that the administration's plans to cut taxes hinges on completing a 2018 budget, a procedural requirement so that the tax cuts can be passed without having to rely on Democratic support in the Senate.
""The tax reform concepts rely almost entirely on the budget resolution passing,"" Mulvaney said at a breakfast with reporters.
Mulvaney said that discussion was continuing among House lawmakers about fashioning a package of cuts from so-called mandatory programs that can win support from both conservative and centrist Republicans.
But he was quick to downplay calls for an aggressive timeline on the administration's agenda. He said it was unreasonable to expect Congress to raise the government's borrowing authority, replace the 2010 health insurance law and pass a 2018 budget in the ""next couple of weeks."" Mulvaney said the priority was to complete the GOP's rewrite of healthcare first.
The CBO is the nonpartisan scorekeeper charged with giving lawmakers independent analysis of legislation, the budget and the economy. While the White House and many Republicans have criticized the CBO's coverage estimates for the Obamacare health law and the House and Senate GOP replacement plans, the White House hasn't been critical of the CBO's budget predictions.
""While it does very well at times predicting things on budget — whether it's revenue or spending, we don't always agree that it does a great job predicting [healthcare] coverage,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters last month.
On Thursday, the White House budget office took heart that the CBO had credited it with $4.2 trillion worth of spending cuts over the upcoming decade, including $1.9 trillion from healthcare programs. The CBO also said the administration would cut taxes by almost $1 trillion over that time, mostly because of its plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
The deficit cuts may come up short of balance, but the White House noted they are still very ambitious.
""We are thrilled that CBO confirms that the president's proposed budget resulted in the largest deficit reduction they have ever scored. CBO agrees that this is the largest deficit reduction package in American history,"" said White House budget office spokeswoman Meghan Burris, promising that Trump's economic agenda ""will jump-start the economy.""

New York designer pleads guilty in scam tied to ex-U.N. chief's relatives,"NEW YORK A New York fashion designer who has called himself the ""curator of cool"" pleaded guilty on Wednesday to charges stemming from a bribery case that involves a brother and nephew of former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.
Self-described arts and fashion consultant and blogger Malcolm Harris, 53, entered his plea to money laundering and wire fraud before U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos in federal court in Manhattan, U.S. prosecutors said.
Harris is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 27. His lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment.
Harris was charged in January with agreeing to act as a middleman in an international bribery scheme involving a potential $800 million international real estate deal, and then running off with his co-conspirators' money.
Also charged were Ban Ki-moon's brother Ban Ki-sang, who was an executive at South Korean construction firm Keangnam Enterprises Ltd, and Ban Ki-sang's son Joo Hyun ""Dennis"" Bahn, a real estate broker.
Ban Ki-moon was long expected to make a bid for the presidency of South Korea, but announced in February that he would not run, citing ""fake news.""
According to an indictment filed in New York federal court, Ban Ki-sang arranged for Keangnam to hire his son to broker a refinancing on the Landmark 72 building complex in Hanoi, which cost over $1 billion to construct, to help the company deal with a liquidity crisis.
In March 2013, Bahn, through an acquaintance, met Harris, who has counted Madonna among his famous friends. According to celebrity TV show Access Hollywood, he has also sold dresses to Angelina Jolie.
Harris told Bahn that he could help get a deal via his connections, which he said included members of a Middle Eastern royal family, and offered to bribe an official to arrange the Landmark 72's sale to a sovereign wealth fund, according to prosecutors.
In April 2014, Bahn and Ban Ki-sang agreed to pay an upfront $500,000 bribe and another $2 million upon the sale's closing to the official, with Harris acting as middleman, prosecutors said.
They said Harris had no actual connection to the official, however, and kept the $500,000 for himself.
He spent the money on airfare, hotels, lavish meals, furniture, rent for a Manhattan apartment and a six-month lease for a penthouse in the fashionable Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg, according to the indictment.
Bahn has pleaded guilty, and Ban Ki-sang remains at large, according to prosecutors.

Brazil Supreme Court justice sends charge against president to Congress,"Brazilian President Michel Temer during press statement, at Planalto Palace in Brasilia, Brazil June 27, 2017.
Brazilian President Michel Temer speaks during press statement, at Planalto Palace in Brasilia, Brazil June 27, 2017.
BRASILIA A Brazilian Supreme Court justice sent a corruption charge against President Michel Temer to Congress on Wednesday, advancing the process under which the center-right leader could be removed from office to face trial for graft.
The justice, Edson Fachin, rejected an argument made by Brazil's top federal prosecutor that the Supreme Court should hear preliminary arguments on the charge and its merits for 15 days, before deciding whether to send it to the lower house of Congress.
Under Brazilian law, it is now up to the House of Deputies to decide whether to allow the Supreme Court to try Temer, who replaced impeached leftist President Dilma Rousseff last year. Two-thirds of the lower house must vote against Temer for his trial to occur.
The president was charged this week with arranging to receive 38 million reais ($11.55 million) in bribes from executives at JBS SA, the world's largest meat processor. [nL1N1JN1VN]
Temer branded the charge a ""fiction"" in a nationally televised address on Tuesday, even as he acknowledged that it could hurt the economy and hamper his government's plans for far-reaching reforms to help lift Latin America's biggest country out of a historic recession.
The Brazilian leader has repeatedly said he is innocent of any wrongdoing and has rejected calls from the opposition to resign. [nL1N1JO1SL]. He is caught up in a three-year anti-graft push by investigators that has revealed stunning levels of corruption in Latin America's largest country.
The schemes involve businesses paying billions of dollars in bribes to politicians and executives at state-run companies in return for winning contracts and various political favors.
Temer, one-third of his cabinet, four past presidents and dozens of lawmakers are either on trial, facing charges or under investigation for corruption. Over 90 people have been found guilty so far.
More corruption charges are expected to be made against Temer by Prosecutor General Rodrigo Janot in the coming weeks. Each of those charges will require a vote by the full lower house on whether or not the president should face trial.
A vote on the first charge against Temer is expected to take place in three to four weeks.
If less than two-thirds of the house were to vote against the charge, it would be shelved. If two-thirds approved it, it would then go back to the Supreme Court, to decide whether it will take up the case.
Temer would immediately be suspended from office for 180 days if the court accepts the case, during which time House Speaker Rodrigo Maia would take the presidency.
Were Temer to be found guilty, Congress would appoint a caretaker president to serve out his term, which ends on Jan. 1, 2019.

"New Girl Scout badges focus on cyber crime, not cookie sales","21 Jun 2017 at 12:57 ET
Girl scouts smiling holding boxes of cookies - (Girl Scouts of America)
Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story!
Cookie sales may take a back seat to fighting identity theft and other computer crime now that Girl Scouts as young as 5 are to be offered the chance to earn their first-ever cyber security badges.
Armed with a needle and thread, U.S. Girl Scouts who master the required skills can attach to their uniform’s sash the first of 18 cyber security badges that will be rolled out in September 2018,Girls Scouts of the USA said in a press release.
The education program, which aims to reach as many as 1.8 million Girl Scouts in kindergarten through sixth grade, is being developed in a partnership between the Girl Scouts and Palo Alto Networks (PANW.N), a security company.
The goal is to prevent cyber attacks and restore trust in digital operations by training “tomorrow’s diverse and innovative team of problem solvers equipped to counter emerging cyber threats,” Mark McLaughlin, chief executive officer of Palo Alto Networks, said in the release.
The move to instill “a valuable 21st century skill set” in girls best known for cookie sales is also aimed at eliminating barriers to cyber security employment, such as gender and geography, said Sylvia Acevedo, the CEO of the Girl Scouts of the USA.
Women remain vastly underrepresented in the cyber security industry, holding just 11 percent of jobs globally, according to a recent study by (ISC)2, an international nonprofit focused on cyber security.
“In our increasingly tech-driven world, future generations must possess the skills to navigate the complexities and inherent challenges of the cyber realm,” Acevedo said in the release.
“From arming older girls with the tools to address this reality to helping younger girls protect their identities via internet safety, the launch of our national cyber security badge initiative represents our advocacy of cyber preparedness,” she said.

* In Alabama’s U.S. Senate special election, Rep. Mo Brooks (R) has vowed to oppose Mitch McConnell as the Senate Majority Leader if he’s elected to the chamber. Brooks called McConnell “the head of the swamp of the U.S. Senate.” The special election primary is Aug. 15.

World's Largest Tuna Company Finally Commits to Sustainable Fishing and Worker Protection,"Major victory took two years of relentless campaigning and pressure from hundreds of thousands of concerned consumers across the globe.
July 11, 2017, 12:50 PM GMT
Greenpeace activists submit a petition with over 680,000 signatures to Thai Union in Bangkok on June 2, 2017, calling on the company to commit to positive changes for the oceans and workers at sea.
Photo Credit: Panumas Sanguanwong/Shutterstock
It took two years of relentless campaigning and nearly 700,000 concerned people from around the world, but today we are sharing the good news that together we convinced the world’s largest tuna company to clean up its act.
Tuna giant Thai Union, which owns brands such as John West, Chicken of the Sea, Petit Navire, Mareblu and Sealect, has committed to a series of changes to its business that will help to protect seafood workers, reduce destructive fishing practices, and increase support for more sustainable fishing.
This marks a major shift for the corporation, and sends a signal to the entire fishing industry to do better for the oceans and seafood industry workers.
How did this happen?
As the world’s biggest tuna producer, one in five cans of tuna sold globally are canned by Thai Union. Greenpeace’s global campaign to transform the tuna industry has included targeting its brands for several years through tuna rankings, along with assessments of foodservice companies, supermarkets, and other brands supplied by the company.
Almost two years ago, we launched a global campaign, calling on Thai Union to bring the tuna industry out of the shadows where a cycle of overexploitation, devastation and appalling labor practices flourish in the name of profit.
Alongside our allies, unions, concerned members of the public and our supporters, we pushed the company toward a brighter future for our oceans, seafood workers and ocean-dependent communities.
From our ships on the high seas, to supermarkets, industry conferences, and company headquarters, thousands of people including massive labour unions and human rights organizations joined our call for Thai Union to source more sustainably and responsibly.
Together, we pushed companies supplied by Thai Union to sell better products and commit to policies that help workers and our oceans, including tackling practices like transshipment that fuel illegal activity and human rights abuses.
So how has Thai Union changed?
Thanks to the mounting pressure, starting immediately, the company will begin making the following changes across its global business.
Reduce fish aggregating device (FAD) use by an average of 50 percent, and double supply of verifiable FAD-free caught fish globally by 2020. FADs are floating objects that create mini ecosystems and result in the catch and killing of many marine species, including sharks, turtles, and juvenile tuna.
Shift significant portions of longline caught tuna to best practice pole and line or troll caught tuna by 2020 and implement strong requirements in place to help reduce bycatch. Longline vessels are known for catching and killing non-target species like seabirds, turtles, and sharks.
Extend its current moratorium on at-sea transshipmentacross its entire global supply chain unless strict conditions are met by suppliers. Transshipment at sea enables vessels to continue fishing for months or years at a time and facilitates illegal activity.
Ensure independent observers are present on all longline vessels transshipping at sea to inspect and report on potential labour abuse, and ensure human or electronic observer coverage across all tuna longline vessels it sources from. Much of the abuse that plagues fishing vessels takes place out of sight without authorities to report to.
Develop a comprehensive code of conduct for all vessels in its supply chains to help ensure workers at sea are being treated humanely and fairly, beginning in January 2018.
An audit will be conducted by an independent third party next year to measure progress, and in the meantime, we will all be watching and waiting for positive results.
Calling on other major tuna buyers
Thai Union cannot and should not be taking this on alone. Not only will the vessels catching the fish need to fully cooperate for these commitments to turn into real action and positive change, but all major buyers and sellers of tuna need to recognize that the status quo is no longer acceptable.
Supporting more sustainable and socially responsible fisheries, particularly those that are small-scale, is an essential part of any sound tuna sourcing policy. Customers should not have to choose between bad or better, all tuna should be responsibly-caught to help address the oceans’ overfishing crisis.
Thai Union’s commitment is not the end of the story to transform the fishing industry, but the continuation of a growing movement to stop out of control companies from wreaking havoc on ocean ecosystems and people’s lives. We need to continue to hold companies accountable and all do our part to reduce the threats to our oceans.
Want to help protect our oceans and push for better tuna fisheries? Urge your favourite brand or supermarket to ensure it’s sourcing more responsibly-caught tuna, avoid brands poorly rated in Greenpeace’s tuna rankings, eat less tuna to help struggling populations to recover, and when in doubt, choose vegan “tuna”- yes, that’s a thing!

Austria bars Turkish economy minister over rally plans,"Vienna – Austria said Monday it had barred Turkish Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci from entering the country to attend a rally marking the anniversary of last year’s failed coup attempt in Turkey.
“He has been barred because his visit was not planned as part of a bilateral exchange, but was about his public appearance at an event marking the coup attempt,” foreign ministry spokesman Thomas Schnoell told AFP.
Zeybekci’s attendance would have represented a “danger for public order”, he said.
The foreign ministry did not say when the rally was due to take place.
The move came three days after the Dutch government warned Turkey against sending its deputy premier, Tugrul Turkes, to address a rally in the eastern Netherlands this week to mark the abortive coup.
Ties between Ankara and the European Union have been strained over the crackdown that followed the July 15 2016 attempted coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Bronx Teen Blasts “F*ck the Police” During Funeral of Slain Officer,"Written by Keely Sharp
It is a tragic week in New York City after a female NYPD officer was ambushed and assassinated as she sat in her police car.
The mother of three was simply doing her job, her duty as a police officer, as she worked to keep the streets safer for her city and for her children. However, an anti-cop thug decided that he was going to show the police force a message and took Miosotis Familia’s life with a gunshot to the head.
Her funeral was somber and people showed up to pay their dues to the slain officer. However, not everyone nearby was showing the respect that she deserved.
Julien Rodriguez, a 16-year-old child said he found it “satisfying” because his best friend and older brother were killed by police. I wonder if they were killed in the midst of them breaking the law….
He rudely stated, “Since they did not show respect for my brother and my friend, why should I show respect to them?”

Breitbart reports that there were about 20 officers walked over and asked him to stop the music. He did not apologize until the building superintendent reportedly threatened to evict him and his family from their home.
However, he made it clear that he ONLY apologized because of that. He said, “I apologized because it was between the house and apologizing.”
However, the teen did say he felt sorrow over the death of Miosotis Familia.
“I feel sympathy for that, because all she was trying to do was take bad people off the street,” he said. “It was wrong because she did not do anything wrong but at the same time, my bro and my best friend died for no reason.”
Rodriguez provided The Post with the names of both his brother and his best friend, whom he claims were killed, but The Post could not find any public records of their deaths.
During the funeral proceedings, hundreds of NYPD police officers also expressed their anger at New York Mayor Bill de Blasio by turning their backs days after he decided to skipa ceremony for 524 new NYPD cops so he could catch a flight to Hamburg in order to protest Donald Trump.

Somali refugees regret returning home from Kenya,"Baidoa (Somalia) – As a teenager, Aden Hussein chose to become a refugee to get an education.
With Somalia in collapse, he left his family for neighbouring Kenya where Dadaab, one of the largest and oldest refugee camps in the world, offered a de-facto city served by the UN and dozens of aid agencies.
“There I had free education,” he told AFP.
Last August, six years after arriving, Hussein, now 21, took advantage of a repatriation package offered to Somali refugees when the Kenyan government said it would close the camp.
Hussein said he was given $400 (355 euros) and promised healthcare, shelter and schooling — the same benefits he enjoyed in Dadaab.

Donald Trump Junior and the Russian lawyer: non story and possible sting,"Analysis, Latest, News, Report Russia
 
Alexander Mercouris5 hours agoJuly 12, 2017 108
Whilst the story of Donald Trump Junior's dealings with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya is tangled, the facts show no evidence of any wrongdoing on his part. On the contrary he is the only person who can be shown to have acted straightforwardly and honestly in the whole affair.
A consistent pattern of the Russiagate affair is that the New York Times or the Washington Post “expose” what is presented as some dark and terrible twist to the story of Donald Trump’s connections to Russia.
The rest of the news media and the Democrats in Congress following up by greeting the “revelation” with a mixture of enthusiasm and feigned horror.
The days and weeks pass, it turns out that nothing of importance has been “exposed” and that the “revelation” is not so dark or terrible after all.
At that point it quietly drops out of the news.
This has happened with the telephone conversation between ambassador Kislyak and General Flynn, the meeting between ambassador Kislyak and Geoff Sessions, the meeting between ambassador Kislyak and Jared Kushner (when they supposedly discussed setting up a backchannel), and the conversations between President Trump and former FBI Director James Comey.
The latest “revelation” of the meeting between Donald Trump Junior and lawyer Natalia Veselntiskaya on 9th June 2016 is a further example.
The outline of the story can be reconstructed in detail from the emails that Donald Trump Junior published earlier today. They show that the meeting was set up at the instigation of a British pop music presenter called Rob Goldstone.
On 3rd June 2016 Goldstone wrote to Donald Trump Junior the following email
Emin [Agalarov, a Russian pop star represented by Goldstone] just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting.
The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras [a Moscow-based developer who tried to partner with Trump in a hotel project] this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary [Clinton] and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.
This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr Trump – helped along by Aras and Emin.
What do you think is the best way to handle this information and would you be able to speak to Emin about it directly?
I can also send this info to your father via Rhona [presumably Rhona Graff, Trump’s longtime executive assistant], but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first.
Donald Trump Junior replied on the same day as follows
Thanks Rob I appreciate that. I am on the road at the moment but perhaps I just speak to Emin first. Seems we have some time and if it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer. Could we do a call first thing next week when I am back?
Several emails followed but the only one of interest is a further email sent to Donald Trump Junior by Rob Goldstone on 7th June 2016. It reads as follows
Hope all is well. Emin asked that I schedule a meeting with you and the Russian government attorney who is flying over from Moscow for this Thursday. I believe you are aware of the meeting – and so wondered if 3pm or later on Thursday works for you? I assume it would be at your office.
There are a number of oddities about Goldstone’s emails which I will come to shortly. However here it is merely important to note the following:
(1) there is no reference in these emails to hacking whether of the DNC ‘s or of John Podesta’s computers or of computers belonging to anyone else;
(2) Donald Trump Junior is being led to believe that the Russian government is offering to provide the Trump campaign with official documents – which must mean official Russian government documents – detailing Hillary Clinton’s dealings with Russia.
(3) there is no suggestion that this help would be provided covertly or secretly. On the contrary since what is supposedly being offered are official Russian government documents it would be impossible to deny the source if this information was going to be used.
The meeting with Veselnitskaya duly took place on 9th June 2016. It turned out that she had no information about Hillary Clinton to offer and was not a “Russian government attorney”. Instead she wanted to discuss the Magnitsky Act, upon which a baffled Donald Trump Junior politely showed her the door.
That is the unanimous account of all the participants of the meeting including Donald Trump Junior and Veselnitskaya herself. All agree that the meeting lasted no more than 20 minutes.
There is no evidence that contradicts their account and the absence of any follow-up to the meeting essentially corroborates their account.
It seems that Donald Trump Junior and Veselnitskaya have never met since and have had no further contact with each other.
There is no evidence here of any crime or wrongdoing being committed or – contrary to what many are saying – of any intention to commit one.
What Donald Trump Junior was offered was official documents supposedly provided by the Russian government which would expose Hillary Clinton as a hypocrite in light of her dealings with Russia. At a time when Donald Trump was already being criticised for wanting a rapprochement with Russia it is not surprising that Donald Trump Junior’s interest was piqued.
However this information – whatever it was – would have had to have been made public if it was going to be used, and since it was supposed to take the form of official Russian government documents provided to the Trump campaign by the Russian government that would have meant that the fact that the Russian government was involved and was the source would have had to be disclosed. There was and could have been no intention to keep the fact secret.
That is what Donald Trump Junior obviously anticipated when he agreed to meet Veselnitskaya, and what he must have thought the Russian government intended. The emails cannot be read in any other way.
This is a wholly different scenario from the one suggested in the Russiagate affair. That alleges secret collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government as part of a ‘dirty tricks’ campaign involving an illegal hack of the DNC’s and John Podesta’s computers in order to publish stolen emails which would swing the election from Hillary Clinton to Donald Trump.
This by contrast was or was supposed to be a straightforward and above the board offer of information by the Russian government to the Trump campaign that might be useful in the election.
There is nothing wrong or sinister or illegal in Donald Trump Junior being interested in this. There would have been nothing wrong or illegal in Donald Trump Junior receiving from the Russian government official Russian government documents about Hillary Clinton’s dealings with Russia in this way.
Nor would there have been anything wrong or illegal if Donald Trump Junior or the Trump campaign had made this information public, all the more so as the fact that the Russian government was the source would have had to be disclosed.
Some people of course refuse to see it this way. Take for example these words in the Guardian’s editorial on the story
Mr Trump Jr stressed that the lawyer was not, in fact, a Russian government official. But he met her believing that she was, and having heard that Moscow wished to intervene in a US election. He did not report the approach to the FBI.
Why however should Donald Trump Junior have “reported the approach to the FBI”? Since nothing wrong or illegal was proposed or happened what was there to report?
To repeat, there would have been nothing wrong or illegal about Donald Trump Junior receiving openly from a representative of the Russian government official Russian government documents detailing Hillary Clinton’s dealings with Russia. Not only would that have been neither wrong nor illegal, had it happened it would arguably have been in the public interest.
We now have come to the strangest aspect of this strange affair.
Veselnitskaya was not a representative of the Russian government. The Russian government claims to have no knowledge of her. She was definitely not a “Russian government attorney” (whatever that means). Not only did she turn up to the meeting empty-handed, with no information or official Russian government documents about Hillary Clinton’s dealings with Russia, but by her own account she was surprised that Donald Trump Junior expected her to be in possession of such information
“I never had any damaging or sensitive information about Hillary Clinton. It was never my intention to have that,” Natalia Veselnitskaya said.
When asked how Trump Jr. seemed to have the impression that she had information about the Democratic National Committee, she responded:
“It is quite possible that maybe they were longing for such an information. They wanted it so badly that they could only hear the thought that they wanted.”
This is extremely strange, and is wholly at odds with how Rob Goldstone describes her in his emails.
In those emails Veselnitskaya is clearly described as a “Russian government attorney” representing the Russian government. Moreover she is coming to the US from Moscow on behalf of a senior Russian official – the “Crown Prosecutor of Russia” – who is supposed to have offered information including official Russian government documents detailing Hillary Clinton’s dealings with Russia in a conversation with the father of one of Goldstone’s clients. This supposedly was done as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr Trump“.
Clearly someone was misrepresenting who and what Veselnitskaya actually was.
There is no Russian official with the title “Crown Prosecutor of Russia”. However the fact that Goldstone claims that it was this official – whoever he is – who instigated Veselnitskaya’s mission after making an offer to help the Trump campaign to the father of one of Goldstone’s clients argues against Veselnitskaya being the person who was behind the deception.
Veselnitskaya’s claim that she was baffled that Donald Trump Junior seemed to expect her to have information about Hillary Clinton might therefore be true.
In that case it must have been either the “Crown Prosecutor of Russia” – whoever he is – or the father of Goldstone’s client, or Goldstone’s client, or conceivably Goldstone himself, who was behind the deception.
I am not going to try to guess who was the person behind the deception. The one point I would make is that Goldstone is British and that though Russia has no official with the title “Crown Prosecutor of Russia” the title “crown prosecutor” is used in Britain as the official title of state officials roughly analogous to US District Attorneys.
Possibly someone who knows Goldstone is British and therefore familiar with the title “crown prosecutor” took advantage of the fact to deceive him, though in that case whoever that was must have some knowledge of Britain.
Whatever the truth of this, there is no doubt that a deception took place, and Goldstone’s emails show that the person who was the target of the deception was Donald Trump Junior.
That in turn raises the uncomfortable question of whether what we have here are the traces of a failed sting operation.
I have previously pointed out that the first entry of the Trump Dossier dated 20th June 2016 makes no reference to hacking but instead speaks of the Russians helping Donald Trump by providing his campaign with information from a secret Dossier they hold on Hillary Clinton.
Here we have in Goldstone’s emails proof that in early June 2016 – the same month that the first entry of the Trump Dossier is dated – an offer was indeed made via Donald Trump Junior to the Trump campaign – but importantly not by the Russian government – to provide the Trump campaign with damaging information about Hillary Clinton’s dealings with Russia, presumably from a file or a Dossier the Russians hold on her.
The follow up to these emails was a meeting between Donald Trump Junior and a Russian lawyer – Veselnitskaya – who allegedly has some connection to Fusion GPS, the company which paid for the Trump Dossier.
In the event the sting operation – if that is what it was – fell apart when it turned out during the meeting that Veselnitskaya had no information to offer and did not represent the Russian government, and that rather than press her further for ‘information’ about Hillary Clinton or admit either verbally to Veselnitskaya or in an email that the Trump campaign was already in receipt of such information from the Russians, Donald Trump Junior instead showed her the door.
This is of course speculation, though fact based. As I have said previously, there is no doubt a deception of some sort took place and that Donald Trump Junior was its intended target.
What is not speculation – what is on the contrary incontrovertible fact – is that Donald Trump Junior at no time acted improperly or committed any crime either in the emails he wrote or when he met Veselnitskaya.
That for the moment is the single most important fact about this incident.
There are many unanswered questions about this incident, as indeed there are about the Flynn affair. Perhaps one day we will have the answers to these questions.
The key point about these unanswered questions is however that they do not concern Donald Trump Junior. It is for others not him to answer them.
On the contrary he is the only person of whom it can be said with confidence that he behaved straightforwardly and honestly throughout this whole strange affair.",The Duran,1

"Despite condemning the mission, Trump...","Iraqi special forces advance towards the city of Mosul, Iraq on Oct. 19, 2016.
Photo by Khalid Mohammed/AP
Despite condemning the mission, Trump praises success in Mosul
When ISIS seized control of Mosul two years ago, it sent a chilling signal to much of the world. The fact that Iraqi forces have now effectively driven ISIS out of Iraq’s second largest city is therefore a major development.
Indeed, Donald Trump issued a statement late yesterday, celebrating the developments. It read in part:
“We have made tremendous progress against ISIS – more in the past 6 months than in the years since ISIS became a major threat. The victory in Mosul, a city where ISIS once proclaimed its so-called ‘caliphate,’ signals that its days in Iraq and Syria are numbered. We will continue to seek the total destruction of ISIS.”
What the White House statement neglected to mention is just how opposed Trump was to the mission from the outset.
As regular readers may recall, a few weeks before Election Day in the U.S., Trump told a national audience that the military offensive in Mosul is part of an elaborate, international conspiracy to help Hillary Clinton’s campaign.
A week later, Trump went further, condemning the U.S.-backed offensive in Mosul as “a total disaster” that’s leaving the United States looking “dumb.” Soon after, the Republican kept complaining, insisting the campaign in Mosul should’ve been kept secret. “I’m telling you, folks, our leadership – I went to an Ivy League school, but there’s some words that you can’t describe any better: Our leadership is stupid,” Trump told a Florida audience. “These are stupid people.”
Three days before Election Day, Trump declared, “What a group of losers we have,” in apparent reference to the military and civilian commanders who have helped with the Mosul campaign. The same day, the Republican again whined that the military offensive was somehow intended to undermine his political campaign and help his opponent.
Even at the time, there was bipartisan agreement that Trump’s rhetoric was indefensibly foolish. And yet, now the president is celebrating the mission he opposed, hoping his rhetoric will disappear down the memory hole.

Sagan eyes Tour de France reprieve after disqualification,"Vittel (France) – World champion Peter Sagan faces a race against time to make the start line for Wednesday’s fifth stage of the Tour de France after appealing a decision to expel him.
The 27-year-old Slovak was kicked off the Tour on Tuesday after causing a crash that saw Mark Cavendish taken to hospital with a broken shoulder blade.
Cavendish had to quit the Tour following the crash 100 metres from the finish line of Tuesday’s fourth stage to Vittel.
Sagan appeared to elbow him into the barriers during a muscular sprint, with the race commission later deciding to expel the Bora rider for having “endangered some of his colleagues seriously” at the finish.
Bora reacted late on Tuesday saying they had appealed the decision and asked that Sagan be reinstated. However the appeal is unlikely to sway the commission which unceremoniously dumped him off the Tour the previous day.
“In the sprint I didn’t know that Mark Cavendish was behind me,” said Sagan. “Mark was coming really fast from the back and I just didn’t have time to react and to go left.”

Bernie’s Daughter Paid $1/2 Mil To Teach Woodworking At Jane’s Bankrupt College,"Just when Bernie Sanders thought his college corruption scandal could not get worse, it is discovered that nepotism is involved in the chaos as well!
Carina Driscoll, the daughter of the Bernie and Jane Sanders, was hired to teach woodworking at the bankrupt Burlington College that Jane drove into the dirt.
But there’s more! Burlington College did not have a woodworking class when Jane Sanders arrived at the college in 2004. But Bernie and Jane’s daughter had the Vermont Woodworking School which was was a for-profit business.
You see where we are going here…
Tax records from 2009 show that Burlington College paid Vermont Woodworking School $56,474 for materials, leasing bench space and other various charges. The expenditure was reported as it related to a relationship between Driscoll and the college.
Then Carina Driscoll was hired to teach, at a salary earning $500,000. It helped push the college into bankruptcy. Nepotism at its finest!
From Investment Watch Blog:
Over the next four years, funds to VT Woodworking School increased considerably from this original amount to $133,134 in 2010; $138,571 in 2011; and, $182,741 in 2012 (the last year program expenses are reported in the tax filings).
Jane Sanders very openly funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars to her daughter at the expense of Burlington College.
This on the heels of the discovery that Jane Sanders attempted to evict 16 disabled residents from a group home facility. As president of now-defunct Burlington College, she was trying to negotiate the multi-million-dollar acquisition of 33 acres of prime real estate and a building owned by the local Roman Catholic Diocese.
Judicial Watch obtained a letter from Jane Sanders to an attorney, Todd Centybear, who represented the group home at the time of the ill-fated transaction.
In the letter, Sanders expresses frustration that the disabled residents would not leave the premises.
“It is simply not fair to expect the College to continue to carry the burden of the expenses associated with housing both your population and ours until February 2012,” Jane Sanders wrote, according to Judicial Watch.
A federal investigation is probing allegations that Jane Sanders fraudulently obtained a bank loan for the bankrupt college. Bernie himself is being looked at for using his influence to pressure the bank to approve the loan.
During Mrs. Sanders’s seven-year tenure as president at Burlington, the college sought to expand its campus by purchasing 33 acres of land for $10 million.
The problem was that Burlington College had nowhere near $10 million to spend and its total annual budget was less than $4 million.
Vermont’s Educational and Health Buildings Finance Agency offered Burlington $6.5 million in tax-exempt bonds. People’s United Bank agreed to give Burlington College a $6.5 million loan to purchase the bonds. That bank loan was contingent on Jane’s promise that she had secured $5 million in donations and $2.4 million in confirmed pledges., It seems that Sanders lied and had not secured these funds before accepting the loan.
Bernie has not been handling the questions on this scandal well. I wonder why!
When CNN’s Erin Burnett broached the topic, Sanders grew irritated and snapped at her:
“Excuse me, excuse me,” Sanders shouted. “My wife is about the most honest person I know. When she came to that college, it was failing financially and academically. When she left it, it was in better shape than it had ever been.”
This scandal seems to have legs. It will be interesting to watch as we go forward. Obama is no longer in control of the Justice Department. It is now a different world for Democrats and their corruption!",Ihavethetruth,1
"Walmart purse-snatcher threatens to shoot shoppers who chased him out, police say","July 20, 2017 10:18 AM
 
A police officer who happened to be shopping in a Walmart was able to help stop a 17-year-old purse-snatching suspect who threatened people with a handgun, officials say.
At 5:12 p.m. Wednesday, the Ocean Springs Police Department received a 911 call of an armed robbery inside the Walmart on U.S. 90, saying a man took a purse from a female and ran away.
The woman ran after him, police said in a press release, and other shoppers joined her as they chased him outside. Once outside, the man pulled out a handgun and pointed it at the crowd, threatening to shoot them, according to the press release.
The officer who was inside also followed the man and watched him get into a black Dodge pickup and drive toward the east exit of the parking. The officer was able to call in a description of the vehicle in time for other officers to stop the truck before it left the parking lot.
Nicholas Jvante Brothern, 17, was arrested on an armed robbery charge and he is being held at the Ocean Springs jail pending an initial appearance.
Two other males and a female were inside the truck, and police are questioning them.
Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call police at 228-875-2211.

California man sentenced to 16 years in prison for killing 21 cats
Robert Farmer appears in a San Jose courtroom, December 15, 2015.
SAN JOSE, Calif. -- A Santa Clara County Superior Court judge has sentenced a 26-year-old California man to 16 years in prison for killing 21 cats, some of which he lured from people's homes.
Robert Roy Farmer pleaded guilty last year to 21 felony counts of animal cruelty and one count each of misdemeanor battery and being under the influence.
The cats began mysteriously disappearing from San Jose's Cambrian Park neighborhood in September 2015. Then cats began turning up dead, the Mercury News of San Jose reported Friday.
Farmer was arrested on October 8, 2015, as he slept in his car, CBS San Francisco reported. San Jose police found an unidentified orange tabby dead curled up in the center console, along with chunks of fur, blood, fur-covered gloves and a hunting knife.

Trey Gowdy Comments On Jeh Johnson’s Testimony And Lynch’s Controversy,"Home POLITICS  
 
With former FBI Director James Comey’s hearing on Capitol Hill, Democrats were confident that they would finally have evidence about President Donald Trump colluding with the Russians.
Unfortunately for them, that never happened. What did happen was Comey letting slip that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch had played a big role in the Hillary Clinton email scandal.
Comey said he felt ‘uncomfortable’ when Lynch made him refer to the email investigation as a ‘matter.’
However, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) said that he would love to hear from Lynch, and specifically ask her why she used the word ‘matter.’
After former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson’s hearing, Gowdy went on Fox News to discuss it.
Gowdy said it is “a little ironic” that some Democrats are now complaining about the lack of help they got with the Democratic National Committee’s servers, which were compromised by Russia during the 2016 campaign season.
During the testimony, Johnson said he was not pleased that the DNC did not turn over its compromised servers to the Department of Homeland Security for examination.
Fox News host Martha McCallum asked Gowdy why he thinks Democrats might not want the DNC server examined.
“Let me hazard a wild guess: that there may be something else on that server that they didn’t want law enforcement to see?” Gowdy remarked.
Regarding Loretta Lynch’s ‘request’ the investigation to be referred to as a ‘matter, the South Carolina Congressman added:
“I don’t know what her point was, although I think I do know what her objective was,” Gowdy said, implying it may have been political.
It has been also revealed that the Democratic National Committee didn’t allow the FBI to examine their servers when they were hacked, reports Teddy Stick.
Gowdy speculated that the reason was because they had something to hide.
Then, the host of the program asked Gowdy what he wants to question the former AG about.
“I am always interested when any person we hire to work for that blindfolded woman holding a set of scales, whether it’s a Republican or Democrat, does anything to put his or her finger on the scale.”

But Soros is truly evil. He has funded far left, anti-American groups around the world while profiting off the manipulation of countries’ currencies. McCain’s foundation is funded by America’s enemies:
But the McCain Institute — created in 2012 with an $8.7 million donation of funds remaining from McCain’s unsuccessful 2008 presidential campaign — refused Monday to disclose the amounts it received from its biggest donors who gave $100,000 or more.
Spokesmen for the McCain Institute and for the Arizona State University (ASU) Foundation — where the nonprofit’s finances are held — refused to divulge any dollar amounts from big ticket donors despite repeated requests by TheDCNF.
A McCain Institute executive referred TheDCNF’s donor request to the ASU Foundation. An ASU Foundation spokesman side-stepped the issue of disclosure, replying to TheDCNF by issuing a statement — “in the spirit of transparency, the McCain Institute for International Leadership elects to provide a list of donors on its website.”
However, the McCain Institute declined to spell out exactly how much money each big donor contributed. The web site only lists donors who have given “$100,000 and above,” which can be misleading.
The Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia, for instance, is identified as giving $100,000 or more on the Institute’s website. In reality, the Saudis gave $1 million.
By housing the McCain Institute in the ASU foundation, the donations are unavailable under the state’s open records law.
“This is a way to raise money and to protect donor privacy,” Leslie Lenkowsky, a long-time scholar and authority in philanthropy, told TheDCNF.
Shockingly, of the 37 donors who contributed $100,000 or more to the McCain Institute, one in three originate from either foreign principals, overseas corporations, or foreign governments according to the nonprofit’s web site. One big donor is anonymous.
And McCain doesn’t pretend to keep his distance from the organization. As The Daily Caller noted, “Not only is McCain’s name on the masthead, he is also the honorary convener of the McCain Institute’s signature spring annual meeting, the Sedona Forum. The Sedona Forum is a ‘high level, private gathering’ held at the luxurious Enchantment Resort in Sedona, Ariz.”
Isn’t this the sort of access and criminal activity we saw in 2016 at the Clinton Foundation? Why won’t John McCain disclose his foreign donors?
What do you think about the McCain Institute not listing their donors? Please leave us a comment (below) and tell us.

McCain is a morally challenged criminal nut job who should be in prison! He has already been outed for his many crimes & for being a pedophile. A better place for him than prison would be 6 feet underground!!

McCain is a criminal and should be investigated, charged & sentenced.

Time for this old goat to go! He’s just an obstructionist and an embarrassment to the party. Make him ambassador to Viet Nam or something.

How Trump Misunderstands the US-Korea FTA,"His ‘common sense’ approach to trade deficits is a misreading of basic economics.
With traction gathering for a renegotiation of the free trade agreement between the United States and South Korea, a key driving force, ironically, has been common sense. The argument goes as follows: when a country imports more than it exports (i.e. has a trade deficit), it loses money because it is buying more goods than it is selling. This is a very simple perspective that applies well to the financial health of a company, something President Donald Trump and the various ex-CEOs on his cabinet, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, understand well. The problem is this simplistic view does not really apply to the economy of an entire country, as it ignores several important complexities.
Take, for example, the fact that an investment in a foreign company is actually an export. Let’s say a U.S. company called “Happy Play” wants to build a toy factory in California. To do this, Happy Play must purchase building materials, land, building services, machinery for building toys, and the labor to make toys. To purchase these goods and services, Happy Play has two choices: it can either pay cash or receive investments.
Most companies don’t have large amounts of cash just sitting around so they usually need investments to cover the cost. Happy Play can receive these investments by selling its own stock or other assets it owns (i.e. perhaps Happy Play owns some stock in Coca Cola or a building in New Jersey). If the investor who buys Happy Play stock is Korean, the United States is effectively receiving an import of foreign capital. Since the Happy Play stock the Korean investor buys is still a part of a U.S. company, the stock itself functions as neither an export nor an import (it is an asset). The dividends earned from the stock, however, become money exported from the United States and imported into Korea. Since the Korean investment creates new jobs and consumption in California, it is hard to say this is a bad thing for the U.S. economy.

The opposite of an investment (money coming in) is a saving (money going out). Let’s say Happy Play does really well with its new factory and makes a lot of money. This money will do one of two things: go into a bank or be invested by Happy Play. If Happy Play invests the money in a foreign company, it is now exporting that capital overseas. If the money goes into a bank, the bank will invest the money, sometimes domestically, sometimes abroad. If the investment is made abroad, that again becomes an export with future earnings being imported back. In this way, even savings participate very directly in trade deficits: if a country is not saving as much, it is exporting less capital. With U.S. household savings at very low levels, this becomes one of the key reasons for a low export value.
Another trend that adversely affects import/export balance is the fact that the United States is the preferred “safe haven” for global investments. Just about every bank or investment firm in the world has a preference for investing in U.S. companies, currency, and government bonds, as these are considered to be some of the safest items on the market. This fact alone makes it virtually impossible for the United States to ever have anything but an import (investment) surplus because foreign capital is always flowing in more than domestic capital is flowing out.
One of the consequences of heavy investment in the U.S. dollar is overvaluation. Not only is the dollar the most frequently used currency in international trades but it is also one of the preferred investment currencies for such things as mutual funds. This raises the strength of the dollar compared to other currencies. On the face of it, common sense might suggest this a good thing — when is being “weak” ever good, right? — but, in fact, the strength of the dollar is something that directly hurts U.S. export products. Let’s go back to Happy Play to see why.
Let’s say Happy Play can make toys at a labor rate of $1 per toy. It can sell each toy in South Korea for 1,500 Korean won. If the exchange rate is 1,000 Korean won/dollar, Happy Play makes 500 won per toy. However, if the currency exchange rate changes to improve the strength of the dollar, making it 1,200 won/dollar, then Happy Play makes 200 won less profit per toy. Conversely, Korean exports are helped by a strong dollar. If a Korean toy company makes toys at a labor rate of 1,000 won per toy and sells them for $2 in the United States, the exchange rate change from 1,000 won/dollar to 1200 won/dollar improves the profit margin from 1,000 won to 1,400 won. With South Korea’s currency having steadily devalued in the last year, it is not surprising to see some accuse the government of currency manipulation.
In summary, the common sense view of “treating a country like a company” is surprisingly misguided, ignoring a few critical facts about trade deficits and how import/export numbers are derived. The first is that import/export figures aren’t just about buying and selling physical goods: investments and savings also participate very actively in these numbers. The second is that confidence in the U.S. economy actually works to create trade deficits (with more investment coming in than going out). The third is the fact that a strong dollar is exacerbated by this confidence, working to make U.S. exports less competitive and less profitable. Adding tariffs or taxes on Korean goods imported into the United States may marginally improve the U.S. government’s revenue but it will do little to address the larger underlying issues that perpetuate trade deficits.

Eurosceptic Tory backbenchers bristle after environment secretary says ministers agree on ‘pragmatic’ approach to free movement
Jessica Elgot and Anushka Asthana
Friday 21 July 2017 13.07 EDTFirst published on Friday 21 July 2017 07.48 EDT
Michael Gove has said the cabinet is committed to a post-Brexit transition period that takes a “pragmatic approach” to free movement, as Eurosceptic Tory backbenchers warned the UK must not “check out and never leave”.
The environment secretary said a transition was needed to give businesses and the agriculture industry reassurance and different sectors had impressed upon the government the importance of avoiding a cliff edge exit from the EU, after his first major speech since returning to the cabinet.
Michael Gove 'deeply regrets' Trump's approach to Paris climate agreement
On Thursday, the Guardian reported a senior cabinet source as saying those ministers in favour of a soft Brexit had persuaded colleagues to accept free movement continuing during a transition period post-Brexit for anything up to four years. After the transition period the UK would be out of both the customs union and the single market.
Gove, a leading leave campaigner, was said to have recently been convinced of the need for a transition period upon entering the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. In a speech to environmental groups at the WWF, Gove said he was in favour of the idea.
“I know not just from agriculture but from other industries how important it is that we ensure we continue to have access to the high-quality labour on which our economy depends,” he said.
“As we leave the European Union, we will have an implementation period which will ensure we continue to have not just access to labour but the economic stability and certainty that business requests. That is something around which the government and the cabinet is united.”
Pressed on whether free movement of people should continue during that period, Gove said the system had to be consistent with the referendum result but also practically achievable.
“I think that when it comes to an implementation period, it should be driven by a pragmatic judgment, a shared pragmatic judgment, about what we need in the best interests of our economy and guaranteeing a smooth exit from the European Union, in line with the result that the British people voted for just over a year ago,” he said.
He refused to put a figure on the number of years a transition period could last. “Pragmatism is the watchword,” he said. “The judgment we need to make is what is in the interests of our economy consistent with recognising the instruction the British people gave us last June.”

Conservative backbenchers have bristled at the suggestions that free movement of labour could continue once the UK has formally left the EU in March 2019. Charlie Elphicke, an officer of the influential European Research Group of Tory backbenchers who want the government to get on with Brexit, said the key was that any implementation phase was “transitional”.
“Otherwise people will worry that we will end up in a ‘Hotel California’ situation,” he said. “You can check out but you can never leave.”
Elphicke said his constituents in Dover had raised concerns on Friday after reports about the possibility of free movement continuing for two to four years after Brexit is supposed to take place in the spring of 2019. “Transition means transition,” he added. “People want certainty. Not an ever-disappearing end date. As long as we are checking out, and we actually leave, they will be happy.”
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told BBC Radio 4’s the World at One he did not believe cabinet members truly backed the continuation of free movement post-March 2019.
“Free movement has to end no later than 31 March 2019 and I think most Conservative MPs would say that, the country would say that … and I think Mrs May would say that,” he said.
A senior cabinet source told the Guardian on Thursday that the mood had shifted significantly over the past five weeks and that ministers now hoped to agree a transition period based on an “off-the-shelf” model to give certainty to UK business.
Business groups have repeatedly stressed their desire for a transitional deal, with the CBI suggesting continued membership of the single market and the customs union until new trading arrangements were in place.
The Brexit secretary, David Davis, has publicly softened his approach in recent weeks, telling a House of Lords select committee that practicalities would force a need for a transition period. Advocates of a soft transition include the business secretary, Greg Clark, and the chancellor, Philip Hammond.
Two “off-the-shelf” models that could apply to the UK during the transition period include European Economic Area membership, which includes single-market access and exemption from some EU rules, though members pay budget contributions and accept free movement.
The Swiss model, membership of the European Free Trade Association (Efta), means access to the EU market for some but not all areas of trade, with no duty to apply EU laws apart from some trade regulation, although free movement also applies.
Labour MP Wes Streeting, a supporter of the Open Britain campaign which lobbies for a soft Brexit, said the shift in attitude in cabinet towards transition arrangements was a “big victory for the chancellor”.
He added: “If they are serious about doing what is best for our economy, then they should start exploring British membership of the single market and the customs union beyond a transition period.”",The Guardian – Politics,0
W.H. Officials Trying To Distract Trump From Tweeting In The Funniest Way Ever,"In the last few months, President Trump’s tweets have gone from bad to worse. Instead of just being proof of his general incompetence, Trump’s tweets have recently resulted in him being accused of serious crimes like witness intimidation.
According to The Washington Post, White House officials have been running themselves ragged trying to keep the president away from cable news and off of social media. They’ve even gone so far as to establish a new morning routine for him.
Trump now gets on the phone with members of his legal and public-relations teams most mornings around 6:30 a.m. — before the morning news shows come on. Three senior White House officials told WaPo that the calls are “part strategy consultation and part presidential venting session.”
During the phone calls, Trump reportedly goes over the latest headlines and works with his team to decide how to best combat his various enemies: Robert Mueller, who is leading the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia; the “fake news” media; and even his own Justice Department, which is overseeing the aforementioned investigation.
The purpose of the calls is for Trump to compartmentalize the investigation so that he can get other things done during the day and won’t take out his rage on Twitter. However, officials have said that, so far, the plan hasn’t been working. One top adviser could only laugh when asked if the calls have been effective.
In addition to getting the president on the phone and away from the television, senior White House officials have also been trying to come up with a better communications operation. They’re reportedly considering a communications “brain trust,” which WaPo defined as “a media team equipped to handle incoming and outgoing issues, as well as everything from surrogate response to regional and national media.”
Insiders also said that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway has been asked to play a larger role on the president’s communications team to help mitigate the damage he does on social media.
Republicans on the outside are growing frustrated with the president’s constant tweeting, and some have even suggested that he draws energy from creating chaos.
Peter Wehner, who served as a White House aide under President George W. Bush, referred to Trump’s behavior as a “psychological drama.”
‘What’s playing out is a psychological drama, not just a political drama or a legal drama. The president’s psychology is what’s driving so much of this, and it’s alarming because it shows a lack of self-control, a tremendous tropism … He seems to draw psychic energy from creating chaos and disorder.’
Roger Stone, a longtime ally of Trump’s, has also said that Trump needs to start taking the investigation led by Mueller more seriously.
‘This is a train that’s coming. These guys are going to move on him despite the fact that they don’t have a case. The question on the table is what is he going to do about it, and that is a legal and political question.’
With his frequent outbursts, Trump is quickly driving away a significant portion of his base. No matter what his aides settle on as their final strategy for dealing with the president’s Twitter tantrums, they’re going to have to step up their game, fast.

Omnitrax says it won't pay for rail repairs in Churchill, Manitoba
CHURCHILL, Man. — Omnitrax says the flooded-out rail line to Churchill, Man., could be fixed before this winter, but the company won’t be putting up the money to do it.
Omnitrax officials said Tuesday the price tag for the repairs would be between $20 million and $60 million and the work would take 60 days, starting at the beginning of September and finishing at the end of October — if no major issues arise.
But they said Denver-based Omnitrax has already put more than $75 million into the track — the only route into the community by land — between 1997 and 2015.
“We just can’t make sense out of investing more money into this railway,” said spokesman Peter Touesnard.
The province responded with a terse statement.
“What was made clear (Tuesday) by senior Omnitrax officials is that they are not prepared to repair, maintain or operate the rail line,” said Infrastructure Minister Blaine Pedersen.
“It appears that they intend to abandon the line.”
Churchill Mayor Mike Spence said something has to be done: “This is not acceptable.”
The subarctic community of 900 on the western shore of Hudson Bay has been looking for help since the rail line was severely damaged by flooding in May.
“We’re slowly getting used to being a fly-in, fly-out community,” said resident Joe Stover, adding they’ve been left with a lot of confusion and waiting.
“People are still in that limbo stage where you don’t really know what’s going to go on. You prepare for it, I suppose, but you don’t really think that far ahead, like it’s going to happen until you actually know it’s going to happen.”
On Monday, the province said it will increase its subsidy for milk, infant formula and fresh fruit and vegetables. Right now a four-litre jug of milk is costing $12.
The federal government had previously extended its Nutrition North food subsidy program to Churchill.",National Post,0
"List of demands on Qatar by Saudi Arabia, other Arab nations","June 23, 2017 1:39 AM
 
Acting as a mediator, Kuwait has presented Qatar a long-awaited list of demands from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, four Arab nations that cut ties with Qatar in early June. A copy of the list was obtained by The Associated Press and translated from Arabic.
A look at the demands:
— Curb diplomatic ties with Iran and close its diplomatic missions there. Expel members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard from Qatar and cut off any joint military cooperation with Iran. Only trade and commerce with Iran that complies with U.S. and international sanctions will be permitted.
— Sever all ties to ""terrorist organizations,"" specifically the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamic State group, al-Qaida, and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Formally declare those entities as terrorist groups.
— Shut down Al-Jazeera and its affiliate stations.
— Shut down news outlets that Qatar funds, directly and indirectly, including Arabi21, Rassd, Al Araby Al-Jadeed and Middle East Eye.
— Immediately terminate the Turkish military presence currently in Qatar and end any joint military cooperation with Turkey inside of Qatar.
— Stop all means of funding for individuals, groups or organizations that have been designated as terrorists by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, Bahrain, the United States and other countries.
— Hand over ""terrorist figures"" and wanted individuals from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain to their countries of origin. Freeze their assets, and provide any desired information about their residency, movements and finances.
— End interference in sovereign countries' internal affairs. Stop granting citizenship to wanted nationals from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain. Revoke Qatari citizenship for existing nationals where such citizenship violates those countries' laws.
— Stop all contacts with the political opposition in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain. Hand over all files detailing Qatar's prior contacts with and support for those opposition groups.
— Pay reparations and compensation for loss of life and other, financial losses caused by Qatar's policies in recent years. The sum will be determined in coordination with Qatar.
— Align itself with the other Gulf and Arab countries militarily, politically, socially and economically, as well as on economic matters, in line with an agreement reached with Saudi Arabia in 2014.
— Agree to all the demands within 10 days of it being submitted to Qatar, or the list becomes invalid. The document doesn't specify what the countries will do if Qatar refuses to comply.
— Consent to monthly audits for the first year after agreeing to the demands, then once per quarter during the second year. For the following 10 years, Qatar would be monitored annually for compliance.

The White House’s calamitous week,"President Trump speaks during a joint news conference with Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri this week. (AP)
The Trump White House is in a perpetual state of discord. But even by its standards, this week was remarkable.
Just to recap, the week included:
* Republicans failing — apparently for good — to deliver on a long-standing GOP and Trump promise to repeal Obamacare, thanks to a statement vote from none other than Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), whose war hero status Trump poo-pooed as a candidate.
* Trump announcing a ban on transgender members of the military that was apparently news to both the military and Congress and still isn’t sorted out, with several GOP senators opposing it and the Joint Chiefs of Staff issuing a statement that the military would continue to work with transgender employees.
* Trump delivering a highly political speech to Boy Scouts in West Virginia that had the organization’s leaders distancing themselves from his remarks and making assurances that the Boy Scouts don’t take political sides.
* Trump’s new communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, talking about killing leakers and deriding Trump’s other two top White House advisers, Reince Priebus and Stephen K. Bannon, in graphic and vulgar terms.
* Priebus resigning, becoming the fourth high-ranking White House staffer to exit within a little more than six months, alongside Michael Flynn, Michael Dubke and Sean Spicer.
* The head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), telling Trump that the committee would not take up a replacement for Attorney General Jeff Sessions this year if Sessions is relieved of his duties, after Trump continually undermined Sessions on Twitter and in interviews.
* Rebukes from Grassley’s fellow Republican Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and Ben Sasse (Neb.), who said Trump’s potential firings of Sessions and Russia investigation special counsel Robert S. Mueller would be beyond the pale.
* More rebukes from police organizations — including the International Association of Chief of Police and the police department where Trump spoke in Suffolk County, N.Y., on Friday — for suggesting that police shouldn’t be so nice to suspected criminals being taken into custody.
Trump seems to thrive on drama, and this week was chock-full of it. He even seemed to approve of Scaramucci’s very public effort to bring the White House’s internal dissension into public view. To the extent Trump wants his presidency and his White House to resemble a reality TV show, mission accomplished.
But if this is a strategy, it continues to look like a broken one. A president who promised so much winning that his supporters would become tired of winning is still creating much, much more drama than progress or legislation.
And even if he can't see it, those around him apparently can. Check out this brutal quote from an anonymous White House adviser in The Post's story on Priebus: “I think any observer -- including one that did not speak English and knew nothing about politics and came from another planet and solar system -- could, after observing the situation in the White House, realize the White House is failing. And when the White House is failing, you can't replace the president.”
At some point, those supporters have to wonder what the end game of all of this is, apart from keeping us all entertained and fomenting a narrative that a media who documents this chaos is out to get the president. As this week showed, even those who should be allied with Trump are having trouble defending his methods.",Washington Post – Politics,0
ALERT: Trump Quietly Makes CRUEL Move Against Teen Girls – This Is HEARTLESS,"While the rest of the country talks about health care, the Trump administration just took $214 million out of teen pregnancy prevention programs across the U.S. More than 80 different organizations will soon lose funding due to these deep budget cuts.
These cuts will affect several notable institutions of health around the country, including the Chicago Department of Public Health, the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles and Johns Hopkins University.
The Center for Investigative Reporting obtained copies of the grant letters that are sent to these institutions and others every year. This year, the letters stated that funding would stop on June 30, 2018. The letters offered no explanation for this change.
The Obama administration first put these grants in place with a 2020 expiration date. But now, the Trump administration is cutting funding two years ahead of schedule.
“We are just reeling,” said Jennifer Hettema of the University of New Mexico. “We’re not sure how we’ll adapt.” She is the lead researcher on a project that teaches low-income Hispanics and Native American teens about sexual health—a program that won’t survive without funding.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Health and Human Services department has confirmed that the department made these cuts. However, HHS won’t say why they chose to cut funding for these programs, and also has not released any other information about it.
But some of the organizations who received grants claim that the cuts were proposed by Valerie Huber, the new chief of staff to the assistant secretary for health. Huber believes in abstinence-only education, and opposes teaching sexual health awareness in schools.
Huber is the former president and CEO for the National Abstinence Education Association. In her new position, she has much more power to turn her beliefs into policy.
The United States has shockingly high teen pregnancy numbers. In fact, they’re far greater than most other industrialized nations around the world. Right now, the numbers are historically low, and they’ve been on the decline for the last 30 years.
Multiple studies and data confirm that abstinence-only education can actually lead to higher rates of teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.
“This program does not fit within the current administration’s vision,” Kelly Wilson was told in her grant letter. She’s the lead researcher for a teen pregnancy prevention program at Texas A&M University. The program just lost $3 million in grant funding.
The rest of the world may be distracted talking about secret Russian meetings and other scandals, but never forget for a moment that Donald Trump is still the president.
And he is still using his office to make huge changes all over this country. These funding cuts will severely restrict teen pregnancy prevention programs all over the U.S. or eliminate them altogether in the next year.
How much more damage will Donald Trump have the chance to cause between now and then?

"NO SHAME: Right After Trump Jr. Released His Emails, Robert Mueller Did Something Totally DISGUSTING","Joker 34 mins agoNews, Politics, USA, World33 Views
Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller has announced plans to examine the email exchanges surrounding and the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a lawyer linked to the Kremlin.
Trump Jr. has come under fire in recent days after an alleged meeting with a Russian lawyer was leaked to the public. Trump Jr. tried to clear the air Tuesday morning by publicly releasing his entire email correspondence with the publicist Rob Goldstone, who offered to set up the meeting in June of 2016.
Mueller is currently investigating if Russia interfered in the 2016 election, and if the Trump campaign colluded in that interference. The Special Counsel has been accused of bias and criticized for stacking his investigative team with known Democrat donors and Clinton allies.
The Trump Jr. emails are just the latest non-troversy the Democrats and the media have cooked up to delegitimize President Trump. Fortunately, Trump Jr. has already released his emails on Twitter so we can see for ourselves how innocent he is.
After his son released the emails, President Trump put out a statement saying:
“My son is a high-quality person and I applaud his transparency.”
We agree, President Trump! The new Mueller probe into Trump Jr. seems like just another waste of taxpayer time and money. The only consolation is it will all be that much sweeter when the Trump team is finally proven innocent.

Obama Pulled Russian Strings To Smear Trump – New Evidence Rocks Washington!,"The controversy over alleged misconduct regarding connections between the Trump campaign and Russian interests has only gotten more convoluted.
Now, there are so many unsubstantiated statements and so many potential characters, it’ll soon reach critical mass and NOBODY will be able to comprehend it.
To put it another way, the case that has consisted of unproven allegations and the purported involvement of numerous actors, both American and Russian, is likely to have contained irregularities committed by various persons.
But there’s still zero evidence that President Trump, his son, or his campaign staff were the ones who did anything wrong.
The latest twist in this convoluted mess involves the highly questionable approval by the Obama Department of Justice of a request to allow a Russian lawyer into the US before she met with members of the Trump campaign.
It begs the question: Why would Obama’s DOJ do this?
Well, the answer might be that Leftists had been planning this Trump/Russia farce for a very long time.
“The Russian lawyer who penetrated Donald Trump’s inner circle was initially cleared into the United States by the Justice Department under ‘extraordinary circumstances’ before she embarked on a lobbying campaign last year that ensnared the president’s eldest son, members of Congress, journalists and State Department officials, according to court and Justice Department documents and interviews.
This revelation means it was the Obama Justice Department that enabled the newest and most intriguing figure in the Russia-Trump investigation to enter the country without a visa.
Later, a series of events between an intermediary for the attorney and the Trump campaign ultimately led to the controversy surrounding Donald Trump Jr.”
We should never suspect that these “extraordinary circumstances” might be part of a political set-up designed to entrap Trump officials, should we?
But it turns out that this Russian attorney was involved in lobbying activities:
“She also engaged in a pro-Russia lobbying campaign and attended an event at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., where Russian supporters showed a movie that challenged the underpinnings of the U.S. human rights law known as the Magnitsky Act, which Russian President Vladimir Putin has reviled and tried to reverse.

"""Best gig in the town"": L.A. subway construction workers unearth prehistoric fossils","CBS NewsJuly 24, 2017, 9:11 AM
Subway construction project unearths prehistoric fossils in Los Angeles
A subway construction project in Los Angeles is unearthing the prehistoric side of Southern California.
Workers excavating the tunnels discovered fossils of ancient mammals that roamed the area about 11,000 years ago. The historic trove includes bones from extinct beasts, like mammoths and mastodons.
CBS News correspondent Carter Evans went underneath Los Angeles to see how building the city's future is shedding new light on the past.
Underneath one of the busiest parts of the city, one of the largest subway projects in the country is underway. It was here that workers digging the new line literally made a mammoth discovery.
Paleontologist Dr. Ashley Leger oversees a team who works alongside construction crews that are searching for fossils. Their discoveries began with bones of Colombian mammoths who roamed the area in herds during the Ice Age.
A three-foot section of tusk that's at least 11,000 years old, and a nearly complete skull were found at the site.
""It's a dream come true for a paleontologist,"" Leger said. ""This is the bucket list you always want to find at some point in your career. And then it's one of the first things we found here.""
""This is probably the best gig in the town for a paleontologist,"" said Dave Sotero, who works for Los Angeles' Metro, which hired the experts who dig up the past. ""It's not every day you have a subway project going through a rich fossil area. So it's tremendously exciting for everybody on the project.""
Over the next few weeks, the tunnel will close in on an ancient area known as the La Brea Tar Pits, which is located about a mile away. Leger expects the fossil finds will increase dramatically in that area.
Just a couple inches of tar became a sticky death trap for the massive mammals that roamed the area tens of thousand of years ago.
""I think of what's under all of that,"" Leger said. ""Under everyone's feet is this rich history that everybody misses. So we get to open up people's eyes, open up people's imagination and bring the past to life.""
Prehistoric black ooze still seeps from the ground around the museum, which contains the world's largest collection of Ice Age fossils.
""Here at the museum, all of these things come to life,"" Leger said. ""They stand up in front of you. They kind of speak to, you know, that curiosity that we're all born with.""
Almost every bone ever found near the Tar Pits is kept at the museum. They're cataloged for further research, which helps Leger identify one of her newest finds.
Back in the tunnel, more clues about the ancient past keep turning up -- a leg bone from an extinct camel and a tooth from a mastodon.
""We've got mammoths and mastodons on one end,"" Leger said. ""We're finding horses over here. It's been really fun.""
Leger says the best is yet to come. In the next few weeks, she hopes to add more predators like the saber-toothed cat to her finds.

Liberal moviemaker Rob Reiner: ‘Fight to save Democracy’ from Trump ‘now an all out war’,"Dave Urbanski 4 hours
Liberal filmmaker Rob Reiner tweeted Sunday, ""When Fox says that DT colluding with the enemy is not a crime, the fight to save Democracy is now an all out war."" (Image source: YouTube screenshot)
Like the character he played in “All in the Family” way back when, moviemaker Rob Reiner has long been known for his liberal leanings. And he is no fan of Republican President Donald Trump.
Less than two weeks after Republican U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) was seriously wounded by a left-wing gunman during a GOP baseball practice, Reiner went on the attack Sunday with militaristic fervor:
When Fox says that DT colluding with the enemy is not a crime, the fight to save Democracy is now an all out war. US-Stay strong. #Treason
— Rob Reiner (@robreiner) June 25, 2017
“When Fox says that DT colluding with the enemy is not a crime, the fight to save Democracy is now an all out war,” Reiner tweeted. “US-Stay strong.” He added a “treason” hashtag.
It wasn’t the first time Reiner used such rhetoric in reaction to Trump.
Just after the election, Reiner called Trump a “moron” and said the United States was now “fighting the last big major battle since the Civil War.”
Reiner later claimed that Russian involvement in the election was “the greatest attack on this democracy since 1941” — meaning Japan’s surprise bombing of Pearl Harbor.
He also told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” months prior to the election that Trump’s campaign success was partly due to “a lot of people who are racists” — which prompted co-host Joe Scarborough to reply, “Oh, my God. Did you just say that?”
Incidentally, reactions to Reiner’s “all out war” Tweet weren’t terribly kind to the famed director:

U.S. flexes military muscle after North Korea’s ICBM test
Jim Michaels and John Riley, USA TODAY Published 9:01 a.m. ET July 30, 2017 | Updated 4:06 p.m. ET July 30, 2017
The United States successfully conducted a missile defense test using a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system in Alaska. Veuer's Maria Mercedes Galuppo (@mariamgaluppo) has more.

The United States confronted North Korea on Sunday over its latest missile test amid signs that time is running out to halt the rogue nation's headlong rush to build a nuclear weapon capable of reaching American cities.
The U.S. flew two B-1 bombers over South Korea in a show of force after North Korea again tested an intercontinental ballistic missile on Friday.
North Korea's latest missile test signaled that parts of the U.S. mainland, including Los Angeles and Chicago, may be in range of Pyongyang’s weapons.
Vice President Pence said Sunday that the U.S. and its allies plan to increase pressure on North Korea to end its nuclear program.
""The era of strategic patience is over,"" Pence said while in Estonia. ""The president of the United States is leading a coalition of nations to bring pressure to bear until that time that North Korea will permanently abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile program.”
The missile flew 2,300 miles into space and flew for about 45 minutes. If the missile was on a flatter trajectory, it could reach U.S. cities, according to David Wright, an analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, and other experts.
Friday's missile test was North Korea's second test this month of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The launches are part of the North's intensified efforts to build a nuclear missile capable of reaching the United States.
""This was the year they decided to go all out,"" said David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un saw an opportunity to push ahead with the nuclear program as new governments in both South Korea and the United States settled in, he said.
“North Korea remains the most urgent threat to regional stability,” Gen. Terrence O’Shaughnessy, Pacific Air Forces commander, said in a statement announcing Sunday's flyover of bombers.
Even before the latest missile test, U.S. officials expressed heightened concerns about North Korea's intensified nuclear weapons program. Gen. Mark Milley, the Army's chief of staff, said there was still time to use diplomacy to find a solution to the crisis, but ""time is running out.""
""North Korea is extremely dangerous, and it gets more dangerous as time goes by,” he said in a speech Thursday at the National Press Club.
Kim Jong Dae, a member of South Korea's National Assembly and a defense expert, said North Korea is making rapid progress on its nuclear program but isn't yet able to miniaturize a warhead to fit on an ICBM and hasn't perfected the technology so a warhead can re-enter the atmosphere without burning up.
""The reliability (of North Korea's missiles) has increased remarkably,” he said.
Estimates vary on when North Korea will be able to reach U.S. cities with a nuclear warhead. A new estimate from the Defense Intelligence Agency said the country could place a nuclear warhead on an ICBM by next year, The Washington Post reported.
Kim Jong Dae estimated it will be ""within three years.""
The options for stopping North Korea's nuclear ambitions are limited. President Trump has expressed frustration about China's reluctance to place pressure on North Korea to halt its nuclear program. North Korea's economy depends heavily on China.
""I am very disappointed in China,"" Trump said in a pair of tweets Saturday. ""Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk, We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem
U.S. military action risks triggering a devastating war with countless casualties. North Korea has an array of missiles and conventional artillery pointing at Seoul, only about 35 miles from the Demilitarized Zone.
“A war on the Korean Peninsula would be terrible,"" Milley said. ""However, a nuclear weapon detonating in Los Angeles would be terrible.""
""We are at a point in time where choices are going to have to be made one way or the other,"" he said.
Friday's test touched off a variety of responses, in addition to the flyover of U.S. bombers.
South Korea said it will hold talks with the United States about increasing the limits on the size of warheads on its own missiles. A current treaty between South Korea and the United States limits the size of the warheads that South Korea can place on missiles.
The U.S. Missile Defense Agency said it conducted a test of its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) in Alaska by launching a ballistic missile over the Pacific Ocean.
The test missile was fired by a U.S. Air Force C-17 plane and was successfully intercepted, the agency said.

It has become a major Pyongyang landmark but has never been used as a hotel, as it was intended.

Does the SCOTUS’ Ruling in Trinity Lutheran “Profoundly Change” the Relationship Between Church and State?,"As we reported earlier, the Supreme Court issued a much-anticipated ruling today dealing with the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. In the case of Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, the Court held that the policy of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, which prohibited participation in the State’s Scrap Tire Program by churches, sects, or religious entities, violated the rights of the Church under the Free Exercise Clause. Denying the Church an otherwise available public benefit due to its religious status amounted to putting Trinity Lutheran to the following choice: “It may participate in an otherwise available benefit program or remain a religious institution.”
The program in question offers qualifying nonprofit organizations grants for installing playground surfaces made from recycled tires. Pursuant to Article I, Section 7 of Missouri’s Constitution (commonly referred to as the state’s “Blaine Amendment”), the DNR “had a strict and express policy of denying grants to any applicant owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious entity.” Thus, although the Church qualified for the program — and was, in fact, ranked fifth out of the 44 applicants for the year in question — its application was denied by the DNR. The Church filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, which ruled in favor of the State, as did the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Shortly before the Supreme Court heard oral argument in the case, Missouri’s Governor, Eric Greitens, announced that he was directing the DNR to cease its previous policy and to begin allowing religious organizations to compete for the DNR grants. Nevertheless, the Court proceeded to hear and rule on the case, finding that this policy change did not render the matter moot, as it could just as easily be reversed. The Court addressed this in Footnote 1, but it is Footnote 3 which appears to be a sticking point for several of the justices. While the decision was 7 to 2, Justices Thomas and Gorsuch took issue with the Court’s caveat that:
‘This case involves express discrimination based on religious identity with respect to playground resurfacing. We do not address religious uses of funding or other forms of discrimination.”
Both Thomas and Gorsuch found this a bit too narrow. Thomas, in his concurrence, took issue with the Court’s reliance on a 2004 Free Exercise case, Locke v. Davey, as he joined Scalia in dissent on that one. In his concurrence, Gorsuch first explained his concern regarding relying on a distinction between religious status and religious use to distinguish the holding in Locke, as a line which might too readily be blurred. He then points out that, while Footnote 3:
“Is entirely correct…I worry that some might mistakenly read it to suggest that only ‘playground resurfacing’ cases, or only those with some association with children’s safety or health, or perhaps some other social good we find sufficiently worthy, are governed by the legal rules recounted in and faithfully applied by the Court’s opinion. Such a reading would be unreasonable for our cases are ‘governed by general principles, rather than ad hoc improvisations….’ And the general principles here do not permit discrimination against religious exercise — whether on the playground or anywhere else.” (Citation ommitted.)
Justice Breyer also filed a concurring opinion, in which he noted “no significant difference” between this program aimed at improving the health and safety of children and other general government services, such as police and fire protection. He points out that cutting off religious schools or other entities like Trinity Lutheran from such services clearly is not the purpose of the First Amendment.
Huckabee Breaks With Trump, Warns That Senate Healthcare Bill Could Be ""Major Blunder""
In setting forth the Court’s rationale for the decision, Chief Justice Roberts has some encouraging observations for those who prize the First Amendment and, in particular, religious liberty:
“The express discrimination against religious exercise here is not the denial of a grant, but rather the refusal to allow the Church—solely because it is a church—to compete with secular organizations for a grant….Trinity Lutheran is a member of the community too, and the State’s decision to exclude it for purposes of this public program must withstand the strictest scrutiny. (Citation ommitted.)
“The Missouri Department of Natural Resources has not subjected anyone to chains or torture on account of religion. And the result of the State’s policy is nothing so dramatic as the denial of political office. The consequence is, in all likelihood, a few extra scraped knees. But the exclusion of Trinity Lutheran from a public benefit for which it is otherwise qualified, solely because it is a church, is odious to our Constitution all the same, and cannot stand.”
Then we get to the dissent, penned by Justice Sotomayor (and joined by Justice Ginsburg.) In her dissent, Sotomayor opined that:
“The Court today profoundly changes [the relationship between church and state] by holding, for the first time, that the Constitution requires the government to provide public funds directly to a church.”
I haven’t yet had the opportunity to read the entire dissent, but I question Sotomayor’s characterization of the decision. Disallowing the exclusion of a religious organization from a public benefit solely because it is a church profoundly changes the church-state dynamic?!
Shortly after it was handed down, I had the opportunity to speak with Carrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network, and inquired as to her take on Sotomayor’s contention. She called it “nonsense,” and pointed out that Sotomayor’s own opinion makes it clear that historically, there have been far greater instances of involvement between church and state which have been upheld.
Ms. Severino expressed little surprise at the ruling, as it was consistent with the justices’ questioning during oral argument. A big takeaway from this ruling, she believes, is that it, combined with the ruling last week in Matal v. Tam, are encouraging signs that this Court is still very committed to the First Amendment and holding firm on the notion that the government should not be in the business of picking and choosing between religious groups or viewpoints. To that, I say, “Amen!”

"Guess Who’s Less Popular: America’s Immigrant First Lady, or America’s Anti-Immigrant President?","July 8, 2017Kristina Oakes News
A new Fox News poll shows that First Lady Melania Trump is more popular than her husband, President Donald Trump. According to the poll, her approval ratings have gone up by 14 points. That means that her approval rating is at 51 percent.
Why the sudden boost? Well, for one thing, Melania did recently move into the White House after receiving criticism for staying in New York City. Her move possibly brought the change in opinion. This move also gives the American people a chance to finally get to know the First Lady.
When it comes to the poll, the numbers break down how many from both sides of the political spectrum approve of her. It’s not surprising that Republicans view the First Lady more favorably. 82 percent of Republican voters approve of her. 26 percent of Democratic voters approve of her. In addition, 43 percent of Independent voters approve of her.
The article also explained how Melania’s approval ratings have gone up since late last year. A poll was taken of her approval ratings before her husband was elected. According to this recent poll, Trump has an approval rating of 47 percent. No matter what source, Melania is still more popular than her husband.
Some wonder, why is this the case? Does the First Lady always have better approval ratings than the husband? Yes, and there is a reason behind that.
The American people tend to sympathize with the wife because of what the job of the president entails. There’s the traveling, the briefings, and not to mention the First Lady has things to do as well. Their accomplishments receive praise, too. If you look at the history of approval ratings of past Presidents and their First Lady’s, you will find that the First Lady generally has the better approval rating.
No matter how popular or unpopular her husband is, the American people will always find a way to show more love for the First Lady. History is replete with examples of this.
Even as the right wing noise machine did everything it could to demean Hillary Clnton during her time as First Lady, her approval ratings were strong. Naturally, as our first African American First Lady, Michelle Obama was the subject of a lot of racist hatred, and yet, when they went low, her approval ratings went high. Betty Ford drew the ire of some conservatives, despite being first lady to Republican President Gerald Ford, for her somewhat liberal stance on issues like the Equal Rights Amendment. But her approval ratings remained high.
Our current First Lady, Melania Trump, provides perhaps the strongest evidence yet that, no matter what, America loves it’s First Ladies. Even when she’s the immigrant wife of an anti-immigration President. Even when she was born and raised in a former Soviet country, as it comes to light that Russia seems to have interfered in our elections to benefit her husband. Even when she’s a former nude model and the third wife of a “family values” President, who is the darling of the Evangelical right. Even when she’s closer in age to her husband’s daughter than she is to her husband. Even when that husband has publicly expressed his lust for that same daughter so often, and so publicly, that some consider her to be the de-facto first lady. Even when her husband is among the most deeply unpopular Presidents in History. America,
Yes, it seems that Melania Trump’s positive approval ratings provide the best evidence yet that America just simply loves it’s First Ladies. No matter what.

LONDON — British police on Friday confirmed the horrific blaze at Grenfell Tower that killed 79 people was started by a refrigerator fire, and said exterior cladding attached to the public housing project failed fire safety tests carried out by investigators.
Police are now considering manslaughter charges related to the June 14 inferno at the 24-story apartment tower in west London.
A tenants' group complained for years that the building was a firetrap but they have said those concerns fell on deaf ears. Investigators believe the building's exterior cladding allowed the deadliest fire in mainland Britain since the start of the 20th century to spread quickly.
“We are looking at every criminal offense from manslaughter onwards,” Detective Superintendent Fiona McCormack said in a statement. “We are looking at all health and safety and fire safety offenses, and we are reviewing every company at the moment involved in the building and refurbishment of Grenfell Tower.”
Police are considering filing manslaughter charges related to the fire at a west London apartment tower that killed at least 79 people. (June 23)
The government ordered an examination of the refrigerator model — Hotpoint FF175BP — that started the fire. McCormack said the refrigerator freezer had not been subject to any product recalls before the fire.
Hotpoint said Friday that “words cannot express our sorrow at this terrible tragedy,” adding that it was working with authorities to examine to appliance.
The British media have been reporting that the faulty refrigerator belonged to a taxi driver originally from Ethiopia who tried to alert neighbors there was a fire in his kitchen.
Police are looking at all aspects of the cladding system and its installation.
“Preliminary tests show the insulation samples collected from Grenfell Tower combusted soon after the test started,” McCormack said. “The initial tests on equivalent aluminum composite tiles failed the safety tests.”
The new exterior cladding used in a renovation on London's Grenfell Tower may have been banned under UK building regulations. Nearly a dozen other buildings in London are believed to also contain the combustible material.
In total, 11 buildings across the United Kingdom have now been identified as having combustible cladding similar to that used on the Grenfell Tower. Authorities are still examining dozens more buildings in London, Manchester and other large cities.
McCormack also asked for more people who were living in the building to come forward to speak with police. ""What we haven’t got is a picture of how many people might have been in there. That’s the number I’m really worried about.""
About 600 people were thought to be officially living in the building at the time of the fire, but investigators are concerned that a number of people may have been staying there illegally, including recent immigrants and refugees.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan has called for an amnesty for people who may have been living in the tower illegally. Some have been reluctant to come forward over fears they could be deported, although McCormack said the ""priority is to understand who was in Grenfell Tower. We are not interested in people's reasons for being in Grenfell Tower.""

Trump Jabs Pelosi Amid Democratic Infighting,"President Donald Trump mocked divided Democrats Thursday, roiling the waters amid calls from some Democratic lawmakers for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to step down.
I certainly hope the Democrats do not force Nancy P out. That would be very bad for the Republican Party – and please let Cryin' Chuck stay!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 22, 2017
“I certainly hope the Democrats do not force Nancy P out. That would be very bad for the Republican Party – and please let Cryin’ Chuck stay!” Trump tweeted, referencing Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.
Pelosi said Thursday that other Republicans gave Trump the line he wrote about her.
“He then added the Chuck Schumer bit,” she said
Trump’s Thursday tweet followed others earlier in the week poking at the Democrats for failing to work with Republicans on policy and for losing recent special elections.
Democrats would do much better as a party if they got together with Republicans on Healthcare,Tax Cuts,Security. Obstruction doesn't work!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 21, 2017
Well, the Special Elections are over and those that want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN are 5 and O! All the Fake News, all the money spent = 0
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 21, 2017
The defeat of Jon Ossoff in a Tuesday in Georgia unleashed a wave of disaffection among Democrats, with many calling for Pelosi to step down and claiming she has become a drag on the party.
“We need leadership change,” Rep. Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., told CNN. “It’s time for Nancy Pelosi to go, and the entire leadership team.”
Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, said Pelosi is “less popular than Donald Trump in my district.”
Pelosi, who last year easily turned back a challenge from Ryan to hold on to her leadership position, has said she has no plans to step aside.
That’s just fine with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich
“I mean, we have all the ads done. They worked perfectly in Georgia,” he said. “We know exactly how to run against a Nancy Pelosi-led party.”
Gingrich said having Pelosi will help Republicans in the 2018 mid-term elections.
“We’d love to have the question be in 2018, Nancy Pelosi versus Paul Ryan,” Gingrich added. “And I hope that the Democrats keep her right where she is for a long, long time. At least a decade.”",WesternJournalism,1

AAP Image via APSam Mooy
 
July 30, 2017 8:55 PM
Security remained heightened in airports around Australia on Monday with more intense screening of luggage after law enforcement officials said they had thwarted a plan to bring down an airliner.
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Border Protection Minister Peter Dutton declined to comment on newspaper reports that Islamist extremists planned to kill the occupants of a plane with poison gas and that a homemade bomb was to be disguised as a kitchen mincer.
""Police will allege they had the intent and were developing the capability,"" Turnbull told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
Turnbull announced on Sunday that ""a terrorist plot to bring down an airplane"" had been disrupted, but revealed few details.
Four men arrested in raids in Sydney late Saturday — two Lebanese-Australian fathers and their sons — had yet to be charged by Monday.
The government will not comment on media reports that the suspects were not previously known to Australian security officials and that their arrests followed a tip from a foreign intelligence agency.
""Australians can be assured that we have very fine intelligence services and we moved extremely quickly on this one and, as you can see, with the right outcomes,"" Turnbull said.
The Australian newspaper cited multiple anonymous sources saying that the plotters were constructing a ""non-traditional"" explosive device that could have emitted a toxic, sulfur-based gas to kill or immobilize everyone on the aircraft.
Sydney's The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that the plotters planned to make a bomb from wood shavings and explosive material inside a piece of kitchen equipment such as a mincing machine.
Police raided five homes Saturday and removed a domestic grinder and a mincer used to make sausage, the newspaper said.
The plot involved smuggling the device on a flight from Sydney to the Middle East, possibly Dubai, as carry-on luggage, the newspaper said.
Fairfax Media reported the bomb was found in a home in inner-city suburb of Surry Hills, a few doors from the local mosque.
Turnbull declined to say whether the group was guided by someone overseas.
""It'll be alleged that that this was an Islamist extremist, terrorist motivation,"" Turnbull said.
Dutton urged travelers to arrive at Australian airports two hours before domestic flights and three hours before international flights to allow time for more screening. Luggage should be kept to a minimum and those accompanying travelers should not enter secured parts of terminals.
He declined to detail the threat that the security staff were searching for.
""There'll be lots of speculation around what the intent was ... but I don't want to add to that,"" Dutton told Nine Network television.
""Our focus now really is making sure that people who are planning a terrorist attack are thwarted,"" he added.
Security has been increased at Sydney Airport since Thursday because of the plot and has since been increased in all major Australian international and domestic terminals.
Turnbull would not speculate on how long airport security would remain elevated.
""They will be required for as long as the threat is assessed as requiring them,"" Turnbull said.
Australia's terrorist threat level remained unchanged at ""probable.""
Australia is a staunch ally of the United States and partner in military campaigns in the Middle East. The Islamic State group has highlighted Australia as a western target.
The plot was the 13th disrupted by police since Australia's terrorist threat level was elevated in 2014. Five plots have been executed.

“No action is not an alternative,” McConnell said. “We’ve got the insurance markets imploding all over the country, including in this state.”
Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., jumped on the Republican leader's comments, saying McConnell ""opened the door to bipartisan solutions.""
“It’s encouraging that Sen. McConnell today acknowledged that the issues with the exchanges are fixable,"" Schumer said. ""Democrats are eager to work with Republicans to stabilize the markets and improve the law.""
McConnell has raised the idea of working with Democrats previously, but more as a warning than a possibility.
Last week at the White House McConnell said senators have two options for dealing with health care.
""Either Republicans will agree and change the status quo, or the markets will continue to collapse and we'll have to sit down with Senator Schumer,"" McConnell said. “My suspicion is that any negotiation with the Democrats would include none of the reforms that we would like to make.""
McConnell’s comments Thursday came as Republicans struggle to coalesce around a plan.
Because the GOP has such a slim majority in the Senate they can only lose two votes and still pass the bill without Democratic support. Right now, more than a half dozen Republicans have said they won’t vote for the draft legislation and others have expressed concerns. A vote planned for before the July Fourth recess was postponed after it became clear there was not enough Republican support for it to pass.

"Marco Rubio Got Booted From His Own Office For Something Embarrassing, You’ll Crack Up","Former presidential candidate Marco Rubio, a foreign policy wonk, has asserted how he would get tough with America’s adversaries. However, Rubio has clearly shown that he is too cowardly to even face his own constituents.
Rubio, who was recently reelected to his U.S. Senate seat representing Florida, has maintained an office in Tampa as a base for local state operations. However, his landlord just gave Rubio and his team an eviction notice for an embarrassing reason.
According to the Washington Post, Rubio was evicted from his own headquarters as a result of dodging the people he is supposed to represent. Stated the article, “Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and his staff have been booted out of his office in Tampa because of continued weekly protests outside the building. The owner of the Bridgeport Center, which has been renting the space to Rubio since 2014, has decided to not renew the lease because rallies have cost the company money and have become too disruptive for other tenants, Jude Williams, president of America’s Capital Partners, told the Tampa Bay Times. The office needs to be emptied by Thursday, and it appears the senator has yet to find new headquarters in Tampa.”
Gutless Rubio has gone so far as to claim that he is in Europe so that people won’t bother him. He also whined to CBS about how his constituents are unfair to him, saying, “They are not town halls anymore. What these groups really want is for me to schedule a public forum; they then organize three-, four-, five-, six-hundred liberal activists in the two counties or wherever I am in the state. They spread themselves out. They ask questions. They all cheer when questions are asked. They are instructed to boo no matter what answer I give. They are instructed to interrupt me if I go too long and start chanting things. Then, at the end, they are also told not to give up their microphone when they ask questions.” This is, of course, the same person who chided his “establishment” colleagues about Obamacare town halls in 2009. Do you think Marco Rubio needs to grow a pair and face his own voters?

The man behind the Russia election narrative meets with House Intel Panel behind closed doors,"Alex Christoforou4 hours agoJune 28, 2017 99
Clinton former campaign chair John Podesta lost his mobile phone, fell for a phishing scam, and then went on to blame ""Russian Hackers"" for all of HRC's problems.
  has chronicled in many past posts how Hillary Clinton’s failed campaign manager John Podesta was personally responsible for having his entire email data compromised by hackers, in what was later re-packaged by the Clinton campaign staff as “Russian election meddling.”
See here…EXPOSED: John Podesta leaked the Podesta emails to Wikileaks,
here…Hillary hypocrisy: her campaign chairman John Podesta received $35 million from Russian government,
and here…Hillary Clinton’s connection to Russian banks exposed through Tony Podesta’s lobbying contracts.
John Podesta, one of the most powerful men in Washington, had set up an email password choice that left his entire account easily open to hackers.
An example of Podesta’s exemplary password use… According to a recent Bloomberg report, the House Intelligence Committee met behind closed doors Tuesday with John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign chairman, amid complaints by President Donald Trump that the Obama administration didn’t do enough to counter Russian interference in the U.S. election.
Podesta’s email account was hacked, as was the Democratic National Committee’s. Many of those emails were then leaked, producing a steady, negative and sometimes embarrassing stream of news about Clinton’s campaign. But the Democrats didn’t cooperate fully with U.S. investigators.
“The president and the entire administration were dealing with an unprecedented incidence of the weaponization” of Russian cyberactivity, Podesta told reporters after emerging from the hearing room. He said they were dealing with the attacks as best as they could “on behalf of the American people.”
Asked if he’d be coming back before the House or Senate intelligence committees, Podesta said, “Hope not.” He wouldn’t answer when asked if the committee pressed him about the Obama administration’s response to the hacking.
But even Democrats said beforehand that they had some tough questions planned for him.
“I think it’s fair to ask him: What was the campaign’s and administration’s response” to the hacking, said Representative Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat on the Intelligence panel, which is looking into Russian interference in the election.
Representative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the panel, has gone further: He has said said the Obama administration should have done more to counter Russian interference, and done so earlier.
Panel members declined to comment after meeting with Podesta.
Trump on Saturday tweeted in response to a Washington Post story Friday that detailed the Obama administration’s slow deliberations over whether and how to disclose its finding last year that Russia was trying to sway the election.
“Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling, why no action? Focus on them, not T!” the president tweeted.
In a hearing last week, former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told the House Intelligence Committee that it wasn’t until Oct. 7 that he co-authored an administration statement regarding the Russian intrusions.
Schiff complained that was two months after he and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California had written to Obama urging public release of findings related to the DNC hack — and a month after the lawmakers had released their own statement attributing the hack to Russia and senior levels at the Kremlin.
“We were were concerned by making a statement might be, in and of itself, might be challenging the integrity of the election process,” Johnson said.
Committee Republican Trey Gowdy of South Carolina asked Johnson about the DNC’s decision not to turn over its email server to law enforcement or intelligence agencies, saying, “Maybe we would have known more and maybe there would have been more for you to report.”
Schiff followed up: “You’re not somehow saying that justifies the Russian hacking?” he asked Johnson.
Added Schiff, “There is a tendency to blame the victim. The DNC was a victim, was it not?”",The Duran,1
"BREAKING: GOP Senator Stabs Trump In The Back, Declares He Is Challenging Him In 2020 Election","Alice Ali 5 mins agoNews13 Views
President Donald Trump has been facing an attack from Democratic politicians, the liberal media, and even establishment Republicans who are not comfortable with an outsider as President. In fact, politicians in the “Never Trump” camp have already started trying to undermine his leadership by talking about giving him a primary challenge in 2020.
One of the most prominent politicians among the “Never Trump” crowd in Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who recently stated that he sides with liberals over President Trump when it comes to Trump ‘hitting back’ at the press for their relentless attacks against him.
“We differ about really big and important things in this country and then we come together around the First Amendment,” he said about liberals in a recent interview, adding that Trump is “weaponizing distrust.”
“There is an important distinction to draw between bad stories or crappy coverage and the right that citizens have to argue about that and complain — and trying to weaponize distrust,” he commented.
Sasse will soon be traveling to Iowa, the traditional first stop in potential candidates’ campaigns since it holds the nation’s first caucus.
“Well, first of all, let’s be clear why I’m going to be in Iowa this weekend. I don’t want to admit it anywhere, let alone on national TV, but Nebraska lost to Iowa last year in a football game and I lost a bet,” Sassee said in an interview.
“So I have to drive Uber in Iowa next weekend. So that’s the reason I’m going to be in Iowa,” he continued. “It’s about Hawkeyes and Huskers bloodletting on the football field and the aftermath of that.”
What do you think of Sasse’s comments?

"Two Israeli police officers killed by Palestinian gunmen near Jerusalem holy site, police say","Jerusalem's holiest site closed for prayers after shooting
21 July 2017 • 9:55pm
Palestinian gunmen ambushed and killed two Israeli police officers at the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem on Friday, bringing bloodshed and chaos to a religious site that is sacred to both Jews and Muslims.
According to Israeli police, the three attackers smuggled weapons into the mosque complex - which is known to Jews as the Temple Mount - and then burst out and opened fire on the officers early on Friday morning.
All three of the attackers were killed in the shoot out. One of them was gunned down on a plaza in front of the Dome of the Rock, one of Jerusalem’s best known sites.

The shooting led to the cancellation of Friday prayers at the mosque for the first time in decades. Israeli authorities said the mosque, which is the third holiest site in Islam, would remain shut until at least Sunday.
The attackers were all Israeli citizens of Palestinian descent and came from an Arab village in northern Israel, according to the Shin Bet, Israel’s equivalent of MI5. Two of them were 19 and the third was 29 and all they appear to all be relatives.
One of Jerusalem attackers posted a selfie at al-Aqsa right before the shooting. He wrote: ""Tomorrow's smile will be more beautiful"" pic.twitter.com/Bfs2iLh0li

No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but at least one of the gunmen appears to have been motivated by the belief that Israel was trying take control of the mosque.
Mohamammed Hamed Jabreen posted a selfie of himself in front of the Dome of the Rock shortly before the attack, with the message: “Tomorrow's smile will be more beautiful, God willing.”
Under an agreement struck after the 1967 war, Jews are only allowed to go the site at certain times and cannot pray there, while Muslims can access it at almost all times. Jewish visits to the site are a constant source of tension.

Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, spoke after the attack and both appealed for calm following the violence at the sensitive site.
Mr Abbas condemned the attack but also called on Israel to re-open the mosque and allow Friday prayers to go ahead. Israeli authorities refused, saying they needed to search the complex for weapons.
Mr Netanyahu said he remained committed to the status quo agreement at the mosque complex. Israel has always denied it has any plans change the agreement, which has more or less held for fifty years.

Reuven Rivlin, the Israeli president, said: ""We cannot allow for agents of murder, who desecrate the name of God, to drag us into a bloody war, and we will deal with a heavy hand against all the arms of terror, and its perpetrators.""
The most senior Islamic cleric at the mosque, Mohammed Hussein, was taken into custody by Israeli troops but released later in the day.
Police sealed most of the gates of Jerusalem’s Old City after the attack and many Muslim worshippers prayed in the streets in 91F (33C) heat.
Mahmoud Abu Khdeir, a 74-year-old Palestinian man from Jerusalem, prayed in the street when he was not allowed to go to the mosque.
Asked what he thought of the attack, he replied: ""We say it is good and it is bad. It's good because for the young men who did it, they are heroic and fought the occupation. It's not good because al-Aqsa is a house of God and it's Friday, the holy day, and people came from all over to pray.""

The two police officers killed were both from Israel’s Druze minority. They were named as Kamil Shnaan, 22, the son of a former Israeli member of parliament and Haiel Sitawe, who became a father three weeks ago.
They were both buried on Friday night, just hours after their deaths.
A wave of unrest that broke out in October 2015 has claimed the lives of at least 277 Palestinians, 42 Israelis, two Americans, two Jordanians, an Eritrean, a Sudanese and a Briton, according to an AFP toll.
Israeli authorities say most of the Palestinians killed were carrying out knife, gun or car-ramming attacks.
Others were shot dead in protests and clashes, while some were killed in Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip.
The violence has greatly subsided in recent months.

"President Trump’s Attorney Marc Kasowitz, Pulls Back Complaint Against Comey","President Trump’s personal outside attorney, Marc Kasowitz, has revealed that the duo is now postponing their plan to file a complaint against former FBI Director James Comey with the Justice Department. Kasowitz is defending Trump against Mueller’s criminal investigation into Trump’s alleged obstruction of justice, and has also been advising Trump aides in relation to the Russia probes.
The complaint Trump wanted to file, was based on Comey’s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, in which he detailed the methods he used, as a private citizen, to provide the media with the contents of the memos he created, based on his conversations with President Trump.
If you recall, Trump had jumped all over Comey’s decision to go public with his memos, by slandering him and calling him a “leaker.” Trump’s lack of understanding of the law, made him believe that Comey had done something illegal. The reality is that the vast majority of anonymous leaks are fully legal, and are recognized as protected speech by the U.S. Supreme Court. The only leaks you’ll really get in trouble for, are leaks about classified information.
When Comey admitted that he gave his memos to a friend to be “leaked” to the press, it was legal. The information was not classified as a matter of a federal law, giving him the right to release it anonymously through a friend. Whether Trump knew this when he threatened Comey is irrelevant, all that matters is that fact that Trump was willing to make empty threats to intimidate a person who would end up being a federal witness, if he ends up being charged with obstruction.
One thing to remember with lawyers, is that they have to serve their clients, and move forward with the legal action that their client wants, even if they think the client has no chance. A client presents their facts to the lawyer, and the lawyer advises them about what they should do. But the client doesn’t have to listen, as Trump clearly did not when he threatened Comey with legal action.
Trump has a history of making empty legal threats against his opponents, and then not following through. Trump threatened legal action against 11 women who accused him of sexual assault not so long ago. Pulling back his attack on Comey, makes him look like a fool. Why take any of his threats seriously? He lies and makes empty threats constantly, and does nothing.

"Trump, Modi seek rapport despite friction on trade, immigration","FILE PHOTO: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi gestures during a session of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF), Russia, June 2, 2017.

WASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold their first face-to-face meeting in Washington on Monday, seeking to boost U.S.-Indian relations despite differences over trade, the Paris climate accord and immigration.
Their White House session promises less pomp than Modi's previous visits to Washington, which included former President Barack Obama taking him to the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial in 2014. It is Modi's fifth trip to the United States as prime minister.
""This meeting is, above all, an introduction, an opportunity for the two men to meet each other, to size each other up, and to get a sense of how each one views the other and the bilateral relationship on the whole,"" said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at The Wilson Center.
Trump administration officials have pointed to both leaders' impact on social media - each has more than 30 million Twitter followers - as proof that they are cut from the same cloth, and predicted the two would get along well.
Trump built a Trump Tower property in Mumbai and spoke warmly of India during his presidential campaign last year.
""The White House is very interested in making this a special visit,"" said one senior official. ""We’re really seeking to roll out the red carpet,""
Modi will try to strengthen ties that have appeared to loosen. Indian officials, noting both men's tendency to speak their mind, were anxious to see how they get along.
They will have one-on-one talks followed by statements to the news media without taking questions. They will then have a working dinner, the first time Trump has played host to a foreign dignitary at a White House dinner.
""If the chemistry is good, everything else gets sorted,"" said an Indian official. ""The only way is up. How much up we go depends on the leaders. If they click, we go up higher.""
Five U.S. senators, four Republicans and one Democrat, signed a letter to Trump expressing concern about violations of religious liberty in India, including discrimination against religious-based aid groups, and asking him to make the issue a top priority during Modi's visit.
The letter was signed by Republicans John Kennedy, Roy Blunt, Mike Crapo and James Lankford, and Democrat Amy Klobuchar.
Sikh organizations planned a protest in front of the White House on Monday.
While progress is expected in defense trade and cooperation, there are frictions elsewhere.
Trump, who campaigned on an ""America First"" platform, has been troubled by the growing U.S. trade deficit with India. He has called for reform of the H-1B visa system, which has benefited Indian tech firms.
He set the United States on a path to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement and accused India of negotiating unscrupulously for the accord in order to walk away with billions of dollars in aid.
Meanwhile, Indian officials reject suggestions that Modi's ""Make in India"" platform is protectionist and complain about the U.S. regulatory process for generic pharmaceuticals and rules on fruit exports to the United States.
They stress the importance of the huge Indian market to U.S. companies and major growth in areas such as aviation, which offer significant opportunities for U.S. manufacturers.
Rick Rossow, an India expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the frictions in U.S.-Indian relations since Trump took office on Jan. 20 add gravity to the meeting.
""The meeting will provide more clarity on whether the past six months have been Act 1 in a surprising friendship or Round 1 of a protracted slugging match,"" he said.

“Vajacials” Are The Next Hot Thing For Female Empowerment,"You’ve got to be freaking kidding me. Women actually pay for this? Stupid and gross. Who wants a stranger doing this to them? Evidently comedian Jenny Slate and the Lenny Letter (of Lena Dunham infamy) did just that… and they wanted to share it with all of us in Good Housekeeping, y’all. SMH. They say it is all about female empowerment. This is not the world I envisioned living it. Nope.
First off, we are treated to a discussion of how much she loves soap and hygiene. Yeah, don’t we all. Then she dives into the trials of having a vagina: “I’ve always been afraid that someone will tell someone else that I have a bad smell. This stems from overhearing those high school boys who want both to have sex with a vagina but also to disparage one.” Okay, we haven’t even started and I’m offended AND grossed out. Who goes on about such things? Then of course comes the waxing poetic over a “Vajacial.” I can feel generations of women simply cringe over this.
From Good Housekeeping (how far they have fallen):
This is what I was thinking as I drove myself to get my very first-ever, and probably only-ever “Vajacial.” The Vajacial is billed as a facial, but for your vagina. I wasn’t sure how major it was going to be. I enjoy getting my face cleaned, and I like the idea of deep, weird dirts getting taken out of my face skin so that I can have a clean face to show everyone. But my vagina is, well, not a face. I don’t prefer to show it to everyone, and I do enjoy bathing it without any help.
The fact that The Vajacial exists seems to insist that we need it. And although nobody can intimidate me about my vagina anymore like that 17-year-old boy did in the ’90s, I started to feel intimidated by the creeping unknown of: “What if there is something off about me and my body and I don’t know about it? And my happiness is about to be ruined?”
These women are fixated on their female bits. They are having an existential crisis over their unmentionables. I’d laugh if it wasn’t so very, very pathetic… and embarrassing. I’m not going to explain the whole process… if I did, I’d have to knock myself out to forget it. But it involves baby powder, moisturizer, tweezers and peeling. No way in hell would a normal woman do this.
What is really insane, is this woman’s response to it all: “I guess I was generally excited to show my vagina to a new, nice, nonpredatory person, so there’s that. It’s A-OK to try new things for your body and to be curious about the world of grooming.” Perverse much? She needs approval of her down under because she is uber insecure about it.

July 28, 2017 4:09 PM
The resounding Senate crash of the seven-year Republican drive to scrap the Obama health care law incited GOP finger-pointing Friday but left the party with wounded leaders and no evident pathway forward on an issue that won't go away.
In an astonishing cliff-hanger, the GOP-run Senate voted 51-49 to reject Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's last ditch attempt to sustain their drive to dismantle President Barack Obama's health care overhaul with a starkly trimmed-down bill. The vote, which concluded shortly before 2 a.m. EDT, was a blistering defeat for President Donald Trump and McConnell, R-Ky., who've made uprooting the statute a top priority.
""They should have approved health care last night,"" Trump said Friday during a speech in Brentwood, New York. ""But you can't have everything,"" he added, seemingly shrugging off one of his biggest legislative setbacks.
Trump reiterated his threat to ""let Obamacare implode,"" an outcome he could hasten by steps like halting federal payments to help insurers reduce out-of-pocket costs for lower-earning consumers.
Senate Democrats were joined in opposition by three Republicans — Maine's Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Arizona's John McCain. The 80-year-old McCain, just diagnosed with brain cancer, had returned to the Capitol three days earlier to provide a vote that temporarily kept the measure alive, only to deliver the coup de grace Friday.
""3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down,"" Trump tweeted Friday. He tweeted later that the Senate needed a rules change to ""immediately go to a 51 vote majority, not senseless 60,"" even though on the crucial vote a simple majority of 51 votes, including a tie-breaker by Vice President Mike Pence, was all that was needed.
""Hello, he only needed 51 in the health care bill and couldn't do it,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., helpfully reminded reporters.
Earlier in the week, Republican defections sank two broad GOP efforts to scrap the 2010 law. One would have erased Obama's statute and replaced it with a more constricted government health care role, and the other would have annulled the law and given Congress two years to replace it.
The measure that fell Friday was narrower and included a repeal of Obama's unpopular tax penalties on people who don't buy policies and on employers who don't offer coverage to workers. McConnell designed it as a legislative vehicle the Senate could approve and begin talks with the House on a compromise, final bill.
But the week's setbacks highlighted how, despite years of trying, GOP leaders haven't resolved internal battles between conservatives seeking to erase Obama's law and moderates leery of tossing millions of voters off of coverage.
""It's time to move on,"" McConnell said after the defeat.
Friday morning, House leaders resorted to singer Gordon Lightfoot to point fingers. They opened a House GOP meeting by playing ""The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,"" a ballad about the 1975 sinking of a freighter in Lake Superior. Lawmakers said leaders assured them it was meant as a reference to the Senate's flop.
The House approved its health care measure in May, after its own tribulations.
In a statement, Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., pointedly said ""the House delivered a bill.""
He added, ""I encourage the Senate to continue working toward a real solution that keeps our promise.""
Conservative Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., running for a Senate seat, faulted McConnell for not crafting a plan that could pass. He said if McConnell abandons the health care drive, ""he should resign from leadership.""
One moderate Republican said Trump shared responsibility.
""One of the failures was the president never laid out a plan or his core principles and never sold them to the American people,"" said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa. ""Outsourced the whole issue to Congress.""
In statements Friday, McCain said the Senate bill didn't lower costs or improve care and called the chamber's inability to craft wide-ranging legislation ""inexcusable."" He said Democrats and Republicans should write a bill together and ""stop the political gamesmanship.""
Lawmakers spoke of two possible but difficult routes forward.
In one, balking GOP senators could be won over by new proposals from leaders or cave under pressure from angry constituents demanding they fulfill the party's pledge to tear down Obama's law. But both of those dynamics have been in play all year without producing results.
In the other, there would be a limited bipartisan effort to address the insurance market's short-term concerns. That would provide money to insurers to help them subsidize some customers and prevent companies from driving up premiums or abandoning regions.
Schumer said he hoped the two parties could ""work together to make the system better"" by stabilizing marketplaces.
But many conservatives oppose such payments and consider them insurance industry bailouts, raising questions about whether Congress could approve such a package.
McConnell said it was time for Democrats ""to tell us what they have in mind."" But saying he was backed by most Republicans, he added, ""Bailing out insurance companies, with no thought of any kind of reform, is not something I want to be part of.""

"Moments After ObamaCare Vote, Melania Took The Stage In Ohio And Left The Crowd Speechless","Image Source: Right Side Broadcasting Network
Our country took a huge first step in repealing ObamaCare today, and to follow up in the glorious victory for our country and President Trump took the stage in Ohio where they were already scheduled to hold a rally.
But before President Trump spoke, First Lady Melania took the stage beside her husband and gave a speech that had the entire crowd out of their seats cheering.
Melania talked about the resolve of her husband to fulfill his promises and that he never gives up.
She also said that the age of prosperity and economic growth that defined our country as the land of opportunity is going to return.
And right after she gave her speech, President Trump walked up to her gushing with joy and kissed her.
The crowd couldn’t stop cheering!
Watch the video here:
The First Lady is exactly right that President Trump doesn’t give up on his promises. The economy has been setting record months of unemployment and on the stock market as well as him fighting to secure our borders and get rid of Sanctuary cities.
And now the Senate has passed the ObamaCare repeal taking a major step towards ensuring the future growth of our economy rather than it being crippled by the broken and horrible program.
It’s safe to say Trump is keeping his promises.

Those 3 Muslim Brothers Arrested for Spying on Trump Were HIRED BY OBAMA,"Folks, I am sure you heard about the 3 Muslim brothers Abid, Imran, and Jamal Awan that were accessing computers without the authority to do so, and may have seen classified information.

They are currently being investigated for ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, and they may have funneled information from the House of Representatives onto an external server. (via Breitbart)
It is also believed the individuals are responsible for theft and the overpricing of computer equipment, the extra money no doubt going into their pockets! The three brothers, and the wife of Imran, made around $160,000 a year as information technology employees of the House.
Even though they were being paid quite a bit of money, their financial activity is suspicious, including mortgage transfers and evading debt with bankruptcy. Abid was a million dollars in debt after a failed business venture, through this business it is believed he stole money and vehicles. (via Daily Caller)
This business, which was an automobile business, was reportedly being run while he was working for Congress, which seems hard to believe. He has been on the payroll of the government for years, but despite his failed illicit business, he was still able to be an employee of Congress.
How did the Obama administration allow these criminals to slip through the cracks? These people were doing many illicit acts that the government should have caught, but because of Obama and his soft spot for Muslims, they looked the other way. Who knows what information they have gleaned from the government’s servers.

"Caught! They Are Guilty, Guilty As Charged – See Who’s Now Facing Up To 10 Years In Prison For Stealing","It’s been said that steep punishments for wrongdoing are not an obstacle, that individuals will commit acts of brutality regardless of the punishment. There is additionally a school of believed that expresses that death penalty, or capital punishment, likewise will do nothing toward diminishing the event of wrongdoing.
In specific states where leniency appears, the wrongdoing measurements seem to show that there is a probability of more wrongdoing, as well as that the recidivism rate (or the rehash offense part of wrongdoing) is likewise more in those areas.
In New Jersey, a crime-duo has been arrested for assault and robbery. The thieves knew the casualty and they were rough in their assault. The kicker to this one is that they will both be confronting a potential 5-10 year sentence. What was justified regardless of this fierce battery? A cell phone and $16!
A New Jersey man and woman could spend five to 10 years in prison for stealing a cellphone and $ 16 last week, according to Thursday reports.
Anthony J. Stackow, 37, allegedly punched the victim in the face and body while Alyssa Santiago, 32, rifled through the victim’s pockets to steal the cellphone and $ 16 cash, the Jersey Journal reported Wednesday. Stackow also faces a criminal mischief charge for smashing the cellphone on the ground.
The pair’s first appearance in court on Tuesday determined that they would be detained for the course of their prosecution. The case will be heard in court by a superior court judge Thursday.
The couple stands accused of second-degree robbery, which carries a five to 10 year sentence. Stackow’s additional criminal mischief charge could add to his sentence, however.
The victim, whose identity was not released, told authorities he recognized Stackow and Santiago as his cousin’s friends. He declined medial treatment despite Stackow’s alleged violence.
For this situation, regardless of the potential charges, see that the casualty has picked not to look for restorative treatment. Much of the time this way, where the casualty knows the culprit and where medicinal treatment is not looked for, it comes from the accept with respect to the casualty that on the off chance that they do get treatment, the courts may force a more prominent sentence (which is in some cases genuine).
On the off chance that the casualty has been through this kind of circumstance sometime recently, or knows somebody who has, the odds that the culprit has discharged on a detail or discharged before may encourage this discernment that not looking for therapeutic care is shrewd. Regardless, these two will confront a firm sentence in any case.

THIS IS IT!! Hillary’s Fundraiser Arrested For Child Rape – Case Leads Straight to OBAMA,"This is DISGUSTING!! Hillary and Obama are BOTH implicated in this sex scandal, from who they know and support to those who they do business with. Why didn’t the national news run this EVERYWHERE?? This is huge and you’ve never seen it till now.
The corruption in our government is getting out of hand…Trump can’t get into office soon enough…..
Terrence Bean who was a fundraising “Bundler” for both Obama and Hillary was arrested for child rape. A “bundler” is someone who not only donates money to a campaign or politician but solicits and “bundles” donations from other donors into a large sum of money. As such, bundlers are key players who provide an important service for politicians.
2 years ago donor and “Bundler” Terrence Patrick Bean, who helped Obama in his re-election, was arrested for child rape. Oh, you haven’t heard about this story till now? That’s because mainstream media would never give it the attention it deserves. If a “bundler” for Trump got arrested for pedophilia, you’d better believe it would be in all major news outlets.
On November 20th 2014, Terrence Patrick Bean was arrested. Portland, Ore. police charged him with two felony counts of having sex with a minor ( a 15-year-old boy) in 2013. Bean’s Ex-boyfriend, 25-year-old Kiah Loy Lawson, was also arrested for sexual abuse of the same boy. This man is not just any old guy accused of having sex with a 15-year-old – he’s a big-money Democratic donor and liberal political activist with connections inside the Obama White House.
Terrence raised more than a half-million dollars for the Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign. So to say he has connections to the white house is an understatement. He can be seen in this photograph flying on Air Force One with Obama.
You have to be pretty close to the president to get this kind of special treatment.
The Federal Election Commission’s campaign-finance database shows that Bean has donated thousands of dollars every election cycle to the Democratic Party’s most powerful leaders, including Hillary and Bill Clinton.
Terrence can be seen in this photo shoulder to shoulder with the Clinton’s.
Terrence is also an influential figure in gay rights circles in the state of Oregon. He helped found two major national political groups, the Human Rights Campaign and the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund.
The Terrence Bean child rape charges were covered in the local press, but the national news didn’t pick it up. If a Republican President’s donor were to have the same charges the media would have created a hailstorm of coverage. Given the severity of the allegations that is exactly the coverage, the Terrence Bean child rape charges should have gotten. It seems there is a double standard in the national media’s coverage of Democratic vs. republican scandals.",Freedom’s Final Stand,1
"Boko Haram kills, abducts people during ambush of oil exploration convoy","APJuly 27, 2017, 7:50 AM
 
This file photo taken on June 17, 2016 shows Nigerian servicemen patrolling through empty streets and deserted houses after the population fled following attacks by Boko Haram.
MAIDUGURI, Nigeria -- Boko Haram extremists ambushed an oil exploration convoy in northern Nigeria, killing about 10 soldiers and abducting 10 geological surveyors, officials said Wednesday. One said at least seven people were rescued and many attackers killed in a shootout that followed.
The ambush came several weeks after the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation's management announced it was resuming oil exploration around Lake Chad following assurances by Nigeria's military that security had improved in the area once under Boko Haram's control.
Islamic extremist group Boko Haram has killed thousands in towns and villages in Nigeria's north
The secretary of the Hunters Association in Borno State, Bunu Bukar, said members of the self-defense group saw the bodies of military personnel after the ambush Tuesday.
""What I can confidently confirm to you is that the insurgents came in new vehicles and fully dressed in military uniforms,"" Bukar said.
The military and self-defense group were providing security for the oil exploration workers. Nigeria's military did not immediately comment.
NNPC spokesman Ndu Ughamadu said only one of 10 geological surveyors who were abducted had been found. But the council chairman of Magumeri local government area, Zanna Modu, said soldiers were able to rescue four self-defense workers, two NNPC personnel and a staffer with the University of Maiduguri.
A large number of Boko Haram fighters were killed in the shootout, Modu said.
Boko Haram's eight-year insurgency has killed more than 20,000 people and continues to carry out deadly attacks despite the government's declaration late last year that the extremists had been ""crushed.""

Trump says regrets hiring AG after Russia probe recusal,"Washington – US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he never would have hired Attorney General Jeff Sessions if he had known the top law official would recuse himself from a probe into Russia’s alleged election meddling.
In an interview with the New York Times, the president also criticized Sessions’ recent testimony before a Senate panel which is investigating possible collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign, saying he had given “some bad answers.”
Sessions recused himself from overseeing the Russian probe in March after the Washington Post reported that he met twice with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the campaign.
But Trump said Sessions had acted unfairly in taking the job in the first place if he had felt in any way compromised.
“How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused himself before the job, I would have said, ‘Thanks, Jeff, but I’m not going to take you,'” Trump said.

France to appeal Google tax ruling,"Paris – The French government will appeal a court ruling that US internet giant Google is not liable for 1.12 billion euros ($1.27 billion) in taxes claimed by the state, Budget Minister Gerald Darmanin said Thursday.
“We will appeal this ruling to safeguard the interests of the state,” Darmanin told parliament.
The court ruled Wednesday that France could not claim tax on revenues generated by Google in France that were transferred to its Irish subsidiary GIL.
Taxes are far lower in Ireland, a legal loophole prized by many multinationals in Europe.

The Latest on the controversy surrounding a meeting last summer between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer promising damaging information on Hillary Clinton (all times local):
Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee are questioning the Trump administration's decision to settle a money laundering case with a Russian real estate firm in light of revelations that the company was represented by the same Russian lawyer who met last year with President Donald Trump's son.
The letter sent by House Judiciary ranking member John Conyers and other Democrats asks whether lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was involved in settlement negotiations between Russian real estate firm Prevezon Holdings Ltd. and the Justice Department. Prevezon agreed last May to pay $6 million to the government to avoid a trial on charges the firm laundered proceeds from a $230 million tax fraud.
Veselnitskaya represented Dennis Katsyv, Prevezon's owner. Katsyv backed a lobbying campaign last year aimed at scuttling Magnitsky Act sanctions against Russian interests.
The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee says he and the panel's top Democrat have agreed to bring former Trump campaign official Paul Manafort before the panel.
In an interview with Iowa reporters, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa says Manafort was at a meeting involving President Donald Trump's son and a Russian lawyer. The Republican senator says he has several questions and the panel would subpoena Manafort if necessary.
Grassley said he and Sen. Dianne Feinstein are working closely on it.
According to emails released Tuesday by Donald Trump Jr., he appeared eager to accept information from the Russian government that could have damaged Hillary Clinton's campaign.
House Speaker Paul Ryan is deflecting questions about the latest revelation of President Donald Trump's son meeting last June with a Russian lawyer for possible dirt on Hillary Clinton.
Ryan told reporters on Wednesday that it's important to get to the bottom of what happened, but that's a job for special counsel Robert Mueller and the congressional intelligence committees.
According to emails released Tuesday by Donald Trump Jr., he appeared eager to accept information from the Russian government that could have damaged Clinton's campaign.
Ryan said it is ""absolutely unacceptable"" that Russia meddled in the presidential election. He said it was ""very important that these professionals do their jobs"" in the investigations.
President Donald Trump is pushing back against any reports of dysfunction in his administration, writing on Twitter that the White House is ""functioning perfectly, focused on HealthCare, Tax Cuts/Reform & many other things.""
The president, who typically watches a steady diet of news on cable television, adds that he has ""very little time for watching T.V.""
Trump was spending part of his morning responding to reports that he has raged against the latest development with Russia. He has defended the meeting that his eldest son had last June with a Russian lawyer that appear to show Donald Trump Jr. was eager to accept information from the Russian government to damage Hillary Clinton's campaign.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov says he is surprised that Donald Trump Jr. is facing controversy for meeting with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Speaking at a news conference in Brussels, Lavrov said didn't he understand why the meeting, which Trump Jr. has acknowledged, was becoming such a large issue. Lavrov asked, ""What is the problem here?""
President Donald Trump's eldest son revealed Tuesday that he was eager to hear damaging information about Hillary Clinton from the Russian government, disclosing a series of emails that showed him conversing with a music publicist who wanted him to meet with a ""Russian government attorney"" who supposedly had dirt on Clinton.
The lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya denies having any compromising information about Clinton.
Lavrov referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin's earlier comments that the current controversy was the result of someone ""trying to contest the election results.""
President Donald Trump's lawyer is defending the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., saying he did not violate any laws in his meeting with a Russian lawyer.
Attorney Jay Sekulow says that the president was not aware of Trump Jr.'s June 2016 meeting and didn't find out about his son's email exchange until ""very recently.""
Sekulow says the president is not being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller.
The attorney is defending Trump, his son and their associates in the aftermath of the revelation of Trump Jr.'s meeting — along with former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump son-in-law and top adviser Jared Kushner — to discuss allegedly compromising information about Hillary Clinton.
Sekulow spoke on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" and NBC's ""Today.""
The Kremlin has denied reaching out to a Moscow-based property developer and his son who arranged a meeting between a Russian lawyer and Donald Trump Jr. to discuss allegedly compromising information about Hillary Clinton.
The emails published by Trump Jr. show publicist Rob Goldstone telling Trump that singer Emin Agalarov and his father, developer Aras Agalarov, had ""helped along"" the Russian government's support for Trump. In his email, Goldstone said that the ""Crown prosecutor of Russia"" offered to provide the information on Clinton to the Trump campaign in a meeting with Aras Agalarov.
Speaking to reporters Wednesday in Moscow, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov, insisted that the Kremlin has not spoken to Agalarov and has no ties to the Russian lawyer who was at the meeting.
President Donald Trump is defending son Donald Trump Jr. in regards to the Russia investigation, writing on Twitter that his son was ""open, transparent and innocent.""
The president is again calling the investigation the ""greatest Witch Hunt in political history.""
Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday morning in the aftermath of his son's defense of a meeting he had last June with a Russian lawyer. According to emails released by Trump Jr., he appeared eager to accept information from the Russian government that would have damaged Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign.
The incident has raised questions of whether members of Trump's campaign coordinated with Russia to hurt Clinton and help Trump.
Donald Trump's eldest son has revealed he was eager to hear damaging information about Hillary Clinton from the Russian government, disclosing a series of emails that marked the clearest sign to date that Trump's campaign was willing to consider election help from a longtime U.S. adversary.
The email exchange posted to Twitter Tuesday by Donald Trump Jr. showed him conversing with a music publicist who wanted him to meet with a ""Russian government attorney"" who supposedly had dirt on Clinton as ""part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump."" The messages reveal that Trump Jr. was told the Russian government had information that could ""incriminate"" Clinton and her dealings with Russia.
""I love it,"" Trump Jr. said in one email response.

"Adopted Boy Found Weighing 29 Pounds, Then Cops Make 2nd Horrid Discovery About Him","July 12, 2017JodiCops & Criminals, U.S. News
Image for the purpose of visual representation only (left); the home where an adopted 5-year-old was starved and tortured by Bradley Fahrenkrug, 40, and Kimberly Fahrenkrug, 38 (right).
A Wisconsin couple was charged on Monday after they apparently adopted a boy just so that they could starve and torture him inside their house of horrors. The 5-year-old was found weighing just 29 pounds, but cops soon made a second horrid discovery about him that will make your gut churn.
Bradley Fahrenkrug, 40, and Kimberly Fahrenkrug, 38, of Wrightstown, were hit with a number of child abuse charges on Monday after allegedly starving and torturing their 5-year-old adopted son. The abuse had resulted in several hospital visits for the boy since October of last year.
The married couple are accused of making the five-year-old wear a helmet, compression vest, flippers and a backpack filled with weights and ordering him to march and do other exercises.
He was also given only a small amount of food to eat while the couple’s other children could eat as they pleased, according to criminal complaints.
The boy was often allegedly ‘swaddled’ in a crib so he wouldn’t be able to get out and get food [Source: Daily Mail]
The 5-year-old was admitted to Children’s Hospital in Madison in April weighing just 29 pounds. The Fahrenkrugs claimed that he had simply quit eating, but authorities soon discovered there was something more sinister at play when Kimberly Fahrenkrug grew angry with hospital staff for giving the boy food.
According to criminal complaints, Barbara Knox, a physician and child abuse expert at Children’s Hospital, told investigators that the 5-year-old had experienced the “most egregious example of child starvation and torture” that she had ever seen.
The Fahrenkrugs both faced Brown County Circuit Court via video link from prison on Monday, where they were charged with five felonies over their adopted son’s abuse.
Fortunately, the boy did not die of malnourishment, but Knox said his current medical condition puts him at “risk of great bodily harm and/or death,” so he is not in the clear just yet. The hospital said he was being monitored for a condition known as “refeeding syndrome,” which is sparked by severe malnutrition, and ordered that he be given unrestricted access to food.
The Fahrenkrugs described their son as “controlling, demanding, and abnormal,” but hospital staff saw nothing of the sort, which certainly adds to suspicions about the parents. Authorities found the boy to be “sweet, polite, and very normal.”
Both parents are charged with five felonies in Brown County Circuit Court, including first-degree reckless injury, causing mental harm to a child, first-degree recklessly endangering safety, child neglect resulting in great bodily harm and false imprisonment. [Source: The Washington Post]
When there are so many good people struggling to have children and others who wait years and spend thousands of dollars trying to adopt, stories such as this one make your blood boil, and rightfully so. The Fahrenkrugs deserve to be locked up for the rest of their natural lives. Anyone who could torture an innocent and helpless child is a monster, plain and simple.

"McConnell announces plan for Obamacare repeal with ""stable"" two-year transition period","Last Updated Jul 18, 2017 11:26 AM EDT
Hours after the addition of two Senators' ""no"" votes of the Senate's latest iteration of their health care plan, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell took the Senate floor to announce his next steps toward repealing the Affordable Care Act, in an effort he says will bring relief to Americans who ""suffered"" under Obamacare.
""We worked hard to provide them with a better way, we did so in the knowledge that this task would not be easy, we understood it would not come quickly. But we knew it was the right thing to do so we pushed forward anyway,"" said McConnell on Tuesday. He added, ""I believe we must continue to push forward now.""
McConnell acknowledged his party's inability to offer a simultaneous repeal-and-replace plan for Obamacare, saying he regretted the effort was not successful. He added, ""That doesn't mean we should give up.""
""We will now try a different way to bring the American people relief from Obamcare, I think we owe them that much. The Senate will take up and vote on a repeal of Obamacare combined with a stable two-year transition period as we work toward patient-centered health care.""
The legislation which McConnell proposed, was previously backed by a majority of Republicans in 2015, but was vetoed by then-President Obama. ""President Trump will sign it now,"" McConnell urged.
The Republican leader also took time to slap at his Democratic colleagues, who McConnell said he imagined were ""celebrating"" the bill's failure Monday evening.
""I hope they consider what they are celebrating. The American people are hurting, they need relief and it's regretful our Democratic colleagues did not want to engage with us seriously to deliver that relief. But this doesn't have to be the end of this story,"" said McConnell.
He went on to say that by passing the Senate's new legislation, it would provide an opportunity for senators ""of all parties to engage with a fresh start and new beginning.""
In response to McConnell's claims that Democrats were unwilling to work with Republicans on health care, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer took to the floor as well, saying early on in the process of health care reform, McConnell told Democrats, ""we don't need you, we don't want you.""
""Respectfully, I take issue with the idea Democrats didn't want to engage on health care, the Majority Leader admitted he decided the matter for us when he locked Democrats out of process at the outset,"" said Schumer.
He added, ""Now that their one-party effort largely failed, we hope they will change their tune.""
Schumer added that by passing a repeal without a replacement plan would be a ""disaster"" to America's health care system.
""Passing a repeal now is not a door to bipartisan solutions,"" Schumer added. ""The door to bipartisanship is open right now with a new efffort to improve the existing system. The door is open right now, Republican leadership just need to walk through it.""

Hot mic captures down and dirty gossip between Senators Collins and Reed about colleagues,"July 25, 2017 | BPR Wire | Print Article
Two senators were caught trash talking a Texas Republican representative while the microphones were recording after an appropriations markup Tuesday.
Democratic Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed and Maine Republican Susan Collins each took swipes at Texas Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold after he said Monday that if Collins were a man they would settle their differences on the Obamacare repeal bill with a duel.
“Did you see the one who challenged me to a duel?” Collins said to Reed, apparently referencing Farenthold.
“I know,” Reed said in the recorded audio. “You know why he challenged you to a duel? ‘Cause you could beat the shit out of him.”
“Well, he’s huge. And he — I don’t mean to be unkind, but he’s so unattractive, it’s unbelievable,” Collins responded. “Did you see the picture of him in his pajamas next to this bunny?” Farenthold was photographed at a 2010 campaign event wearing in pajamas with yellow ducks printed on them, standing next to a lingerie model.

— JM Rieger (@RiegerReport) July 25, 2017
The exchange between Reed and Collins, first pointed out by The Hill’s reporter Niv Elis, happened during a markup of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2018.
Farenthold blamed Collins and “some female senators from the Northeast” for derailing the repeal of Obamacare in the Senate.
“If it was a guy from south Texas, I might ask him to step outside and settle this Aaron Burr-style,” Farenthold told the Associated Press Monday.
Farenthold apologized for his comments in a handwritten note Tuesday, Collins told The Daily Caller News Foundation in a statement.
“I received a handwritten apology from Rep. Farenthold late this morning,” Collins said. “I accept his apology, and I offer him mine.”
“Neither weapons nor inappropriate words are the right way to resolve legislative disputes,” Collins said.
About 36 minutes into the audio-only recording Tuesday, Collins and Reed discussed how the House of Representatives was handling the budget deal, and how Republicans have said very little about the impending debt ceiling.
The two hit President Donald Trump for his budget and being crazy.
“I swear, the OMB [Office of Management and Budget] just went through and whenever there was ‘grant,’ the just X it out,” Collins said of OMB director Mick Mulvaney’s approach to the president’s budget.
“Yes. I think — I think he’s crazy,” Reed said, apparently referring to Trump. “I mean, I don’t say that lightly and as a kind of a goofy guy.”
“I’m worried,” Collins said.

Republicans Are Now Hurting The Sick As A Publicity Stunt – The SHOCKING Real Evidence!,"Republicans, explains Mother Jones reporter Patrick Caldwell, are telling everyone in America that Congress needs to repeal Obamacare immediately because the program’s insurance markets collapse.
“The situation has never been more dire,” Tom Price crocodile-wept to the press this week. “Americans are continuing to lose what health coverage they have and are forced to choose from fewer options or pay the IRS for the right to go without.”
President Trump has said that the GOP should “let Obamacare crash and burn.”
However, reports Caldwell, that is actually all a deception – Republicans are actively working to hurt people who use Obamacare, just so they can prove a sick point about government aid to the sick.
The GOP has opposed Medicaid expansion, a move that has actually driven up insurance costs by close to 10% in some markets.
Exhibit B? Republicans are cutting subsidies that Obamacare customers are entitled to.
Finally, the Trump White House has been playing coy with monthly renewals of key Obamacare funding, keeping Democrats – and needy Americans – on edge as nothing more than a political stunt.",Raw Progressive,1

The Forgotten Weapon That Helped the Allies Win World War II,"The origins of the Universal Carrier can be traced to the Ford T-powered Carden-Loyd machines developed in Great Britain in the mid-1920s, specifically the Mark VI model of 1927. When Carden-Loyd merged with Vickers-Armstrongs in 1928 the small machine-gun carrier—cramped, lightly protected, unreliable but cheap to produce—became a major component of the British Army.
In 1934 Vickers-Armstrong launched a new model carrier designated the D50. The body was limited to a two-man compartment at the front, while narrow seats, running lengthways along the track guards at the rear, would accommodate the rest of the crew of six. The engine was located in the middle of the chassis and was the standard commercial Ford V-8 linked by a four-speed and reverse gearbox also made by Ford. The suspension and steering systems were good especially when it came to cross country travel.
In 1935, Vickers-Armstrongs offered another carrier model to the British War Office. Titled the Experimental Armored Machine Gun Carrier, it was fitted with the same engine, transmission, and suspension as the D50. Armor protection was provided by 6mm of medal plate. It could carry a Vickers heavy machine-gun which could be fired from either the carrier or dismounted by its crew from a tripod.
The Carrier Machine Gun Number 1 Mark 1
Designated by the Army as Carrier Machine Gun Number 1 Mark 1, it was rapidly followed by a new version the Carrier Machine Gun Number 2 Mark 1 which weighed in at 4.5 tons, was 12 feet long, 7 feet wide, and 5 feet high. Like the former model, the latter did not have seats on the track guards, but a small compartment, protected by a raised outer hull plate, created on the left side for a third crew member. Thus there was a driver, sitting front right, the machine-gunner to his left and the third man behind him. The machine-gun mounting came with an extra shield. The Mark 2 had an enlarged gunner’s compartment at the front so that it stood out like an angular bay on to the glacis plate. This configuration made it easier for the gunner to handle his weapon, and with the raised upper section, increased his protection.
The armor of the Mark 2 was increased to 12mm thickness; its engine, a Ford V8 90 degree L Head generated 95 hp with a top speed of 30mph. It had a four speed transmission with a maximum range of 140 miles and held 20 gallons of fuel. Its maximum recommended payload was 660 pounds. The Mark 2’s modifications seem to indicate the intention was that the vehicle was to carry and fight its weapons (a Bren Gun, and anti-tank rifle) from the carrier. Within a year over 1,100 of these were built under an Army contract.
The .303 Bren Gun Added to the Configuration
In 1935 the British Army adopted a new light machinegun—the .303 Bren Gun—to replace its venerable Lewis Gun. The new automatic firearm, based on a Czech design and weighing 28 pounds, was distributed to the infantry down to platoon level. From 1937 onward, the Universal Carrier was adapted to carry the Bren Gun. By 1940 the popular and unofficial name for the Universal Carrier—”Bren Gun Carrier”—the War Office supplied ten such vehicles to each infantry battalion.
The crew of each Bren Gun Carrier consisted of three or four men: a driver, and two or three others who formed the Bren Gun Detachment. One carrier section also sported Boys anti-tank rifles. (It should be noted that each infantry section of a rifle company contained a Bren Gun, so these weapons were not exclusive to the Carrier Platoon).
Over Two Thousand in Service
Platoon strategy placed emphasis on employing the Bren Gun dismounted from the carrier, and stressed that the gun detachment had to dismount quickly to permit the carrier to withdraw to a safe place rapidly; the driver was never to leave the vehicle. Early models allowed firing from the vehicle, which had a special bracket attached to the front mounting of the machine gun and a crutch supporting the rear end. On later models the Bren Gun was not physically attached to the vehicle, merely resting on a rubber block in the weapon slot and held in place by the operator.
The start of the Second World War saw over 2,275 Universal carriers, or “Bren Gun Carriers”, in service. Many of these saw action in France in 1940, and the Middle East. By the end of 1942 a further 6,000 had rolled off the production line. That same year saw an improved version of the Universal Carrier manufactured: the Mark II. The British built 11,000 of these during the war. This new model carried a crew of four. The main difference between this and the model Number 1 Mark 1 was that the front quarter of the top rack run was totally enclosed by a valance, and increased wielding in the hull assembly made it waterproof.
International Construction Increased Productivity
Construction of the Universal Carrier was done in the United Kingdom and to a lesser extent in Canada by the Ford Motor Company. The United States did not manufacture any since U.S. law allowed American factories only to produce weapon types normally used by the U.S. armed forces.
As the war progressed, Allied command found wider uses for the Universal Carrier. British motorized battalions—units comprising a British infantry brigade, in an armored division—used carriers in their Scout Platoons for reconnaissance missions from 1944 onward. After 1941 carriers began to tot 3” mortars, 66 rounds of high explosive and smoke shells. The mortar and its five-man crew would deploy the weapon outside the carrier.

This Means WAR: The ObamaCare Betrayal by Senators Capito and Murkowski Can Never Be Forgotten or Forgiven,"As I mentioned yesterday, I am astounded that so many people want to blame the GOP’s failure to repeal ObamaCare on those who are least to blame: folks like Rand Paul and Mike Lee. As I said, the real villains are the people who voted for the ObamaCare (partial) repeal bill in 2015 — but oppose it today.
Well, Mitch McConnell will soon call for a vote on a reanimated version of that same bill. And now we’re starting to learn who the scoundrels really are.
At the top of the list of giant hypocrites, you’ll find Senators Shelly Moore Capito of West Virginia and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — who have both declared their intention to vote against the ObamaCare repeal bill that they both voted for in 2015. As Phil Kerpen said:
They should call it The Same Exact Repeal Bill You Voted for in 2015 that Obama Vetoed Act of 2017.
— Phil Kerpen (@kerpen) July 18, 2017
They have no excuse for this, and their betrayal will save ObamaCare.
BREAKING. Steve Bannon Sentenced To Death In Absentia, Giuliani Narrowly Avoids Same Fate
Capito and Murkowski are the most worthless type of hypocrites imaginable. They have postured as being against Obamacare, but they never really were. They voted in favor of the (partial) repeal in 2015 — and yet they claim they cannot vote for the same bill today, in 2017.
What is the difference between 2015 and 2017? Yesterday afternoon I sent emails to the press offices of Senators Capito and Murkowski, asking them why they would choose not to vote for the exact same bill they voted for in 2015. I received no response from Senator Capito, and a canned statement from Senator Murkowski that does not remotely begin to address the questions I had asked.
So what is the difference between 2015 and 2017? I’ll tell you what the difference is. The difference is that today, in 2017, we have a president who would sign that repeal bill into law. In 2015, we did not.
Senators Capito and Murkowski knew this. They lied to their voters, straight up.
Now: we all know that there are surely plenty of other cowards hiding behind the skirts of these two senators. (Hi, Rob Portman!) I suspect that Capito and Murkowski were chosen to be the primary fall guys (or fall gals, as it happens) because they’re not up for reelection for four years (in the case of Capito) and six years (in the case of Murkowski). I think the GOP establishment is hoping that you will forget about their treachery in the intervening four to six years.
I, for one, am not going to forget. I will never forget.
I hereby pledge to donate money to the strongest conservative challenger willing to primary either of these senators on the basis of their refusal to vote to repeal Obamacare. I don’t care if I have to wait until 2020 or 2022, I am doing it. And I will vocally support that person against these Senators, and do everything I can to see that these women are unseated.
So if there are others, why pick on Capito and Murkowski? Oh, I’m willing to do the same for anyone who votes against the repeal bill. We just don’t know who they are yet. But yes, I am focused on these two senators, because they are the ones who came out against the bill first, and will give political cover for others to do the same. We have to make an example out of somebody, so we might as well start with them — pour encourager les autres.
So here’s what we do. We primary them. We never, ever forget this betrayal. This goes for anybody else who votes against having this legislation going forward. All of them get the same treatment. No more donations for any of the turncoats. If they appear on the radio, we call in and rip them to shreds for this vote. We confront them wherever and whenever we can. We pull out all the stops.
Some, I expect, will go further. Some will simply stop voting for the GOP or donating money to the GOP. If you choose to go that route, I suggest you tell them exactly why.
One final point: some of you may be asking: why am I not screaming at Susan Collins? Am I mad at Susan and Collins? Well, sure. Of course I’m mad at Susan Collins — for being a complete economic nincompoop who is furthering a disastrous socialistic healthcare regime that is going to drive health care costs into the stratosphere and bankrupt middle America. But she didn’t vote for the 2015 bill. She didn’t pretend to be for repeal when it didn’t matter. (If you want a full list of who did vote for the bill in 2015, together with an analysis of who is still in the Senate today, I did that work for you here.)
Yes, Susan Collins might be an economic illiterate and the functional equivalent of a Democrat. But Susan Collins didn’t lie to her voters with her 2015 vote. Capito and Murkowski did. Capito and Murkowsi lied. They lied — and they must pay the price for lying.
I can’t make them pay a political price by myself. You have to join me. So I ask you:

Live: Senate stakeout as GOP health care bill collapses,"Kathryn WatsonCBS NewsJuly 18, 2017, 12:09 PM
 
Last Updated Jul 18, 2017 2:13 PM EDT
With at least four GOP senators opposing the latest Republican health care bill, the chamber's second attempt at repealing and replacing Obamacare appears dead in the water.
Senate Democrats and Republicans held their respective policy lunches Tuesday, flocked by Capitol Hill reporters wondering what comes next. It's unclear what the next step will be in addressing health care. President Trump reintroduced the idea of repealing former President Obama's signature Affordable Care Act now, and replacing it later. But it doesn't appear Republicans have the votes to do that either.
""Let Obamacare fail,"" Trump says
2 p.m. The president said he is ""disappointed"" with Republicans' failure to devise a passable health care bill. Now, he says his plan is to, ""let Obamacare fail.""
Mr. Trump made the comments next to Pence, saying he wouldn't ""own"" the collapse of his predecessor's signature bill.
""I'm not going to own it,"" he said to open a White House event with military officers. ""I can tell you that the Republicans are not going to own it. We'll let Obamacare fail and then the Democrats are going to come to us and they're going to say how do we fix it?""
Pence arrives on Capitol Hill
1:10 p.m. Vice President Mike Pence arrived on Capitol Hill at roughly 1 p.m., along with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and Mr. Trump's director of legislative affairs, Marc Short.
Pence typically attends such GOP policy lunches, but the stakes are higher than usual at Tuesday's meeting.
3 GOP senators oppose repealing Obamacare without replacing, killing that idea
12:39 p.m. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski ahead of the GOP policy lunch said she's a no on repealing Obamacare without replacing it, seemingly leaving that option dead in the water.
Other GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia had already indicated they would not vote to repeal Obamacare without simultaneously introducing a replacement plan, sending Republicans back to the drawing board on health care. Mr. Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell were considering simply rolling back Obamacare, after Senate Republicans failed twice to gather enough votes to pass replacement legislation.

"Canadian Defence Minister Harjit Singh Sajjan caught littering outside shop, left red faced after confrontation; watch video","Canada’s Defence Minister Harjit Singh Sajjan is making news for all the wrong reasons. (Reuters)
Canada’s Defence Minister Harjit Singh Sajjan is making news for all the wrong reasons, as a video of him littering outside a shop in Osoyoos, Canada is doing rounds of the internet. The Canadian Defence minister, who is of Indian origin was later confronted by the shop owner in front of whose shop he was seen littering. Sajjan was caught littering outside the shop of Harbinder Singh Gill, another man of Indian origin. Gill who filmed the minister littering outside his shop went out to confront the minister who is a part of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s cabinet.
The shop owner while speaking to the Canadian Minister said that he would have let the matter go had a common man been littering outside his shop, but he had to confront the minister as he was a very senior government functionary and that such behaviour could not be expected from a person of his stature.
Sajjan tried to defend himself by saying that he was in the parking lot as he wanted to get some meat from Gill’s shop. The shop owner turned Sajjan’s argument around by saying that the minister was an educated man and that he could read the sign which stated that the shop was closed or see that the shutter was down.
In the video which has gone viral, Sajjan can be seen eating cherries in the car and then throwing the seeds in the parking lot outside the shop. Harjit Singh Sajjan had no option but to apologise for his behaviour.",Financial Express,0
Heritage Foundation clashes with Trump on family leave,"| Jul 21, 2017, 4:51 PMShare on TwitterShare on FacebookEmail this articleShare on LinkedIn
Push would create a new entitlement program that inevitably would be abused, according to a study from the conservative think tank. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)
The conservative Heritage Foundation, normally an ally of the Trump White House, is opposing the administration's proposal for a national paid family leave law, arguing that the regulatory push, a matter of keen interest to first daughter Ivanka Trump, would create a new entitlement program that inevitably would be abused.
""A federal [paid family leave] law could minimize or dismantle existing private and state PFL provisions, and could cost federal taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars per year. To support families' access to PFL, the federal government can [instead] reduce marginal taxes, encourage flexible work arrangements and cut costly business regulations,"" the foundation said in a policy paper released Thursday.
The stance puts the foundation directly at odds with the White House. The president's budget proposal includes six weeks of paid leave for families after the birth or adoption of a child. Business lobbyists say the proposal was not mere rhetoric from the administration, as Ivanka Trump, a close adviser to her father, is a major advocate of the idea.
""The reality is that in 63 percent of American homes with children, all parents work. Providing a national guaranteed paid-leave program — with a reasonable time limit and benefit cap — isn't an entitlement, it's an investment in America's working families,"" Ivanka Trump wrote in a July 4 letter to the Wall Street Journal.
Rachel Greszler, Heritage research fellow and author of the think tank's study, said the purpose of the study was ""not specifically"" to critique the White House's policy but to simply analyze the issue.
""If the purpose had been to critique the White House's proposal, having granted that a federal policy should or will exist, we would have noted that the administration's plan contains some important components necessary to minimizing the consequences of a federal policy while appropriately targeting its benefits,"" she said.
The administration's proposal would set aside $7 billion in the unemployment insurance program to fund the effort. ""States would be required to provide six weeks of parental leave and the proposal gives states broad latitude to design and finance the program.""
The effort apparently circumvents the usual congressional budgeting process. The House Appropriations Commmittee's funding bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education did not include any funding for the effort. ""It is a mandatory program and not in our jurisdiction,"" committee spokeswoman Jennifer Hing told the Washington Examiner.
The study notes that the ""size and scope"" that a federal law would require ""would make it difficult to minimize fraud and abuse, and without shouldering any of its costs, states would have minimal incentive to curtail fraud and abuse in the system."" That would force the federal government to rein in the program, but it is not clear that it would have the political will to do.
""If governments are going to provide paid family leave, state and local governments are better equipped to do so than a federal, one-size-fits-all paid family leave policy,"" Greszler said.
Heritage argues that a federal program would be harmful to children by creating a false standard for how much time parents should spend with their children. ""A national PFL policy ... would imply that an arbitrary length of paid leave that the federal government provides is the correct level. But neither the potential benefits of parents staying home nor the potential negative consequences of parents not staying home end after a designated number of weeks or months, as paid leave policies may imply,"" the report found.

Putin says U.S. will have to cut 755 from diplomatic staff in Russia,"CBS/APJuly 30, 2017, 3:08 PM
 
Last Updated Jul 30, 2017 4:33 PM EDT
Russian President Vladimir Putin says the U.S. will have to cut its diplomatic staff in Russia by 755 under new sanctions from Moscow.
Russia's Foreign Ministry on Friday ordered a reduction by Sept. 1 in the number of U.S. diplomats in Russia. It said it is ordering the U.S. Embassy to reduce the number of embassy and consular employees in the country to 455 in response to the U.S. Senate's approval of a new package of sanctions.
""We had hoped that the situation will somehow change, but apparently if it changes, it won't be soon,"" Putin said in an interview televised on Rossiya 1, explaining why Moscow decided to retaliate. ""I thought it was the time to show that we're not going to leave it without an answer.""
It was not clear how many reassignments that would mean from the Moscow embassy and the three U.S. consulates in Russia.
New chief of staff, health care & Russia
CBS political contributor Ed O' Keefe and Republican strategist Hogan Gidley join CBSN to discuss the latest news out of the nation's capital.
Putin said in the interview that he ordered the move because he ""thought it was the time to show that we're not going to leave that without an answer.""
Putin said more than 1,000 people are currently employed at the Moscow embassy and three U.S. consulates in Russia. They include both Americans and Russians hired to work in the diplomatic offices.
The White House has offered no comment on the demanded staff cut, and instead referred all questions for comment to the State Department.
The Department of State would not comment on the number of diplomats in Russia. A State Department official said: ""It is our policy to not comment on the number of individuals serving at our missions abroad.""
CBS News' Margaret Brennan reports that a White House official confirmed President Trump is expected to sign the Russia sanctions legislation early this week, but has not yet received the official bill on his desk. In a statement late Friday, the White House said that Mr. Trump had ""read early drafts of the bill and negotiated regarding critical elements of it."" Having read the latest version, the White House said Mr. Trump intends to sign it.
Some European allies opposed to Russia sanctions bill
A bill that would slap new economic sanctions on Russia for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election is winding its way through Congress, although it's...
The bill also imposes sanctions against Iran and North Korea.
The Senate passed the bill Thursday, 98-2, two days after the House pushed the measure through by an overwhelming margin, 419-3. Both were veto-proof numbers. But the White House had objected to a key section of the bill that would mandate a congressional review if Mr. Trump attempted to ease or end the sanctions against Moscow.
The bill had somewhat put Mr. Trump in a corner, since the congressional review had been put in the bill due to a weariness from both sides of the aisle about Mr. Trump and Putin.
The legislation is aimed at punishing Moscow for interfering in the 2016 presidential election and for its military aggression in Ukraine and Syria, where the Kremlin has backed President Bashar Assad.
Putin said in his Sunday announcement that the new sanctions would cause damage to the Russia-U.S relationship.
Asked about the potential for additional sanctions against Washington, Putin described the reduction in diplomatic staff as ""painful"" and said he currently opposes further measures.
""We certainly have something to respond with and restrict those areas of joint cooperation that will be painful for the American side but I don't think we need to do it,"" he said, adding that such steps could also harm Russian interests.
Putin mentioned space and energy as the main areas where Russia and the United States have successfully pursued projects together.
Russia is open to cooperating with the U.S. on various issues including terrorism and cybercrime but instead it ""only hears unfounded accusations of meddling in U.S. domestic affairs,"" the Russian leader said.
Along with the cap on the size of its diplomatic corps in Russia, the Russian foreign ministry on Friday said it also was closing down a U.S. recreational retreat on the outskirts of Moscow as well as warehouse facilities
The diplomatic tit-for-tat started under former U.S. President Barack Obama. In response to reports of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, Obama ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats and shut down two Russian recreational retreats in the U.S.

BREAKING: Jeff Sessions Unveils NASTY Plan to Suppress Minority Vote,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions is doing his very best to turn the Department of Justice into the Department of Injustice—this time by using his authority to defend and bolster Texas’s racist voter ID laws that ONLY serve to disenfranchise voters of color. Team Trump KNOWS they’re the political minority in America, so they have to resort to racist voter suppression tactics to win elections.
Jeff Sessions has been going into overdrive in his assault against civil rights in America, doing everything he can to take our nation’s civil rights laws 60 years into the past. Sessions is too busy to be concerned with mounting a response as Attorney General to Russia’s ongoing hacks against America: he has minority votes to suppress.
Upon coming into office, practically the first thing Sessions did was drop the Obama Justice Department’s lawsuit against Texas’ blatantly racist and discriminatory voter ID laws. And now, Sessions is demanding the courts to accept this toxic law once and for all.
“In a filing Wednesday, [Sessions’s Justice Department]” asked a U.S. District Court in Corpus Christi to end legal challenges to the law,” the Dallas Morning News reports. “Federal officials say changes made to the original 2011 measure during this year’s legislative session are ‘constitutionally and legally valid.’”
How about that? Sessions is claiming this racist Texas bill is “valid,” even though it’s been struck down in federal courts three separate times since 2011 for “infringing on the voting rights of about 600,000 registered Texas voters who lacked a government-issued photo ID.”
That’s why Sessions is so full of crap here. The Constitution clearly states that EVERY American has the right to vote, but in Sessions’ mind, apparently the Constitution doesn’t apply to black or Latino voters.
So now, just as an example, Texas will let you use your gun license as an ID to vote, but not a student ID. But this CLEARLY favors older white voters while keeping younger (read: Democratic) voters of color out of voting booths. But this is JUST what Sessions and the rest of Team Trump hopes to accomplish.
Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by approximately 3 million votes. The GOP knows that they don’t have a shot in hell at repeating their shock 2016 victory if they don’t keep suppressing the hell out of minority voters.
Conservatives are quick to claim that they are more patriotic and American than Progressives. But what could possibly be more unAmerican than attacking the voting rights of American citizens?
Republicans go nuts over “MUH FREEDOM.” But THEY are the ones who are attacking liberty all across this nation.
POLL: Is Texas’ voter ID law discriminatory?
Where do you stand? Do you think this Texas voter ID law is racist against minority voters?
Please participate in our poll below! This is the time for ALL Progressives to stand up and speak out!
America is supposed to be the land of EQUALITY. If Team Trump has their way, though, everyone who isn’t wealthy and white will become second-class citizens.
Enough is enough. Disenfranchisement is an attack against our democracy, and the Resistance has to treat it as such.

Rex Tillerson targets Russia and China for being 'enablers' of North Korea's ballistic missile launch,"| Jul 28, 2017, 10:47 PMShare on TwitterShare on FacebookEmail this articleShare on LinkedIn
""As the principal economic enablers of North Korea's nuclear weapon and ballistic missile development program, China and Russia bear unique and special responsibility for this growing threat to regional and global stability,"" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Friday night charged Russia and China with enabling the latest missile launch by North Korea that was the second test of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the United States.
""As the principal economic enablers of North Korea's nuclear weapon and ballistic missile development program, China and Russia bear unique and special responsibility for this growing threat to regional and global stability,"" Tillerson said in a statement.
North Korea's launch Friday of an intercontinental missile traveled about 600 miles before falling in the Sea of Japan.
North Korea's first launch of an intercontinental missile on July 4 surprised the U.S. intelligence community, and caused it to revise its estimate of how soon Pyongyang might be able to threaten the mainland U.S. with nuclear weapons.
Russia objected to the United Nations' condemnation of the July 4 test, and disagreed that North Korea had in fact launched an intercontinental missile. Rather, Moscow said it believes North Korea fired an intermediate range ballistic missile.
After the July 4 test, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said she would not allow China and Russia to limit efforts to corral North Korea.
""[I]f you see this as a threat, if you see this for what it is — which is North Korea showing its muscle — then you need to stand strong and vote with the international community to strengthen sanctions on North Korea,"" she said. ""And if you choose not to, we will go our own path.""
Tillerson stressed a similar message after Friday's missile launch.
""All nations should take a strong public stance against North Korea, by maintaining and strengthening U.N. sanctions to ensure North Korea will face consequences for its relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them,"" Tillerson said.

Naturalize Now Wants To Make 1 Million Illegal Aliens Citizens By 2018,"You would think liberals would get the message by now. President Trump will not be funding any sanctuary cities with federal funds and the more they try to cheat the system, the worse it’s going to get.
Sanctuary cities across America are trying to get past Trump’s decision to shut them down by providing a way to stop illegal aliens from being deported. They are promising to make one million illegal aliens citizens in 2017.
This is the equivalent of stuffing the ballot box for liberals! It’s past time to start cut off all federal dollars to these cities and states that support this nonsense!
Source: Fox News Insider
The Naturalize Now initiative is aimed at preventing illegal immigrants from deportation under the Trump administration. President Trump is not against legal immigration, but has promised to crack down on illegal residency in the U.S., especially of criminals.
The cities include New York City, NY; San Francisco, CA; Seattle; Boston, MA; Chicago, IL; Dallas, TX; Jersey City, NJ; Los Angeles, CA; Miami, FL; Pittsburgh, PA; and Tucson, AZ.
Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles and other progressive elected officials have joined in the path to citizenship effort.
“We celebrate our independence on July 4, and honor the values of freedom, justice, unity, and equality that make us who we are,” Garcetti said.
The House of Representatives passed two immigration bills June 29, “Kate’s Law” and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. The bills exact harsher penalties on those who re-enter after being deported and put pressure on local governments to cooperate with feds on immigration enforcement.

Liberal ideas are always nothing more than extreme wishful thinking. With this asinine plan, they’re just looking to boost their voter rolls by creating new citizens.
Regardless of political ideology, it seems a slippery slope for states to disregard federal law. Where does it stop? If a Democrat is a president, should red states defy the federal laws established under that administration? Isn’t such a disregard for the federal law the stuff that civil wars are made of? I find it very dangerous.
One more thing: States can’t grant citizenship. And anyone that does should be arrested and jailed.

Why Trump Will Eventually FIRE Attorney General Jeff Sessions,"by Kevin Jackson | Jul 24, 2017
 
A friend and I were talking about her career path, and she said she wanted to study politics in college.
However, a professor pulled her aside to tell her she wasn’t ruthless enough.
I know her to be a devout Christian, and my knee-jerk comment to her was, “Your professor was right.”
There are honorable people in politics committed to serving. However, they are few and far between. Some people just can’t play the political game. I’m one of them. Not because I’m a goody-two-shoes. Because that’s certainly not the case. I’m highly flawed. And I will kick your ass or worse, if you wrong me. But in some instances, I have too much heart.
In life you get wronged. Usually by people who love you. But generally, they are not necessarily malicious, just desperate.
My brother hocked my TV and stereo. Further, he didn’t even have the nuts to tell me. So by the time I found out, the pawn shop owned my goods. I can attest that my brother certainly had no agenda except to not get kicked out of his apartment. I suffered for his want of residence. I forgave him. But truth be told, if I were a politico, I would have either kicked his ass or figured out a way to get even.
However, I didn’t. I’m too nice.
All this to tell you that Jeff Sessions is too nice.
I know he must have some fight in him to become a Senator. But you can bet he has people doing his dirty work. Regardless, Sessions finds himself in a swamp; the big league. And honestly, I don’t think he can handle it.
Like Spicer, Sessions doesn’t have that “I will rip off your head and sh*t down your neck” mentality needed for DC.
Which is one of the reasons I like Sessions. He goofy, but in a likable way. And you can tell that he’s very bright.
I see Sessions as a behind-the-scene person who helps with strategy. But as front man, he’s too affable.
America is under siege, and Trump is the liberator. So, he needs pure warriors. Reptilian assassins willing to do whatever it takes to put the country back into the hands of the people. Some call these people “sin-eaters.” They are ruthless, and single-minded. Loyal to a fault.
Let’s be clear; Sessions is not a sin-eater.
He’s not a fighter either.
Trump can’t handle people willing to back down, even a smidgen. He knows that giving even the smallest amount in DC shows weakness from which there is no recovery. Sessions refused to fight when John Lewis and other members of the Congressional Black Circus called him racist.
But Trump’s biggest problem with Sessions came when he recused himself from the Russia investigation. Sessions thought he was doing Trump a favor. Quite the contrary.
Trump saw that move as a “bonehead” move. Sessions was supposed to fight to the death, and put the onus on the Left to get rid of him. He made things too easy for the swamp rats.
Anyway, I predicted that Sessions will be gone soon. Or he will adapt to Trump’s style of doing things. The way President Trump sees things, if he can get all his cabinet pushing back on the Left, his administration will overwhelm them. And he’s right.

Dems File Emergency Lawsuit To Stop Trump From Protecting America's Elections,"Democrats are thrilled over the emergency lawsuit filed by EPIC yesterday. It’s designed to stop the Election Integrity Commission from investigating voter fraud and corruption.
The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) has filed an emergency lawsuit to stop President Trump’s Commission on voter fraud investigation. The center has led a serious push for privacy in the Digital Age, but this move smacks of partisan politics.
In May, Trump issued an executive order establishing the commission. Its job is to “promote fair and honest elections.” However, that doesn’t bode well for democratic electorates. As many as two-thirds of U.S. states have baulked at the request sent out by Secretary of State Kris Kobach.
He issued a letter to the secretaries of all 50 states, asking for the voter statistics. The commission wants to examine the lists that are sold to marketers which contain voter demographics and data. The information is already public.
Kobach’s simple request started a storm of violent accusations against the commission. Liberals are up in arms over privacy issues that they had no problem with when Obama was in office.
The unmasking investigation is still ongoing. It has discovered troubling facts about the Obama administration’s continuous, illegal spying on American citizens. Yet, according to leftists, that pales when compared to republican appeals for names, birthdays, and addresses, which have already been sold to commercial interests.
Democrats profess that voter fraud doesn’t exist despite the numerous convictions over the past decade.
EPIC is claiming that regardless of the information requested, the panel is violating public privacy laws. No one is actually sure how that’s possible, but it hasn’t stopped the propaganda machine from churning out catch phrases and frenzied accusations.
The L.A. Times is running an opinion piece that calls for the disbandment of the commission. The author bemoans the partisan nature of the panel, saying that “there’s little reason to think this commission can produce credible answers.”
The problem with liberals is that they think everyone else acts like they do. Naturally, an all democrat panel would skew, distort, and manipulate data in a way that would benefits their claims. What these leftists don’t understand is honesty.
Despite the fact that the commission was established by President Trump and is staffed with conservatives, their investigation would be truthful.
Butch Morgan, Pam Brunette, Beverly Shelton and Dustin Blythe were convicted in an election fraud case from the 2008 Indiana Democratic primary.
That’s not good enough for the L.A. Times. The article conveniently excluded the fact that the only information requested by the commission is the public information that states have already sold to online data brokers.
Last night, NBC News anchor Katy Tur attempted to railroad Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell. Citing a partisan survey that discounts recent convictions of voter tampering and illegal activity, Tur was emotional and completely biased.
There is an abundance of credible evidence that shows illegals voting in the presidential election, and massive fraud in Virginia, but these are only the tip of the iceberg. The problems are exactly what the commission is trying to root out. However, because Kobach also requested information on “election related crime” convictions, leftists are claiming an invasion of privacy.
The election integrity commission is Trump’s response to another campaign promise. Millions of conservatives around the country don’t trust liberal voting commissions. Democrats have been placing key collectors in positions for decades. Plus, biased elected officials have an important stake in ensuring their party gets into power.
EPIC said in the emergency lawsuit “It does not matter that a particular state might disclose its voter data to some other requester under some other circumstances.” A statement that seems fairly idiotic to many conservatives.
That’s the entire point the integrity commission is making. The data has already been released to the public, because it was sold by the state for revenue.
Many states have passed laws requiring a photo ID to vote in an attempt to cut down on illegals voting in U.S. elections.
Privacy advocates would be up in arms if the commission was overstepping legal boundaries, but it’s not. The only opposition to the request is originating from liberal states and liberal secretaries.
Judge Collen Kollar-Kotelly, who has been assigned to case, is no friend to conservatives. She has a conflicting record of rulings. She obstructed republican attempts to convict terrorists after the 9/11 attack and just last year she denied an injunction request that would have stopped Cathy Lanier from preventing carry permits requested by law-abiding citizens. However, she was also the judge who rebuked CAIR in the Muslim Mafia trial.
Fortunately, Trump’s commission has recourse the Supreme Court if Kollar-Kotelly decides unfavorably for the commission.
It remains to be seen whether the election integrity omission will be able to do its job. Regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit, a serious investigation into the American election system must take place. As it is now, there are simply too many ways for leftists to manipulate returns.
The hearing on the case is scheduled later this afternoon.

Obama Abruptly Ends Vacay And Shows Up In D.C. The Day Trump Gets Back – Forgets He’s Not Pres Anymore,"Obama has had an extremely difficult time relinquishing the power he was held as president of the Untied States, as he’s spent every waking moment in recent months obsessing on ways to take out President Trump with his “resistance movement.” Over the past week Obama’s jealousy was on full display while Trump was in Germany for the G-20 Summit meeting, where Obama was caught breaking federal law to hold a secret meeting with the South Korean president. Now in an effort to up his game of subversion against President Trump, Obama has just abruptly ended his international vacation to fly back to Washington D.C. for another meeting cloaked in secrecy, proving yet again just how far he’s willing to go in order to get President Trump removed from office.
Obama’s antics over the past week in order to sabotage President Trump have been nothing short of startling. We reported several days ago how Obama secretly met with South Korean President Moon ae-in last week in order to discuss “dealing with Trump” for over 40 minutes, which was a straight up act of illegal subversion on Obama’s part. As Obama was busy parading around and pretending to still be president of the United States, he missed the fact that holding a diplomatic foreign meeting as a civilian is a direct violation of the Logan Act, and a serious federal crime. But unfortunately for President Trump, Obama was just getting warmed up with his plans to get rid of Trump for good.
Obama’s meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in
What’s hilarious is that no matter what Obama and his band of Democratic cronies do to take down Trump, their plans keep imploding in their faces. Scandals surrounding Democrats continue to impede any type of momentum liberals have towards an impeachment on Trump, just take a look at how CNN and MSNBC (the propaganda wing of their “resistance movement”) have been going down in flames in recent weeks.
Democrats are also licking their wounds after their high hopes for getting Trump impeached over the “Russian election conspiracy” was officially killed this weekend, after President Trump discussed the issue with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their closed-door meeting at the G-20 summit. Compound the issue that the Democratic Party has no real prospects to run against Trump in 2020, and it’s easy to see why Obama and liberals are panicking, as all their plans to get rid of Trump are currently going down in flames. After a devastating last month, Obama is now kicking his antics into full gear, where he will be heading a fundraiser in Washington D.C. this week in a desperate attempt to “woo donors” to invest in political races.” The Hill reported:
Former President Barack Obama will headline a fundraiser in Washington, D.C., this week.
He’s set to appear Thursday at a closed-door event for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, the Washington Post reported.
Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez told the Post that Obama wants to help “build the bench” for the Democrats.
TRENDING ON FREEDOM DAILY
NDRC Executive Director, Kelly Ward would not say how much Obama’s appearance is expected to bring in, said he “still has such a microphone” to woo donors to invest in state-level races.
“That bully pulpit still very much rests with him,” Ward told the Post.
Obama wants to support the committee’s “efforts to address unfair gerrymandering practices that leave too many American voters feeling voiceless in the electoral process,” spokesman Kevin Lewis said.
“Restoring fairness to our democracy by advocating for fairer, more inclusive district maps around the country is a priority for President Obama,” he added.
The desperation of the Democratic Party is quite entertaining at this point as all their plans keep imploding in their faces. While it’s legal for Obama to hold fundraisers, what’s not legal is for him to be conspiring with world leaders in a civilian capacity to influence our government behind Trump’s back. Obama better wake up soon and realize that he isn’t President of the United States anymore. His antics in South Korea were a serious federal crime, and it’s time that President Trump puts an end to this nonsense as Obama isn’t showing signs of backing up anytime soon in his pursuits to get Trump removed from office.

"Emmy Nominations For News And Documentaries Are Out, And Guess Who Got SNUBBED?","GooglePinterestDiggLinkedin Reddit Stumbleupon PrintDeliciousPocketTumblr
The nominees are out for the 38th Annual News and Documentary Emmy Awards, and it’s full very worthy outlets who did tons of amazing work throughout 2016. Brainwashed conservatives will probably be very upset with the nominees, though. There are 235 national Emmys this year, and while CNN is up for 16, while NBC is up for 9 and MSNBC is up for 5, Fox News is up for exactly…zero.

Check it out below:
They don’t even appear on the list. Outlets such as HBO (for Vice), Fusion, even the History Channel and the Weather Channel are there. Netflix is up for 6 Emmys for various documentaries. But Fox News is nowhere to be found.
To add insult to injury to the poor conservatives who think Fox News and Breitbart are the only honest media out there, MSBNC’s “Rachel Maddow Show” is up for the “Outstanding News, Discussion and Analysis” category. “All In With Chris Hayes” is also up for that award, receiving two nominations for two different episodes. CBS received a nod for “Outstanding Feature Story in a Newscast” for “Note To Self — Vice President Joe Biden.” Many outlets received nods under several categories for their coverage of ongoing crises in the Middle East and terror attacks in Europe (but not Fox News).
“Fake News” CNN is up for three awards in the “Outstanding Live Interview” category, with Brianna Keilar’s dramatic exchange with one of Trump’s attorneys, Michael Cohen, getting one nod, and Anderson Cooper getting two. Rachel Maddow was also nominated in this category for one of her interviews with Kellyanne Conway. Under “Outstanding Special News,” PBS News got a nod for “Questions for President Obama: A PBS News Special.”
The “Amazon” Washington Post was nominated for “Outstanding Breaking News Coverage” for its coverage of the Pulse Nightclub shooting. “The Failing” New York Times, as Trump repeatedly calls them, has been nominated for “Outstanding Short Documentary” for “4.1 Miles.” “4.1 Miles” is about a Greek Coast Guard captain who found himself suddenly tasked with saving thousands of Syrian refugees crossing the Aegean Sea.
Univision, with whom Trump has publicly feuded, is up for several awards, including “Outstanding Coverage of a Breaking News Story in Spanish.” That nomination is for their coverage of the capture of notorious drug lord El Chapo. Their investigative piece on the Panama Papers got a nod under “Outstanding Investigative Journalism in Spanish.”
ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, and many others have received nods as well, but not Fox News. Gee, we can’t imagine why. View the full list here.

Rika's hatred of tea party politics and the idea that cooperating means colluding with some ""enemy"" is what really prompted her to start writing on liberal politics.

"Fighting back Reliance Jio impact: Bharti Airtel Q1 results surprise, beat analysts estimates","Bharti Airtel on Tuesday surprised the Street with a set of numbers for the June quarter that were well ahead of analysts’ estimates. (Reuters)
Bharti Airtel on Tuesday surprised the Street with a set of numbers for the June quarter that were well ahead of analysts’ estimates. The country’s biggest telco posted a net profit of Rs 367 crore in Q1FY18, down 1.61% sequentially, beating Bloomberg’s consensus estimate of Rs 282 crore. The company, however, saw a big sequential decline of 9.5% in average voice realisations per customer at 21.98 paise. Moreover, realisations from data services dipped a sharp 51.1% sequentially to 5.97 paise per customer. Nevertheless, following new bundled offers from the telco, the usage, both on the voice and data fronts, has jumped. Voice usage per customer saw a 7.7% sequential growth to 507 minutes in the June quarter while data usage per customer jumped 96.2% to 2611 megabytes (MB). Revenues in the June quarter, at Rs 21,958 crore, were marginally up 0.10% sequentially. Ebitda or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation was down 2.13% at Rs 7,823 crore. The Ebitda margin stood at 35.6% compared with 36.4% in the preceding quarter. Bharti’s results in the previous two quarters were disappointing with key metrics hit by the disruption caused by Reliance Jio’s free voice and cheap data services. The telco’s average realisation per user (Arpu) for voice declined 2.5% sequentially to `111 in Q1FY18. The Arpu for data services fell 4% to Rs 156. The company’s mobile revenues declined 0.4% sequentially to Rs 12,914 crore.
Following Jio’s free voice and low data rates, Bharti has also bundled voice and data packs, offering more data at lower rates. Where earlier data rates were Rs 250 per GB, these are now down to Rs 50 per GB and even Rs 10 per GB in certain bundled offers. Acknowledging that the disruption in the market continues, Gopal Vittal, managing director and CEO, India and South Asia, said, “The pricing disruption in the Indian telecom market caused by the entry of a new operator continued with industry revenues declining over 15% year on year, creating further stress on sector profitability, cash flows and leverages. Consequently, our revenues declined 10% and Ebitda margin eroded by 5.3% year-on-year.”
Bharti said that its mobile data revenues decreased 18.8% to Rs 3,765 crore compared with Rs 4,639 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. Mobile data revenues now represent 17.1% of total revenues against 18.2% in the corresponding quarter last year. Though the quarter saw monthly churn increasing to 3.8% from 3.6% in the preceding quarter, it still shows that Bharti is not losing customers despite the challenge from Jio. Its data customer base (3G & 4G) in fact increased by 14.5% sequentially to around 49 million. Bharti is likely to face fresh heat from Jio September onwards when the latter starts deliveries of its 4G, VoLTE feature phones which are virtually for free as subscribers need to pay a refundable security deposit of Rs 1,500 that can be taken back after returning the phone after 36 months.
Base tariff is Rs 153 per month with 0.5 GB data per day while the Rs 309 offer provides 1 GB data for 56 days and the ability to connect the content from phone to television sets via a cable connector. Around three to four hours of daily video can be seen under this plan. Since more than 200 million subscribers fall in this segment, Bharti will face a tough fight from Jio here. Bharti is already in the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal, where it has challenged the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s passive approach towards Jio’s free services, which it contends is not allowed under regulations.",Financial Express,0
‘The president grabbed vaginas!’ CNN panel on Trump’s ogling of woman reporter goes off the rails,"28 Jun 2017 at 12:47 ET
A CNN panel discusses President Trump's Oval Office flirting (Screen cap).
Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story!
Earlier this week, President Donald Trump interrupted his call with Irish Prime Minster Leo Varadkar to ogle female reporter who happened to be in the Oval Office.
“She has a nice smile on her face,” Trump told Varadkar of Irish reporter Caitríona Perry, who was in the Oval Office filming the call. “So I bet she treats you well.”
During a CNN panel on Wednesday, guests debated whether Trump’s flirtation with the reporter was innocent — or whether there was something more sinister involved.
Symone Sanders, the former press secretary for Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign, said she was not surprised by Trump’s behavior since we’ve seen in the past that he objectifies women and makes inappropriate comments about their appearances — even in professional settings.
“This is how Donald Trump always acts when there are women in the room,” she said. “It was condescending, it was just creepy! Why was the President of the United States picking out reporters who just happened to be aesthetically pleasing, and calling them over, and telling them they’ve got a nice smile?”
Nan Hayworth, who serves as a member of Trump’s presidential advisory board, disputed Sanders’ characterization and said that he had “incredible charm.”
“This was just Donald Trump… being the kind of guy who will notice when someone has a lovely smile,” she said. “I don’t think that there’s any harm to it.”
Sanders, however, wouldn’t accept this talking point — and shamed Hayworth for whitewashing Trump’s long history of inappropriate behavior, including the boasts about committing sexual assault that were captured on the infamous Access Hollywood tape.
“Never forget that the president grabbed vaginas, and he talked about it afterward,” Sanders thundered.

July 14, 2017 9:40 AM
 
Marc E. Kasowitz, President Donald Trump’s longtime attorney representing him in the Russia investigations, reportedly sent angry, threatening and profane emails to a random stranger who criticized him this week, cursing at the man and telling him, “I already know where you live, I’m on you.”
Kasowitz, speaking through a spokesman, did not dispute the account, which was reported Thursday by the independent nonprofit journalism site ProPublica. Kasowitz’s spokesman said in a statement to The Washington Post on Thursday night that Kasowitz regretted his words and that the email “came at the end of a very long day that at 10 p.m. was not yet over.”
The exchange began when the unidentified man, described as a retired public relations worker, saw a ProPublica story on MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show” that discussed how Kasowitz had made the unusual decision not to seek a security clearance to handle the Russia case.
After the segment aired Wednesday night, the man sent Kasowitz an email with the subject line, “Resign Now.” According to ProPublica, the message read in part: “I believe it is in your interest and the long-term interest of your firm for you to resign from your position advising the President re. pending federal legal matters. No good can come from this.”
Kasowitz responded with a flurry of messages sent between 9:30 p.m. and 10 p.m. Eastern Time. ProPublica published the thread in full, saying it had confirmed the man’s identity and verified that the emails had come from Kasowitz’s firm.
The exchange comes amid ongoing turmoil within Trump’s legal team, which has struggled to rein in a client notorious for his unfiltered early-morning tweet storms, off-the-cuff speaking style and general lack of verbal restraint.
As the investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election have intensified, Trump has defied his attorneys’ instructions to avoid talking about the matter in his tweets and private conversations with others under scrutiny, including Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, as The Washington Post reported Thursday.

Marc Kasowitz, President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, made a statement following James Comey's hearing. Kasowitz denounced the allegations that Trump interfered with the FBI's investigation into the White House's possible ties to Russia.
Earlier this week, the New York Times reported that Trump’s relationship with Kasowitz, his personal lawyer and head of the legal team, was showing strain and that the president was growing disillusioned by his strategy. Kasowitz, in turn, had become “deeply frustrated” by the president, the Times reported.
After receiving the stranger’s email Wednesday night, Kasowitz wrote a message back saying “f--- you,” then followed up 15 minutes later with a longer response, according to ProPublica.
“How dare you send me an email like that,” he wrote. “I’m on you now. You are f---ing with me now Let’s see who you are Watch your back, bitch.”
“Call me. Don’t be afraid, you piece of s---,” he wrote in another message. “Stand up. If you don’t call, you’re just afraid.”
A later email read: “I already know where you live, I’m on you. You might as well call me. You will see me. I promise. Bro.”
The man sent only one response, thanking Kasowitz for his “kind reply” and saying he may get in touch with him “as appropriate.” He later told ProPublica he was so disturbed by the conversation that he forwarded it to the FBI.
The person sending that email is entitled to his opinion and I should not have responded in that inappropriate manner. I intend to send him an email stating just that. This is one of those times where one wishes he could reverse the clock, but of course I can’t.
Kasowitz, through his spokesman
Kasowitz said through his spokesman Thursday: “The person sending that email is entitled to his opinion and I should not have responded in that inappropriate manner. I intend to send him an email stating just that. This is one of those times where one wishes he could reverse the clock, but of course I can’t.”
In the story that prompted the exchange, ProPublica’s Justin Elliott and Jesse Eisinger reported that Kasowitz did not expect to apply for a security clearance, even though the Russia investigations would involve reviewing classified materials.
Even if Kasowitz applied for a security clearance, ProPublica suggested he will likely have trouble getting one because of personal issues which were disputed by a Kasowitz spokesman as “false and defamatory.” The Post has not independently confirmed ProPublica’s allegations.
Kasowitz’s spokesman told the publication he did not require a security clearance to represent the president.
Trump retained Kasowitz to help him navigate the Russia investigations in May, shortly after former FBI director Robert S. Mueller III was appointed special counsel in charge of the Department of Justice’s probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible collusion by the Trump campaign.
Kasowitz, who has represented Trump in a variety of cases over the years, is known in New York law circles for his aggressive style in and out of the courtroom. In a recent profile, Bloomberg called him a “bare-knuckled litigator” and a “pit bull loyal to the boss.”

Sheriff: Narcan Too Expensive To Save Lives – Highlights Bigger Issue With Police (VIDEO),"America’s heroin epidemic isn’t a new story. In fact it is an old story that is just now getting the attention it deserves.
Prescription companies have been pushing opioid products on the American public for years and years now and the ramifications are finally being addressed.
One of the more positive inventions that have come out of this crisis is a drug called Narcan that can reverse an overdose almost instantly.
Law enforcement, paramedics, and even sometimes members of the public, carry this miracle drug with them in order to help their fellow man, unless you’re in Butler county.
The sheriff of Butler County in Ohio, Richard K. Jones, says that his officers don’t carry Narcan because it is “dangerous” and “sucking the taxpayers dry.”
One dose of Narcan costs $37.50.
The reasoning behind this is twofold: the first being that the paramedics usually arrive at the same time and are “more equipped” to use Narcan, the second being that the people who OD are not happy to see police officers.
Now, ignoring the fact that you have almost died – your body jumps back after being forced into an immediate withdrawal and this is an extremely jarring process – the victims of heroin overdoses obviously do not want to see cops because that means their lives might be ruined.
The American “drug war,” or the war on drug users, views the addicts as the perpetrators of the crime, not victims. This mentality often leads to victims being locked up for many years, receiving now help, becoming vilified, and then falling into the same cycle.
It seems Sheriff Jones has his solution to the problem, reform his own police force to work with the addicts who need help.

With a $15 million paycheck last year, he’s the highest paid person on YouTube, proving that you really can make it doing anything in America.
Recently, however, his channel has moved away from video games to other subjects, among them being politics. Having been the victim of a smear campaign from the left (which you can read about here), his views have naturally drifted right-of-center, which is awesome, considering the size and relative youth of his audience.
In his most recent video he trashes the dishonesty of Piers Morgan – and debunks the oft-cited “gender wage gap.”
But don’t just take his word for it on the gender wage gap. Check out the statistics from the U.S. Department of Labor.
In 2014, a study commissioned by the U.S Dept. of Labor found that, after accounting for some behaviors and choices (such as career choice and how long a person works, which affect wages), the wage gap narrowed to between 5-7%. Even the researchers note that they only examined wages and not worker compensation (wages+benefits). According to the authors, research shows that women prefer a higher percentage of their compensation in non-cash benefits (like health insurance), which the gender wage gap totally ignores. They also state that they did not account for work experience or job tenure. According to them, “a single comprehensive analysis that considers all of the factors simultaneously; however, such an analysis is not feasible to conduct with available data bases”
Ultimately, their conclusions is that: “This study leads to the unambiguous conclusion that the differences in the compensation of men and women are the result of a multitude of factors and that the raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to justify corrective action. Indeed, there may be nothing to correct. The differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers.”
Shouldn’t that put the debate to rest? Yes! But when victimhood is currency in politics today, the myth will persist for decades to come.

CNN Should be Called Trump News Network (TNN),"Written by Gary Fouse
CNN should change its name to the Trump News Network (TNN) since President Trump is the only thing they talk about these days. The “Most Trusted Name in News” is now on a level plane with MSNBC when it comes to bashing Trump. The latest flap is the now famous video Trump put out imposing the CNN logo on the head of Vince McMahon, whom Trump did a wrestling skit with in his pre-White House days. CNN (unlike most of the country) is not laughing about the video. They feel like Trump is now encouraging violence against reporters.
This, of course, is the same network that had comedienne Kathy Griffin co-hosting the CNN New Years Eve festivities with all her raunchiness including a simulation of her giving oral sex to Anderson Cooper on air. That was all fine and dandy. Then (to their credit) CNN canned her after her photo holding a “severed” Trump head a’la ISIS. It was free speech to be sure, but CNN was correct to get rid of her.
I would be the first to concede that Trump’s own CNN video was hardly presidential. While I wish he would act more presidential and just get on with his agenda, I am reconciled to the fact that we will not have a “presidential” president in Trump. This is what it is. I am more concerned with his policies. Of course, the snowflakes at CNN are trying to pump this up into something that might lead to Trump’s impeachment or removal from office under some other pretext, such as the President’s “unbalanced behavior”. That’s not going to happen any more than that “Russian collusion” charge is going to result in anything. CNN will have to find some other straw to grasp at. Perhaps the White House not televising press briefings? Not hardly.
So what is CNN to do? Clearly, Wolf Blitzer and company have a situation on their hands, to use Wolfie’s own phrase. They just have no answer for Trump and his unpredictable behavior. I suggest they start covering him with a more balanced approach. Give him credit when he dies something good. Start talking a little bit about all the other things being investigated that pertain to the Clinton campaign and its collusion with the DNC. I know. I won’t be holding my breath.
But if CNN wants to look for unbalanced behavior, it need look no further than former New Years Eve co-host Griffin’s performance after her firing. Or how about White House correspondent Jim Acosta’s shouting hysterically about the lack of TV cameras in the press briefing? How about Van Jones and his “white backlash” comment on election eve? How about Jones’ comment to a Project Veritas undercover reporter that the Russian collusion deal was a “nothing burger”? How about that producer telling a PV undercover reporter that the American voters are, “stupid as sh–“?

JUST IN: Trump Issues False Statement About Supreme Court Travel Ban Ruling,"Caleb R. Newton-June 26, 2017
On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled on the Trump Administration’s appeal of a lower court’s upending of the infamous Muslim targeting travel ban. The court ruled that certain parts of the ban were allowed to go into effect in the time before the court officially hears the case for and against the travel ban as a whole later this year.
President Trump has now issued a statement praising that ruling — but the ruling contains possible fake news.
Under the Supreme Court’s ruling, travelers from the countries targeted by the ban, including Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen must prove that they have a “bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.” The most recent incarnation of the travel ban outlawed the travel of any individuals at all from the countries in question, while the first version of the travel ban did the same, simply adding Iraq to the list of banned countries.
President Trump’s statement about the Supreme Court’s decision lauds what he calls a unanimous ruling, but as The Hill notes, there is no indication that the ruling was, in fact, unanimous. The unsigned opinion presented on behalf of the entire court did not require justices to reveal their individual opinions.
Nevertheless, Trump acted as though they had revealed their individual opinions, and they were all in favor.
Trump statement says, in part:
‘Today’s unanimous Supreme Court decision is a clear victory for our national security… Today’s ruling allows me to use an important tool to for protecting our Nation’s homeland. I am also particularly gratified that the Supreme Court’s decision was 9-0.’
Read Trump’s full statement below, via White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer:
Statement from @POTUS on Today's Unanimous Supreme Court Decision. pic.twitter.com/0TuHoRJzuT
— Sean Spicer (@PressSec) June 26, 2017
It is entirely possible that President Trump simply does not know how unsigned rulings work. Such, of course, is yet another example of the dangerous level of incompetence currently vested in the office of this nation’s Chief Executive.
The administration has at least three justices definitely in their favor, with Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch having signed an opinion stating that they want the full travel ban allowed to go into effect.
There remains no evidence that the travel ban is as necessary for national security as the Trump Administration claims. No individual from the targeted countries has committed a terror attack in the United States at any point in recent history.
Twitter obviously had a lot to say about this.

Lewis Hamilton silences critics — again,"Silverstone (United Kingdom) – Booed and disparaged before the race, unconventional Lewis Hamilton silenced his critics and re-booted his bid for a fourth world title with a record-equalling fifth British Grand Prix victory.
The three-times world champion claimed his 67th pole position and his 57th grand prix victory on Sunday to move within a point of championship leader Sebastian Vettel, seventh in his Ferrari after a late puncture.
But prior to the triumph, Hamilton was under a cloud after failing to show up for a pre-race promotional event in London, where his name was booed by fans and negative media coverage dominated the Mercedes driver’s grand prix build-up.
Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff, who had been dismayed by the negative reaction to Hamilton’s decision to take a two-day break on the Greek island Mykonos rather than turn up to promote his sport, attempted to deflect the criticism.
“I think that sometimes he just needs the right impulse to extract maximum performance,” said Wolff.”I think maybe that is an answer to the critics. “I still don’t understand why the British hero is being beaten up before the Grand Prix.It probably made him even more determined to show his fans how he can drive.And how he can drive…”
Few would argue that Hamilton is not the most uniquely talented driver in the current field with a rare gift for speed in all conditions, but many prefer to point at his unconventional, by Formula One standards, lifestyle decisions.

You Wanted a War? You’ve Got a War.,"Back in 2009, media bias was hot on all of the right’s lips. We were aghast that racism accusations were hurled at every criticism of the administration. We were appalled at how many people we believed were good upstanding citizens were having their names dragged through the mud.
For a while, it felt as though one couldn’t oppose the president without the full awareness that their life might be destroyed by a media intent on squashing any and all dissent.
So if one was active at that time, they could be forgiven for defaulting to that setting today. On the news that the wildly inappropriate “Trump vs CNN” gif that President Trump tweeted might be from a middle-aged anonymous Reddit troll, the same folks from back in the Tea Party heyday stepped forward to gallantly defend his right to anonymity against a witch hunt.
The problem is that a lot has happened since the days of handing out pocket constitutions and the sense of optimism that some hoped to engender through calls for a return to founding principles.
Namely, the “right” has become a fairly decent caricature of exactly what all those old biased reports claimed they were: Bitter, stubborn, intellectually dishonest, outrage-mongers, dancing to whatever tune is played by the rationalizing pundit-class of entertainment-driven hacks that masquerade as thinkers.
I spend most of my time firing off my indignation at “our” side of the aisle for a simple reason: we (if we are a we) deserve it. The “right”, from which I have been outcast for the last two years, has spent most of the Trump era rationalizing every bad behavior, forgetting about those thing that used to upset them, switching their policy desires to match their madman of a leader or the thirst of a frenetic “movement”, and generally being a collection of childish rabble reveling in the destruction of all standards in favor of “war.”
Nikki Haley Puts China On Notice In the UN (VIDEO)
“War,” you may recall, was something that (mostly) started with Andrew Breitbart and his principled stand against the media’s unending coordinated assault on the slightest opposition to Barack Obama, and indeed their decades of willful political support of the left. “War” was the acknowledgement and encapsulation of the idea that he intended to run straight into the oncoming fire, calling out all the B.S. he saw as he charged on with no concern about what the elitists thought of him.
He declared war on what he called the Democrat Media Complex. It was welcome.
For the time in which he lived, this was a reasonable and balanced reaction to a media that has since, in some quarters, admitted they were collectively far too soft on Obama and too ready to cast any opposition as racist or evil.
But times they are a-changing.
By the end of 2016, I, along with a lot of the others who didn’t stand in lock step with the Republican Party over the principles that had brought us there, had had our addresses published online, our personal financial records and private information shared to a rabid frothing base of pitchfork-wielding maniacs who were anxious to snuff out and destroy the “traitors.”
At the time (somewhere around the nomination) this sort of behavior was still decried by the conservative movement at large. A great many conservative pundits still hedged their commentary on Trump with comments like “well, I don’t approve of this” or “this is not what the Republican Party or the conservative movement should be applauding.”
Back then, less than a year ago mind you, the kind of conservatives you’d run into on twitter more or less ran with the idea that “this is the nominee for better or worse, he’ll probably lose to Hillary but let’s just try to do the best we can with what we’ve got.”
But then he won.
Apparently there is nothing quite like the intoxication of winning. Because that same class of conservative who remained appalled at the alt-right army of trolls, much less Trump’s behavior, shifted pretty quickly to applauding every single thing Trump did, excusing or ignoring the bad behavior of his die-hard fans, and throwing “what about” out as much as possible to cover up their own inconsistencies.
Whereas just a few years ago, a silly video of Obama taking a selfie was blasted as unpresidential, today, a video of Trump beating the crap out of CNN is a brilliant move. “We’re finally fighting back!”
Fighting back stopped being about conservatism. Stopped being about advancing a true alternative to Obamacare, or even being against progressive taxes and government entitlements. Now fighting back just meant being a dick. Trump has over and over proven himself to not simply have the following of shitposters. He IS a shitposter. The king of them one might argue.
And writers and talking heads from across the media landscape that were once upset the tarnishing of the Office, are now excitedly tweeting about how refreshing it is. Because they just want blood.
This is what makes the rending of garments over the outing of the gif creator so particularly amusing to me. After regularly referring to CNN as ISIS. After constantly rationalizing ANYTHING that Trump does as merely a salvo in the “war” that they believe is a justified and moral war, these “soldiers” are crying into their hands about the death of democracy because CNN treated one shitposter with more restraint than the President treats just about anything.
They excuse the behavior over and over on the part of the president, they ignored the doxing of me and others with mild gestures of “oh that’s too bad,” but now… now it’s gone too far? Now. Because of a vile troll named “HanAssholeSolo”?? Really?
I don’t particularly find the identity of a gif creator to be that newsworthy apart from confirming it wasn’t made by the president or his staff. And I’m not big on the moral relativism required for me to approve of this doxing while lamenting my own.
But to the talking heads and radio personalities that have spent today saying CNN went too far? Spare me. You begged for this. And now you’ve got it.",RedState,1
Trump: 'We'll let Obamacare fail',"Washington (CNN)The collapse of the Republican bid to repeal and replace Obamacare Monday, alongside chaos brewed by the Russia scandal, has revealed a stunted presidency and a White House struggling to master the levers of power.
It also leaves President Donald Trump without a significant legislative triumph to show for his first six months in office.
""He was playing with a firetruck and trying on a cowboy hat as the bill was collapsing and he had no clue,"" a top Republican told CNN's Jeff Zeleny on Tuesday, mocking the ""Made In America"" week at the White House.
Trump was prepared to shoulder no blame for the failure of the bill on Tuesday, and warned he would now simply let Obamacare fail.
""We're not going to own it. I'm not going to own it. I can tell you the Republicans are not going to own it. We'll let Obamacare fail and then the Democrats are going to come to us,"" Trump told reporters at the White House.
So far however, there is no sign that the Democrats would take part in any effort that would effectively repeal Obamacare. And it seems just as likely that a crisis in the health care industry, involving Americans losing health insurance, would come back to hurt the party in power, in Congress and the White House -- Republicans.
Combined with Trump's historically low approval rating for a President at this stage of his first term, and the constant, corrosive presence of the Russia drama, it adds up to a presidency testing the limits of political viability.
Latest health care bill collapses following Moran, Lee defections
""When a President has the lowest approval ratings of any President after six months it's not surprising he took one of the biggest body blows in politics after six months,"" said David Gergen, a senior CNN political analyst.
""We have never seen a President put forward a major legislative piece in his early days that was greeted with such derision and such fear,"" Gergen told CNN's Don Lemon on Monday night.
The question now is whether the White House and Republicans in Congress can find a way to marshall the GOP monopoly on power towards another significant agenda item -- tax reform for instance.
Fact check: Has Trump signed the most bills?
Fact check: Has Trump signed the most bills? 01:28
If Trump is to be more successful in future legislative fights, it may require big changes in his style.
Perhaps the the ultimate takeaway from this legislative disaster is that Trump's own political methodology -- that was wildly successful in getting him elected, has turned out to be an insufficient base on which to build a functioning presidency.
The health care effort revealed a White House that was unskilled in dealing with Congress and in some cases unaware to the political pressures faced by Trump's GOP allies on Capitol Hill. When the bill was speeding towards extinction on Monday, Trump was apparently oblivious to the impending embarrassment.
On Monday afternoon, he blithely asserted that all was well, apparently unaware that the bill was already all but doomed.
""We're getting it together and it's going to happen,"" he said during his afternoon event on US manufacturing, where he spent time admiring products including jumping into a fire truck and donning a Stetson hat.
He also spent hours this weekend -- when the bill's chances of passing were expiring -- at the US Women's Golf Open, at his Bedminister, New Jersey, course, waving to fans and watching the action.
That behavior was in keeping with the hands off attitude that Trump adopted during the Senate's Obamacare repeal efforts. But it also raises questions about his political approach itself.
In recent days, Trump adopted big brush themes, maintained his superficial acquaintance with policy, used of social media as a messaging tool, and refused to accept any of the conventions about how politics has been conducted for eons -- i.e. how bills have been passed.
He promised vengeance if Republicans did not pass the bill -- but little incentive for doubtful senators to get behind him, perhaps not the most effective strategy for a President with low approval ratings.
Explore Trump's progress on key campaign promises
""I don't even want to talk about it because I think it would be very bad,"" Trump said in an interview last week with Christian Broadcasting Network. ""I will be very angry about it and a lot of people will be very upset.
And yet, a pair of conservative senators, Mike Lee of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas, broke the news of their opposition -- sinking the bill -- while Trump was dining with other GOP senators to discuss the legislation.
""It was beyond rude,"" a Republican senator who asked to speak without attribution to talk candidly about the feeling inside the caucus told CNN's Dana Bash of Lee and Moran's move.
Yet this senator also noted how illustrative it is about the level of respect for this President among many Republicans on the hill.
""It just shows what our guys think of Trump. Can you imagine them doing this to another president?"" the senator said.
Trump's reaction to defeat
How the Republican health care bill fell apart
The President's public comments before and after the humiliating defeat was typical of his engagement during the process, showing an incomplete understanding of the political dynamics, a tendency to apportion blame to others and a lack of specifics about how the legislation could be saved or improved beyond unspecific platitudes.
Then, after disaster struck, he tweeted, calling for a simple vote to repeal Obamacare -- and work on a replacement plan from a clean slate.
But it's unclear whether that is a workable legislative solution in the Senate, or a political one for the GOP since it would be easy to opponents to frame the bill as slashing health care for millions of people without offering them any immediate replacement.
""We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans. Most Republicans were loyal, terrific & worked really hard. We will return!"" Trump tweeted on Tuesday morning.
But a rebound will depend on getting a significant piece of legislation passed -- to show this White House and this Congress can get it done despite the obstacles that thwarted the health care push.
The immediate impact of the Obamacare repeal failure will be to further overshadow the victories Trump has secured.
He managed to install a new Supreme Court justice, Neil Gorsuch, who was widely praised by conservatives and will carry forward his legacy for decades to come.
The liberation of the Iraqi city of Mosul, with US help, and the recent strides against ISIS in Syria, have not got the attention they might deserve, and the White House can post to some decent economic data -- though Democrats would say both those trends were set in place by the Obama White House.
Quietly, the administration has also been working to dismantle Obama era regulations in the environment, education and financial spheres.
White House strategy -- or lack thereof
But one problem of the Obamacare repeal process was that it was never completely clear what the White House strategy was, other than just waiting pen-in-hand in the Oval Office for a bill to sign.
One approach to a successful reform effort would have been to try to mobilize the nation behind the President through visits outside his political comfort zone in areas where he has strong support, and to build momentum for the bill with televised presidential addresses.
He chose not to take the path -- possibly because the bill was seen by so many people as an unworkable solution to the problems with Obamacare.
The White House put at least a show of presidential zeal over the weekend, revealing that Trump called senators, as he had done on the way home from his trip to Paris last week.
But Trump's Twitter account also shows that in the last few days, the President was far more interested in other issues -- including the spectacle of of his trip to France's Bastille Day parade and the fallout from his son Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting with a Russian lawyer.
As I have always said, let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!

"Today, YouTube has become truly Indic: Head of Entertainment Content, Satya Raghavan","YouTube is an ad-funded platform. We have a revenue-sharing model and 55% of what we earn, we share it back with the creator.
YouTube, which has been in India for over a decade, saw an upsurge in content from the country only a couple of years back. Seen as the best video-sharing platform by creators to voice their thoughts and build a community, YouTube India hopes to help its partners expand their businesses. Satya Raghavan talks to Brandwagon’s Meghna Sharma on the recent developments in the Indian market and emerging trends. Edited excerpts:
Let’s start with YouTube India’s journey. What significant patterns have you seen emerge in the last decade?
In India, up to 2014, most of the content found on YouTube belonged largely to the traditional media — TV, movies or sports. But an interesting tipping point happened around the 2014 general elections when suddenly many people, who were on the platform, found a voice. At the tip of this was comedy. Creators like AIB, TVF and others, essentially out of Mumbai and Delhi, started voicing their thoughts, probably echoing what the country was thinking at that point of time. The other set of creators who were active at that time were food creators; housewives to chefs were sharing recipe-based videos. We were also seeing the early signs of musicians. So, throughout 2014 we saw the explosion of personal creators using Hinglish with values and thoughts which were very metro-centric. We saw the same phenomenon happening in 2015 in southern languages.
Today, we have a very interesting and robust ecosystem where we can see traditional media doing more unique things. For instance, earlier when a movie would release, the production house would put out five to six videos; now, they put out almost 50-100 videos during the promotion period, because there is an amazing correlation between this and ultimate box office results. I can say that today YouTube has become truly Indic in nature. This year can also be called as ‘return of Hindi’ but with very different sensibilities. It is not metro, but more rustic.
How do you foresee the growth potential for YouTube Go and YouTube Kids in India?
We have realised that since our user base has expanded, there is a great opportunity in tailor-made services for large segments. Kids’ creators, for instance, are a very large segment. We all know that children today are watching technology at an earlier age so we wanted to deliver a customised service. That’s how YouTube Kids began. It also offers a lot of controls to help parents monitor. It did very well for us when we launched it a couple of years ago abroad and got it to India last year; it has become a sizeable part of our portfolio. Elsewhere in the world, we also launched gaming and music apps at the same time but we haven’t yet launched them in India.
We went consumer-centric here. We have 100-200 million new consumers who are consuming videos differently. They are the data-conscious lot; so we wanted to give them an app which is fundamentally built for a great data management experience. The concept of offline was launched for the Indian market and then, we launched it in 85 other countries. We have a pilot for YouTube Go in a few Indian cities and will soon have a national launch.
In a highly competitive and digital world, how can one effectively monetise digital content?
YouTube is an ad-funded platform; therefore, advertising is at the very core of it. We have a revenue-sharing model and 55% of what we earn, we share it back with the creator. What we have also realised is that content today, whether it comes from India or any other part of the world, is consumed elsewhere too. So now our creators are conscious about what they are earning from India and what they are earning from abroad. In some countries, we also have a subscription product called YouTube Red. So when content is consumed by a consumer of YouTube Red, creators have access to subscription earnings too. So, how it works for a creator is that content is the base on which they can later put multiple layers. And as the creator grows, we have seen brands get interested in associating with them.
After the controversy wherein a number of brands (Marks & Spencer, HSBC) withdrew advertising from YouTube following revelations that their ads appeared next to extremist videos, what steps did the platform take to ensure that monetisation isn’t impacted?
Google had shared its views after this incident. All I can add is that today, advertisers have a lot more control over what kind of content their ads can be seen on.
How are creators in India different from their Western counterparts?
Right now the creator ecosystem is balanced; we have a good mix of traditional media content and YouTube-first content. Even within the latter, there are many verticals which have emerged. Some interesting verticals have deepened to give birth to sub-verticals. For example, we have a vertical called women’s lifestyle, which was, until a couple of years back, about beauty products and DIY creators, but today we have creators who are talking about style and fashion, nutrition, travel, etc. All of this is very appealing to the women consumer. Similarly, we had a vertical called technology which has now merged into men’s lifestyle. So apart from gadgets, we see sub-verticals like motoring and gaming emerging in markets like Japan, the US, etc. It is here one can see inter-country differences.
One can now watch a movie on YouTube for a certain price. How has the response been especially with so many OTT and VoD services now present in India?
We have two pay models — one where you subscribe to have an ad-free experience and second, where you can watch a single movie. So consumption happens on YouTube but Google Play is at the forefront. With the advent of other OTT players, we are seeing that it is helping in expanding the market. It is a wonderful time for consumers and creators. A lot of our creators are doing great work for other players as well.",Financial Express,0
IT’S OFFICIAL: John McCain is Going to JAIL TODAY!,"June 27, 2017 by Thomas Rhett
John McCain simply got the most exceedingly bad news of his life, people! A WikiLeaks archive has recently surfaced that uncovered the US Senator huge way! As indicated by the most recent reports John McCain is authoritatively a CRIMINAL TRAITOR!
On the off chance that you don’t recall, John McCain was in charge of the fake Russia dossier guaranteeing that Trump had binds to Russian whores. And furthermore guaranteed that conceivable Russian hacking into John Podesta’s email was a “Demonstration OF WAR.”
Be that as it may, a 2008 WikiLeaks record has quite recently released uncovering McCain as criminal double crosser as he seems to be! The hole demonstrates that in 2008, McCain was approaching the Russians for illicit gifts to his battle. At that point Russia uncovered the accompanying proclamation:
“WE [RUSSIA] HAVE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN REQUESTING FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION TO HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.”
It is ILLEGAL for U.S. possibility to request remote cash.
What boldness does it take to bash Trump over FALSE associations with Russia, however he approached them for battle cash?!
Here’s Russian’s refusal, per Subject Politics:
“IN THIS CONNECTION WE WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE THAT RUSSIAN OFFICIALS, THE PERMANENT MISSION OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION TO THE UNITED NATIONS OR THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT DO NOT FINANCE POLITICAL ACTIVITY IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.”",Proud Leader,1
Fixing a toxic culture like Uber's requires more than just a new CEO,"In times of organizational crisis, some companies are able to right the ship, while others sink under the pressure.
Recently, Uber has been under fire for a bad corporate culture, which promoted, among other things, sexism and other forms of toxic behavior. This led to a four-month investigation and pressure from the board for founder and CEO Travis Kalanick to take an indefinite leave of absence. He suddenly resigned as CEO on June 20 after several major investors demanded he step down.
Unfortunately, Uber is not the only company to come under public scrutiny in recent months for its toxic culture. Fox News and Sterling Jewelers have also been accused of widespread sexual harassment. And other companies, such as Volkswagen and Wells Fargo, have been in the media spotlight for unethical behavior.
Many have focused on the role of leaders in allowing toxic cultures to fester, which is what led to the ousting of Fox founder Roger Ailes and Kalanick’s departure. While this is certainly a necessary step, it’s not enough.
Our research shows that companies need also to root out a bad leader’s followers among the rank and file and make other important internal changes. Otherwise, a moral meltdown like Uber’s is likely to happen again.

Harassment in the workplace
Sexual harassment is a widespread problem in U.S. workplaces, and its effects are pervasive and corrosive.
It is estimated that 58 percent of women in the U.S. have encountered potentially harassing behaviors at work, while 24 percent have experienced sexual harassment.
Victims tend to suffer in many ways, including through lower job satisfaction, damaged physical and mental health and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Employees who witness sexual harassment at work are likely to experience the same negative outcomes.
Harassment is more likely to occur in organizations in which managers have a lot of unchecked power over lower-level employees, as seems to be the case at Uber and Fox, with their powerful and charismatic founders.
Importantly, these toxic behaviors do not start and stop with those at the top. They may become embedded in the organization’s underlying culture, which begs the question: Once a toxic culture takes hold, what can a company do to reverse it?
Our work on toxic leadership demonstrates how toxic, unethical, flawed or otherwise ineffective leaders can do a lot of damage in organizations.
But the damage can also run both ways. Susceptible followers, a lack of checks and balances and other cultural elements can help create or reinforce bad leadership.
Thus, while it is easy to fire leaders when a culture becomes toxic, there are many other factors that must be addressed for true organizational transformation to occur. Our research suggests some best practices for addressing these factors and reversing a culture gone wrong.
With respect to followers, there are certain types of individuals who are likely to remain obedient to toxic leaders, turn a blind eye to their behavior and even participate in the leader’s destructive activities.
Based on established theory and research across a wide range of scientific disciplines, our recent work proposes five types of followers who are particularly susceptible to the influence of toxic leaders.
We break these groups into two overarching categories: “conformers” (individuals who are prone to obedience) and “colluders” (those who actively align themselves with toxic leaders).
In terms of conformers, “lost souls” are insecure individuals who lack a clear sense of self and who find a sense of identity, purpose and belonging through their affiliation with strong, powerful leaders and their groups. “Authoritarians” are those who rigidly adhere to social hierarchies and tend to simply follow orders, whether ethical or unethical, from senior leaders.
Finally, “bystanders” are fearful individuals who remain silent and turn a blind eye to a leader’s toxic behavior to prevent any negative consequences to themselves.
In terms of colluders, “opportunists” are those who ingratiate themselves with toxic leaders for personal gain, while “acolytes” share the same values, beliefs and goals as the leader.

What to do with followers
Importantly, when toxic leaders are replaced, these followers remain. How should organizations deal with each of these follower types?
First, in terms of colluders, it should be obvious that acolytes and opportunists need to be rooted out and let go. Opportunists are sure to put their own self-interests ahead of any ethical concerns and the greater good of the organization, while acolytes are likely to possess the very same values and beliefs that got their leaders into trouble to begin with.
For example, at Uber, those managers who were identified as active promoters of the culture of harassment that was passed down from the top should be let go. For the same reason, ex-Fox host Bill O'Reilly had to be fired, given the many sexual harassment allegations against him.
But companies obviously can’t fire everyone. And so with conformers, employees who are lost souls or authoritarians are at greater risk of blind obedience to those in power – and being co-opted by another bad manager, thereby making it harder to fix the culture. As such, targeted interventions that seek to retrain these individuals must be a primary goal. Because cultures are sticky, these followers will need to be taught to behave in ways consistent with the new culture.
In particular, it is important that they understand the importance of constructively challenging and holding leaders accountable and that these behaviors are rewarded and expected within the new culture. At Uber, employees who were closely aligned with the staffers it fired after the investigation will need retraining to learn the company’s new value structure.
Finally, bystanders need to be empowered to act when they observe malfeasance, given their fears and natural tendency to turn a blind eye to toxic behavior. This means creating clear, nonpunitive methods for reporting bad behavior and training individuals on all issues surrounding effective whistle-blowing. Fox News, for example, had an anonymous hotline for reporting abuse, but few employees felt comfortable using it. The company will need to empower employees like Gretchen Carlson – the first to publicly raise the issue of sexual harassment.

The road to redemption
Overall, the road to redemption after a scandal or crisis is long and hard. But this may be because most companies think that simply firing the old leader(s) will address the issue. Dealing with their followers throughout the organization is also essential, as is reasserting checks and balances by strengthening board independence.
Past CEOs, such as Alan Mulally of Ford, have demonstrated that you can fix a broken culture. Essential to his success was that he spent a lot of time aligning employees with the automaker’s new values.
We, as the general public, are also important in holding companies accountable. The actions taken in the aftermath of the Uber allegations, for example, may not have occurred if the public shrugged its proverbial shoulders instead of deleting the app from their phones.
So although toxic companies need to do the bulk of the legwork in terms of regulating themselves, we can all play a role in driving more inclusive workplaces worldwide.

"Crazy Chelsea Hits an ALL TIME LOW, Plagiarises “Her” New Book","July 12, 2017 Joe
Calling Chelsea “Crazy” might be an understatement, if she thought she could get away with this.
Chelsea Clinton is now under fire, after being slapped with a lawsuit from a fellow feminist and author. Clinton allegedly stole his idea to write a feminist children’s book.
Clinton’s new book “She Persisted,” appears to be a complete knock off, and it’s likely she’ll have to pay damages and royalties!
“Christopher Janes Kimberley, 56, is suing both the former first daughter and Penguin Random House publisher, accusing them of copyright infringement.
According to court documents lodged in New York and obtained by MailOnline, the author is demanding $150,000 in damages as well as profits from Clinton’s new feminist children’s book which is currently number one in the New York Times best-selling children’s books chart.
Kimberley claims he first came up with a book for young girls about important women in American history. He wrote a book for children of all ages called “A Heart is the Part That Makes Boys And Girls Smart” in 2013.
It contained 15 stories and quotes from women such as Helen Keller, Harriet Tubman and Nellie Bly in a section titled “Quotable Questionnaire”.
Clinton’s book, meanwhile, was published on May 30 this year, recommended for kids aged four to eight, and has 13 stories and quotes about historical women – including the same three women as in Kimberley’s book.
The author said he sent his book proposal to Penguin Random House, Clinton’s book publisher, but never received a reply. He alleges that the president of the publishing house, Jennifer Loja, received his submission and gave it to Clinton.
Kimberley claims Clinton’s book violates his copyright as it includes the same quotes and stories about the three women as in his book.
In April, after learning about Clinton’s new book, the author sent a cease and desist letter to the former first daughter and the publisher. Despite the letter, Clinton continued her book tour.
“A Heart is the Part That Makes Boys And Girls Smart” has been available “free to the public” since 2014 for educational purposes.”

REVEALED: NYPD officer’s killer has DISTURBING history,"NYPD Officer Miosotis Familia was fatally shot shortly after midnight Wednesday while sitting in her marked patrol vehicle. Familia, a mother of three, was transported to St. Barnabas Hospital, where NYPD officials later confirmed she died of her wounds.
As NYPD officers mourned the death of their colleague, new details have begun to emerge about the attacker. In what police officials have called an “unprovoked attack on cops,” Alexander Bonds opened fire on the officers with a revolver. Shockingly, this wasn’t the first time Bonds had attacked police officers.
Inauguration Day ""Antifa"" rioters finally get EXACTLY what they deserveNew poll reveals MAJOR opinion shift on TrumpREVEALED: NYPD officer's killer has DISTURBING history
Bonds served about seven years in prison for a robbery in Syracuse and was paroled in May 2013, records show. Police sources initially said he had been arrested in 2013.
Wednesday was not Bonds’ first attack on a police officer. Sources told the NY Daily News he previously assaulted an officer with brass knuckles.
Before carrying out the attack, Bonds lashed out at police:
Bonds also recently spoke critically of law enforcement on social media, the Daily News reports, noting he seemed to have had up to six different aliases.
After the shooting, Bonds fled the scene, but was later fatally wounded in a shootout with police:
Bonds was gunned down by responding officials about a block from the shooting, police said. A revolver was found at the scene.
Familia was a 12 year NYPD veteran. In addition to her years in law enforcement, Familia previously served her community as a nurse with the Red Cross. She was a graduate of John Jay College of Criminal Justice, and previously attended Ohio State University’s School of Medicine. Tragically, she leaves behind 3 children.
Her black life didn’t matter to her killer…because she was wearing blue.

WATCH: Bats on ‘The View’ Have COMPLETE MELTDOWN After Dem’s Latest Loss,"Democrats suffered a humiliating setback on Tuesday night when Jon Ossoff lost to Karen Handel in a Georgia special election that ended up being the most expensive one of all time. Afterwards, Whoopi Goldberg and her fellow hosts of The View were so upset that they went into complete denial and refused to accept Ossoff’s defeat as a colossal defeat for the entire Democratic Party.
“You can say it’s a loss; I don’t see it that way,” Whoopi said, even though that’s exactly what it is. “I see that Democrats are coming out. And they’re not coming out in perhaps the numbers you want them to come out in. … I’m saying I’m not looking at this as a loss. I’m looking at it as slow progress.”
The Blaze reported that Whoopi’s co-hosts tried to explain that the Democrats’ faulty message might be the reason they keep losing, but the comedian wouldn’t accept this either. Instead, Whoopi pressed on with her incoherent diatribe to try and explain what the Democrats’ message is.
“Look I don’t think there’s anything wrong with the message,” Whoopi said. “I think what’s happening is that people need to make decisions. You know, you feel like you don’t want to see any more gay people I’m sorry, gay people are here. They’re staying.”
“You want people to understand how you feel about your God, well I know how you feel about your God,” she added. “That’s great, but you can’t force me to feel about your God how you feel about your God. There are a lot of specifics that people, that people, don’t want to hear anymore. They don’t want to see a lot of changes, people are tired of change, but this is America, this is what we do!”
It’s pathetic that Whoopi and her friends are in such denial that they can’t even admit when they lose these days. Furthermore, the Democrats have no message, no plan to offer to the American people and yet don’t understand why they lost. This epitomizes the ridiculous liberal mentality that has spread throughout this country, and it’s one of the many reasons why Americans voted for Donald Trump this last election.

New-home sales improved modestly in June,"This Thursday, June 8, 2017, photo shows a new home under construction, in Miami Springs, Fla. On Wednesday, July 26, 2017, the Commerce Department reports on sales of new homes in June. (AP Photo/Alan Diaz)
 
WASHINGTON — U.S. sales of new homes perked up slightly in June, a sign that more would-be buyers are seeking newly built properties.
The Commerce Department said Wednesday that new-home sales edged up 0.8 per cent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 610,000. Sales have registered a healthy 10.9 per cent increase so far this year.
The gains come amid a broader shortage of homes listed for sale, likely pushing more buyers into new construction. Despite steady growth since the housing bubble began to burst a decade ago, sales of new homes remain below historic averages. Builders are contending with a lack of land for construction, a shortage of workers and rising costs for some materials.
“When taking into account the size of the U.S., new home sales are still about 30 per cent below the 50-year average,” said Ralph McLaughlin, chief economist at the real estate firm Trulia. “But the signs for home builders are clear: if you build, they will come.”
Sales last month advanced in the Midwest and West, but purchases were unchanged in the Northeast and dropped in the South.
The June sales report indicates that the price and supply pressures will continue.
The median sales price of a new home fell 3.3 per cent to $310,800. But the median obscures the overall trend of new construction toward more expensive homes. Just 13 per cent of new homes sold last month cost less than $200,000, compared to the 17 per cent for all of 2016 and 19 per cent for 2015.
There have been sales gains in the price range of $200,000 and $299,000 that overlaps with the median price for existing homes. But new homes that cost more than $500,000 are also a growing share of sales.
There were 272,000 new homes on the market in June, the most since June 2009.
But that accounts for only 5.4 months’ supply based on the current sales rate. The gain in new-home inventory has been insufficient to offset the declines in sales listings of existing homes.
The National Association of Realtors said this week that there were 1.96 million existing homes for sale in June, a 7.1 decline from a year ago.",National Post,0

HERE WE GO AGAIN. Liberals Plan Nationwide Protest Against NRA and Dana Loesch,"Unsurprisingly, the perpetually-outraged leftists are outraged yet again. This time, their “nationwide” protest centers on the NRA and Dana Loesch.
If the left is supposed to be the authority on Alinsky tactics, this falls so far short that it’s almost the “What not to do” appendix to Rules for Radicals. Not only are their own people not excited about this yawn-fest, but the rest of America could care less.
Tamika Mallory, co-founder of the Women’s March Inc., will lead a nationwide protest Friday against the National Rifle Association, citing their recent promotional video featuring TheBlaze’s Dana Loesch as a primary reason for their actions.
The protest will take place outside the NRA Headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia, in opposition to a video that they called “dangerous propaganda.”
“You are responsible for an organization that claims to be the ‘oldest civil rights organization in America,’” Mallory wrote in an open letter to the NRA. “However, recent actions by the NRA demonstrate not only a complete disregard for the lives of black and brown people in America – your fellow citizens – but appear to be a direct endorsement of violence against these citizens exercising their constitutional right to protest.,”
As TheBlaze reported last week, Mallory called on the NRA to take several specific actions to show remorse for their video, the first of which was to take down the video, featuring Loesch, who is also a national NRA spokeswoman.
“Immediately remove the recent irresponsible and dangerous propaganda videos narrated by conservative talk radio host Dana Loesch,” Mallory demanded.
Mallory then called for a formal apology from the gun rights organization.
“Issue an apology to the American people for the video you sponsored, which bears your name and logo, as it suggests armed violence against communities of color, progressives and anyone who does not agree with this Administration’s policies,” she added.
This poor Mallory woman is operating under the delusion that anyone in America cares what she thinks. It’s almost sad. Almost.

Suicide bombers kill nine people in four attacks in Nigeria,"June 26 (UPI) -- Seven suicide bombers killed nine people and injured 13 others in four attacks in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri, police said Monday.
The bombings occurred at the University of Maiduguri, which is the capital of Borno state, and in the Jere area of the city on Sunday night and Monday morning, state Commissioner of Police Damien Chukwu said at press briefing. All of the male and female attackers also died.
A male suicide bomber killed a female security guard at the entrance to the University of Maiduguri's Rapid Response Services Office at 10:20 p.m. Two other security personnel were injured, the police commissioner said.
One hour later, four female suicide bombers killed eight people and injured 11 others in Jere by detonating devices in residential buildings.
Around 4:20 a.m., two female suicide bombers were the only people to die in two blasts at the university's Center for Entrepreneurship and Enterprise Development and the Students Industrial Work Experience Scheme. The injured were transported to hospitals.
No group has claimed responsibility for the blasts in Maiduguri but Boko Haram often uses women to detonate bombs in the region.
The university first came under attack by Boko Haram on Jan. 16, when five people died, including a renowned professor of veterinary medicine and two suicide bombers. One explosion occurred at a staff mosque and the second was at an entrance gate on the university premises.

BREAKING: Trump Makes MAJOR Independence Day Announcement – Liberals HATE IT,"admin News, Politics, U.SLeave a comment
President Trump recently gave his very first Independence Day speech this past Saturday in front of crowds of civilian and military families. Now he’s made an announcement about his plans for the day, and liberals are not going to be very happy.
The Washington Examiner reports that President Trump is going to spend Independence Day at the White House with some of our fine military and their families for a night that they will never forget. The traditional dinner and festivities go back decades, and now we have a REAL reason to celebrate. Our country is finally back on the path to being GREAT again!
Their day is going to start out on the South Lawn for a picnic and time to sit outside and enjoy the weather. It is going to be an amazing occasion, and there are, without a doubt, going to be tales told from the brave soldiers attending the event.
After the picnic, everyone is going to gather on top of the Truman Balcony to get ready for the fireworks as dusk approaches. It is times like this that show how far we have come as a country, and how much work we still have yet to do.
Personally, we are hoping to see great coverage of heartwarming stories about veterans from around the country. Call it a hunch, but we have a feeling the mainstream news outlets are going to be using this occasion to ramble about talks of impeachment and treason.
It is pathetic that these people cannot get together for ONE day and honor our country. We should all be proud to be Americans and to celebrate each other on our Independence Day.
Instead, there is going to be mud slung from the Left all day long. They are going to be upset if they are unable to get a reaction from the president while he is handling IMPORTANT matters.
This situation is an excellent example of how the media treats our veterans on a day to day basis. These so-called “journalists” would rather talk about the myth that Trump and Russia are working together than discuss all of the good things Trump has done for veterans everywhere.
President Trump has fundamentally changed the way that our veterans are cared for, and not a word has been uttered about it from the MSM. The Left should be ashamed of themselves. While we are celebrating our independence from Great Britain and honoring our military, these guys are going to be spewing hate.
Nonetheless, tomorrow, let’s all remember the good things that happened this year. We are finally becoming the country we always knew we were capable of becoming. Our president is the best person we could ask for, FAR superior to our previous-called “president”. Finally, we have those close to us to appreciate on this day. Happy Independence Day!",Nevo News,1
Senators demand investigation of reports of torture in Yemen,"FILE PHOTO - Senator John McCain (R-AZ) speaks to reporters after Senate Republicans unveiled their version of legislation that would replace Obamacare on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 22, 2017.
FILE PHOTO - Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) questions National Security Agency Director Admiral Michael Rogers, commander of the U.S. Cyber Command, as he testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Capitol Hill Washington, D.C., U.S., May 9, 2017.
WASHINGTON The leaders of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee asked Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Friday to investigate any involvement of U.S. interrogators at secret prisons in Yemen where inmates have reportedly been tortured.
The Associated Press published a report on Wednesday that nearly 2,000 men have disappeared into a secret network of prisons in Yemen run by the United Arab Emirates or Yemeni forces trained by the Gulf nation, where they have been abused and tortured.
The UAE denied the allegations in a statement to AP.
The AP report said U.S. forces have been involved in interrogations of detainees, citing senior American defense officials.
The U.S. officials denied any participation in or knowledge of human rights abuses, but obtaining intelligence that may have been extracted by torture inflicted by another party would violate the International Convention Against Torture.
Senators John McCain, the Senate committee's Republican chairman, and Jack Reed, its ranking Democrat, asked Mattis to conduct an immediate review of the alleged abuses, including of U.S. support to the forces involved.
McCain, who was tortured as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, has been a leader of anti-torture efforts in Congress. In the letter, he and Reed argued that any suggestion the United States is complicit in torture hurts national security.
They also asked Mattis to assess what, if anything, U.S. forces knew about the alleged abuses and to provide a briefing to the committee as soon as possible.
""We are confident that you find these allegations as extremely troubling as we do,"" McCain and Reed wrote.

Gender Identity: Let’s Place Science Before Scientism And Sentiment,"Research into whether gender roles and preferences are innate has been ongoing since at least 2002. New Scientist reported in April 2008 that young male monkeys living in a wild environment preferred toys such as trucks and wheels while females of the same age – three to four months – preferred dolls. These studies were led by Kim Wallen of Emory University. Gerianne Alexander of Texas A&M found similar results with captive rhesus monkeys in 2012. Chimpanzees living wild in Uganda showed similar behavior patterns in a 14-year study led by Rick Wrangham of Harvard University and reported in National Geographic in 2010. The same result occurred in studies of macaques reported in 2014 by the BBC.
There is no such thing as a scientific consensus on any issue – for example, climate change and its causation, or the origin of gender identity – in terms of unified opinion. The relative impact of nature versus nurture in gender identity is debated, though studies cited above occurred in youngsters far too young to have been socialized into their preferences. Yet these studies present unitary findings. In short, there is a scientific consensus – in experimental results – on the innate presence of gender identity, inasmuch as there are no contradictory studies.
Contrast this phenomenon with the growing-toward-consensus among educational professionals in Australia and America – as two examples – that gender-biased reading materials damage boys and girls and must be removed from primary school classrooms. The number of people taking this position is growing without a shred of evidence to back it. It derives its authority from the “Ph.D.” following the names of those who agree. I know no better example of the distinction between the discipline of science and the religion of scientism.
Science is characterized by repeatable experimentation on testable hypotheses, evidence demanding a verdict, yet declining conclusion until evidence can be stockpiled. Scientism depends on repeatable dogma and on intimidation of those who defy current orthodoxy.
Please understand me: We brought much of the political correctness movement on ourselves. All the snide comments down the decades about women drivers, denying women the right to vote and even to inherit, expecting them to work only in professions that did not threaten men – when they were allowed to work at all – are chickens coming home to roost. Even today women tend to be paid less than men for the same work, and this assessment fails to acknowledge the demeaning and deadly discrimination against women that is so characteristic of Islamic and other cultures with no Christian background. The Church has been neither outspoken nor forceful in bringing about gender justice. But pseudo-science boasting no more backing than the opinions of self-styled experts is no solution.
How did women from Condoleezza Rice to Susan Rice to Nikki Haley become national security advisers, governors, U.N. ambassadors and heads of major corporations if the very toys they were given in school conspired against them? How did Madame Curie revolutionize medicine way back in the nineteenth century? How did Michele Bachmann, Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton manage to run for president? How did a housewife like Betsy DeVos help found an international corporate giant and then become secretary of education under supposed male chauvinist Donald Trump?
If we would help girls – and for that matter boys – to become all they are created to become, let us exercise the gift God gave us called scientific method. It is not so difficult. We need only make real policy of confronting stereotypes in the classroom instead of eliminating them – and thus eliminating the stimulus to overcome. Cinderella and Snow White were both victims of gender bias waiting for their princes-charming to come for them — yet Cinderella won a kingdom and Snow White whipped seven dwarves into shape. When the full truth is revealed – instead of suppressed for fear of hurting feelings – victims become viceroys of achievement. That is the hypothesis to be tested.
Experiment. Let authentic science trump weeping sentiment.
The God Who speaks through the Bible claims to work all things together for good in those who love Him and serve Him. That’s everybody. He says all things will be revealed to those who hang with Him. That’s everything. And finally He claims to perfect His strength – His ability to bless and care for – in our weakness. But it all presupposes His first claim – that not we but He is the author of all that is. When we set out to discover rather than re-invent to suit our wounds, we are setting out on a road to freedom and leaving our addictions behind.

"Senator Jeff Flake, Facing Twin Threats, Is Said to Take On G.O.P. Rift in New Book","Continue reading the main storyShare This Page

PHOENIX — Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, faces political challenges from both sides in seeking re-election next year: On the left, emboldened Democrats are aggressively recruiting candidates to run against him. On the right, allies of President Trump are devising ways to punish Mr. Flake for his outspoken rejection of Mr. Trump last year.
Yet Mr. Flake, seemingly undaunted, has secretly planned an unconventional campaign kickoff that risks intensifying both threats: Working privately, and largely without the knowledge of political advisers, he has written a book that amounts to an ideological manifesto for his own version of conservatism, according to three people briefed on the manuscript who discussed it on the condition of anonymity.
All three said it was likely to inflame debate about the direction of the Republican Party.
In his writing, Mr. Flake draws a bright-line distinction between his outlook on government and a competing vision, associated with Mr. Trump, that Mr. Flake describes as nationalist and populist in nature, the people said. Mr. Flake links himself closely with Barry Goldwater, the former senator and presidential candidate from Arizona.
By leaning into his differences with the president, Mr. Flake, 54, may help ensure that his re-election race unfolds as a dramatic clash over what it means to be a Republican in the age of Trump. While many politicians write books, it is highly unusual for a senator to do so without extensively consulting advisers, particularly when the subject matter is so politically charged.
Continue reading the main story
Even before Mr. Flake’s book, the Southwest was emerging as a pivotal testing ground for Mr. Trump’s leadership of the Republican Party. In neighboring Nevada, Senator Dean Heller, a fellow Republican, has faced threats of retribution from the White House for occasionally bucking the president’s agenda, most recently by panning an early version of the Senate health care bill. (Both Mr. Heller and Mr. Flake voted on Tuesday to move forward with a debate on the legislation.)

Democrats are preparing to compete heavily for both the Arizona and Nevada seats, viewing them as the best opportunities to defeat Republican incumbents in 2018.
In Arizona, Representative Kyrsten Sinema and Mayor Greg Stanton of Phoenix are both considering the race on the Democratic side, and State Representative Randy Friese is likely to run.
Wes Gullett, a Republican public relations executive who is a former adviser to Senator John McCain, said Mr. Flake’s book appeared to be part of a political strategy aimed both at defending himself on the right and at making overtures to the middle.
“Seize the Goldwater wing of the Republican Party and not alienate Republican and independent women who will decide the election in November,” Mr. Gullett said, describing Mr. Flake’s mission. “The way President Trump is headed, by the election next year, Trump may not be as popular amongst the right and Senator Flake will not be tied to him.”
Starting last year, Mr. Flake has consistently distanced himself from Mr. Trump and has instead presented himself as a traditional, small-government conservative. He was one of Mr. Trump’s most pointed Republican critics during the presidential race and rebuked Mr. Trump repeatedly for actions Mr. Flake described as “beyond the pale.”
Unlike Mr. Trump, Mr. Flake is an avowed fiscal hawk and a supporter of free trade and a comprehensive immigration overhaul. His position on immigration, especially, has often put him at odds with the Republican Party’s activist base in Arizona.

Robert Graham, a former state Republican Party chairman, and Jeff DeWit, the Arizona state treasurer, are both weighing bids against Mr. Flake. Kelli Ward, a former state senator who unsuccessfully ran against Mr. McCain last year, has already entered the Republican primary against Mr. Flake.
Mr. Graham said that White House advisers and political donors supportive of Mr. Trump were taking a close look at a number of 2018 Senate races, including those in Arizona and Nevada, to see where Republican incumbents might be replaced with people more supportive of the president.
Continue reading the main story
“If you have somebody that is, I will call it, an obstacle on virtually every aspect of an agenda,” Mr. Graham argued, “then if this person gets re-elected, they have six more years where they will be in office and will likely maintain that same disposition.”
Mr. Trump carried Arizona only narrowly against Hillary Clinton, but he remains popular with Republicans in the state.
Josh Daniels, Mr. Flake’s campaign manager, signaled in a statement that Mr. Flake, still in his first term, was confident of his prospects in the race.
“Senator Flake is a principled conservative fighting every day for the people of Arizona,” Mr. Daniels said. “We’re building a winning campaign powered by strong fund-raising and a dominant ground game.”
If the book may rankle some of Mr. Flake’s critics on the right, his allies hope it will help address a more basic problem: He is a relatively undefined personality in Arizona and lacks the formidable profile of the state’s senior senator, Mr. McCain.
Pausing under the scorching July sun to talk politics, Linda McSweeney, a Republican voter who works in business development, said she viewed Mr. Flake as a distant figure. “Nobody knows who he is,” said Ms. McSweeney, 55, who described herself as having reluctantly voted for Mr. Trump last year.
Yet in what could be a hopeful sign for Mr. Flake, Ms. McSweeney said she would favor a risk-taker in the Senate race.
“I like people that take chances and shake things up,” she said.

"Washington’s Syrian Chemical Attack Propaganda, Destroyed With a Few Basic Questions","July 1, 2017July 1, 2017 Christopher Kemmett 0 Comments
As if on cue, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons — putative watchdog of world government use of the noxious agents in its very name — announced Thursday sarin gas, or a sarin-like substance, had indeed caused the deaths of nearly 100 people in a supposed chemical ‘attack’ in Khan Sheikhoun in Syria in early April, which the U.S. and Western allies insist had been carried out against innocent civilians at the behest of the Assad regime.
Except, gaping holes and unavoidable discrepancies paint the report. In fact, the entire incident constitutes a monstrous propaganda campaign to enjoin support for ousting President Bashar al-Assad — an objective dear to the United States — no matter the repercussions.
According to the OPCW Fact-Finding Mission — which refused to assign responsibility for the attack until further collaboration with the United Nations — sarin or a sarin-like substance killed and injured scores of civilians in an “alleged” attack on April 4 in the Idlib Province town.
Superficially, this confirms an account by the Trump administration, which used the ‘attack’ to justify launching 59 retaliatory Tomahawk missiles into the sovereign nation — incidentally, also killing and injuring scores of innocents — in the first act of direct military aggression by the U.S. since a coalition of Western-backed forces entered the fray.
From the term, ‘attack,’ to culpability of the Syrian president, nearly every detail surrounding the horrific Khan Sheikhoun incident finds dispute in facts simply not presented by the corporate press and U.S. officials — who require your support to continue and escalate otherwise needless involvement in Syria.
Active military engagement in Syria — thus, profit, regime change, and domination — hinge on your acceptance of the chemical attack narrative.
In early April, news began circulating that hundreds of Syrian civilians suffered horrendous injuries and excruciating deaths from an unknown chemical agent officials first surmised to be sarin — a conclusion adhered to unquestioningly by the Trump administration and the hawkish mainstream press — which they claimed had been unleashed in a direct assault on civilians.
From the outset, however, that narrative didn’t add up.
Why would Assad — on the eve of negotiations to bring the first semblance of peace in years, no less — attack his own people, ensuring the full force of the largest military on the planet would swiftly bite back? He wouldn’t. No rationale — no motivation imaginable — fits the repertoire of any national leader seeking to maintain control over and the favor of the populace under their guidance.
Instead, as some surmised at the time, the cause of the mass chemical poisoning had been far less overtly malevolent. An airstrike carried out by Syrian forces, coordinated with Moscow, and announced to the U.S., decimated a former rebel-held depot housing chemical munitions, sending noxious gases aloft where wind disseminated contaminants into a populated area.
Almost immediately, Theodore Postol — professor of science, technology and national security policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — slayed a prominent video piece from mainstream media on the alleged attack, asserting, “NONE of the forensic evidence in the New York Times video and a follow-on Times news article supports the conclusions reported by the New York Times.”
Analyzing wind speed and direction, lack of appropriate protective gear for sarin worn by first responders, size of the crater left by the explosion, and a number of other mitigating details imperative to a fair examination of what actually occurred at Khan Sheikhoun, Postol scientifically eviscerated the ‘Assad attack’ propaganda.
Not that the corporate press or U.S. officials gave the esteemed professor’s critique the time of day.
Postol’s account of events gave doubters of the official story further vindication when award-winning journalist, Seymour Hersh, obtained internal communications between a security adviser and active duty U.S. soldier evincing astonishment Trump gave the green light to bomb Syria in response to the ‘attack’ — since, apparently, American forces were well aware no attack had taken place.
Despite curious calls for international, independent investigation, the U.S. and United Nations balked — claiming for months the situation on the ground too precarious to risk investigators’ lives.
Thus, the assumption of a Syrian government-ordered attack lived on — a fictitious yarn sufficiently appalling to engender popular support for the goal of ousting the ostensively evil brute, Assad. This isn’t to say the Syrian leader sits on bloodless hands; but, assigning false blame damages any shred of diplomacy and hope for the common goal of destroying the Islamic State — no matter the animosity otherwise stoked by the gordian knot that is the Syrian war.
Without further probe of the April 4 incident, Washington and its darling corporate presstitutes condemned the Assad regime for an attack that never occurred — guaranteeing, in the short run, the sleep-walking masses would fail to question putative ‘authorities’ on the matter.
But, as Washington continued loudly proffering the attack narrative as if steel truth, no investigation of Khan Sheikhoun ever took place on location.
Then, out of the blue this week, the Trump administration and mainstream media abruptly proclaimed — sans evidence, of course — the Assad regime intended to carry out ‘another’ ‘attack’ on civilians using chemical weapons. Convenient, in that the claim came with an astounding assertion any such ‘attacks’ would inarguably be at the behest of Assad — giving the U.S. a self-aggrandized impetus for again acting aggressively against the forces of the elected Syrian government and its none-too shrinking violet ally, Russia.
If anyone attacks anyone in Syria with chemical agents, the U.S. sanctimoniously whined, Assad did it — and he will pay in another onslaught of retaliatory airstrikes — no questions asked, no investigation initiated, no ounce of due diligence to determine the actual perpetrator necessary.
When independent journalists in alternative media shredded this threadbare, pre-blame ploy as a setup to initiate another round of aggressive airstrikes by the U.S. military, Washington declared via the corporate press its warning about an impending, nebulous Assad-ordered atrocity effectively foiled said attack.
In other words, the temper tantrum of a baseless prognostication and an as-yet unnecessary allegation scared a nation’s leader into re-thinking his plan to kill innocent people who might otherwise support his rein.
Compounding the idiocy unfolding across self-righteous headlines, the OPCW suddenly stepped up to the plate — after nearly two months of scoffing, stalling, and deflecting — announcing within hours of the farce that is a foiled non-attack its Fact Finding Mission found the April ‘attack’ had been carried out using sarin. Or, maybe, a sarin-like substance.
To reiterate, OPCW never visited the site.
Claiming unsafe conditions, not a single member of the chemical weapons watchdog group traveled to Khan Sheikhoun to interview survivors, test samples, or otherwise diligently investigate the purely ephemeral claim Assad gassed his people. Not one.
Trust us, OPCW thus says — mirroring the equally logic-defying argument Washington spews — ‘It’s true because we told the world it’s true.’
What we’re being told about Syria holds little basis in reality — in fact, just a cursory glance dismantles nearly the entire voluminous body of pro-regime change propaganda crafted by the U.S.
Acknowledgment and an education in the facts, however, will do nothing to stave off foolhardiness existent in igniting a full scale war with Russia and other Syrian allies — which will happen if Washington continues prodding Damascus with the stick of pompous accusation in its own sandbox.
Assad and Vladimir Putin have thus far displayed an exemplary paragon of patience for the Trump administration’s impudent ramblings and military force — but indications are that won’t continue much longer.
After all, if the U.S. wants to fight terrorists — such as the farcically termed ‘moderate rebels’ it supports in myriad ways — the offer of cooperation with its traditional foes still stands.
Until then, facts belie true intent — and the sovereign nation of Syria maintains as any the right to defend itself against an invading and aggressive force.

Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday fired up a crowd of Kennedy Space Center employees with the promise of American boots on Mars and “the dawn of a new era of space exploration,” but offered few details about how those goals would be accomplished.
“America will lead in space once again,” Pence said during a 23-minute speech inside the Vehicle Assembly Building . “Here from this bridge to space, our nation will return to the moon and we will put American boots on the face of Mars.”

“I’m particularly excited to see the increased collaboration with our burgeoning commercial space industry so much in evidence here at the Kennedy Space Center,” he said. “Kennedy Space Center is proof that public and private sectors can achieve more by working together than they could ever achieve working apart.”
Since 2011, NASA has turned over a launch pad to SpaceX, former shuttle hangars to Boeing and the Department of Defense, and a runway to Space Florida.

Pence said the Trump administration’s re-establishment last week of a National Space Council that he will chair will fill a more than two-decade void in national space policy and leadership.
The council, which had been dormant since 1993, will attempt to review policies, better coordinate them among various agencies and solicit input from outside advisers.
More: KSC to welcome Vice President Pence today
Pence said the revived council would meet for the first time later this summer. Analysts are uncertain whether it will prove influential or create another layer of bureaucracy in Washington.
Otherwise, Pence offered no hints about how NASA’s exploration strategy might change in the next few years, or promises of increased funding that might make lofty goals more achievable.
NASA’s current plan is to send astronauts into orbit around the moon in the 2020s, then to orbit around Mars as soon as 2033, a timeline many consider unrealistic. The Space Launch System and Orion may not launch astronauts for the first time until 2023.

Some might have interpreted Pence’s promise of a return to the moon as meaning astronauts will land there again — a major change — but he might simply have been referring to plans for a small outpost in lunar orbit.
Commercial space advocates probably liked his statement that ""with our commercial partners, we’ll continue to make space travel safer, cheaper and more accessible than ever before.""

Trump’s $19.1 billion request for NASA next year is a slight cut to the space agency’s budget, not an increase. The cut largely affects Earth science missions and education programs, and Pence said the administration would “reorient America’s space program towards human space exploration.”
The Coalition for Deep Space Exploration, an industry group of 70 companies including major NASA contractors, applauded Pence's remarks.
""We welcome the commitment of this administration to maintain a presence in low Earth orbit, return to the Moon and go to Mars and beyond,” said director Mary Lynne Dittmar.
Phil Larson, a former Obama administration and SpaceX official, said the speech lacked details.
""It was heartening to see him allude to growing public-private partnerships, but the lack of policy details, personnel and budgetary priorities is concerning,"" said Larson, an assistant dean at the University of Colorado at Boulder. ""Usually you have a leader visit, tour and give a speech to roll out a detail-oriented policy after it’s been developed. This is backwards.""

Pence arrived at KSC aboard Air Force Two, touching down on the former space shuttle runway at 12:24 p.m.
After his speech in the VAB, a motorcade surrounded by armed guards traveled south to the building where NASA and Lockheed Martin are preparing an Orion capsule for an unmanned first launch atop the 322-foot SLS rocket, targeted for 2019.
KSC Director Bob Cabana, Robert Lightfoot, NASA’s acting administrator, and astronauts Patrick Forrester and Reid Wiseman showed Pence pieces of the capsule’s heat shield and its pressurized crew cabin.
Pence continued his tour from a black limousine that drove by various facilities. He passed KSC’s two launch pads, one that NASA’s big SLS rocket will use and the other leased by SpaceX, which launched a commercial satellite mission Wednesday evening.

Pence earlier joked that he had prayed for rain to delay the SpaceX launch to Thursday.
The tour wound back past the mobile launch tower that will carry the SLS to its pad, then by former shuttle hangars now housing commercial and military missions.
“This is now how space used to be done,” Lightfoot said before introducing Pence at the VAB, referring to the combination of government and commercial missions at KSC.
Air Force Two took off at 3:40 p.m., ending Pence's visit of just over three hours.

Pence’s tour of KSC followed stops last month at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, where he welcomed a new astronaut class, and Air Force Space Command in Colorado Springs.
He was the seventh vice president to visit KSC, according to NASA records. The others were Lyndon Johnson, Hubert Humphrey, Spiro Agnew, George Bush, Dan Quayle and Dick Cheney.
Prior to becoming vice president, Pence, a former governor and congressman from Indiana, said he had seen and been inspired by several shuttle launches.
Now he said the Trump administration and National Space Council would re-energize the nation's pioneering spirit and restore confidence that it can achieve the impossible.
""Welcome to a new era of American leadership in space,"" he said.

Supreme Court Protects Immigrants And Gives Trump A Unanimous Middle Finger,"On June 22, the Supreme Court dealt a blow to any attempt to strip naturalized citizens of their citizenship by the increasingly anti-immigrant Trump administration.
A case was ruled unanimously in favor of one Divna Maslejak, who was deported to Serbia when she lied about her husband’s military service after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Ms. Maslejak came to the United States with her two children and husband in 2000, with refugee status, under fear of persecution by Muslims in Bosnia.
In 2007, Maslejak became of a citizen of the United States but neglected to disclose her husband’s military service in the Bosnian Serb Army brigade, that carried out a massacre of 8,000 Muslims in Srebrenica.
The court said that if someone lies on their immigration application, and said lie did not influence the decision to make them a citizen, they will not have their citizenship stripped.
The Trump Administration has made it known that it believes that any lie should be grounds for deportation and the stripping of citizenship, keeping with the policies of the Obama administration that deported more people than any other president.
Though the court case is over, it is expected that this will be another skirmish in the Trump administration’s long battle with the Judicial branch.
The court decision is comparable to a sigh of relief from both immigrants and the average American. If there was precedent for the government to strip citizens of their citizenship because they lied about even the tiniest of things, what would be next?

Beware the Illusion of South China Sea Calm,"U.S. littoral combat ship USS Coronado (LCS 4) steams independently during operations in the South China Sea in February 2017.
 
The cooling down some are playing up masks underlying tensions and broader strategic realities.
A year after the supposedly game-changing arbitral tribunal ruling on the Philippines’ South China Sea case against China, the region appears to have entered another period of calm that some are happy to play up. But though a superficial glance might suggest that a cooling down period is truly at play in the South China Sea, a deeper look points to the reality that any calm is illusory at best and shows few signs of lasting.
The illusion of calm in the post-ruling context is due to a confluence of various factors. Chief among them is the election of Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines last June, which, at least for now, has seen Manila shift from the most forward-leaning Southeast Asian claimant in the face of Chinese assertiveness to a laggard, downplaying the South China Sea issue and the ruling it had sought in a bid to reset ties with Beijing (See: “The Limits of Duterte’s US-China Rebalance”).
Though Duterte is often singled out as the main factor in the perceived changing the strategic environment in the South China Sea, the reality is that others have either been complicit in this change or have benefited from it (See: “The Truth About Duterte’s ASEAN South China Sea Blow”). Most obviously, China has exploited this idea of what its officials like to term “cooling down” for now, playing up what is at best a skeletal draft framework on the code of conduct and shutting down attempts by non-claimants to interfere as it remains preoccupied with the 19th Party Congress later this year.

Among Southeast Asian states, though a few, particularly Vietnam, remain anxious about this period of illusory calm, the other two Southeast Asian claimants, Malaysia and Brunei, do find some comfort in the fact that they, as one Southeast Asian official put it to me in June, “have just some time to breathe.” This reflects not just the divisions within ASEAN on the South China Sea issue, but also other dynamics beyond the issue itself such as the changing threat environment brought about by the Islamic State’s advances in the subregion, domestic politics with upcoming elections in Malaysia and Indonesia (a non-claimant but interested party, as I have noted before), and the growing pressure China is asserting on individual Southeast Asian states – from Vietnam to Singapore (See: “China: New White Paper, Old Asia Conundrum”).
This complicity does not stop at the region itself. The election of Donald Trump had initially played into the illusion of calm in the South China Sea as well. Rather than the more hawkish U.S. China policy many in the region were expecting given Hillary Clinton’s views as well of those articulated by some of Trump’s advisers during the campaign, the initial wild swings we saw in the administration’s approach to Beijing had given rise to the idea that we could see a tacit agreement by the two powers to downplay the South China Sea issue in favor of cooperation on North Korea (See: “Trump’s Real ASEAN Test”).
This view, still held in some Southeast Asian capitals that worry about the unpredictability of Trump’s transactional approach to diplomacy, tends to intensify doubts about U.S. credibility and reinforce unilateral actions, and, to a much lesser extent, intra-ASEAN cooperation and hedging tendencies.
But a deeper look suggests that any kind of “cooling down” in the South China Sea is illusory. First, though major forms of destabilizing behavior have been absent, tensions continue to simmer and in some cases have already begun to boil over.
Most notably, as data from the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative has illustrated, even as China engages in negotiations with ASEAN states over the draft framework of the COC, Beijing has shown no signs of stopping the construction of military and dual-use facilities on the Spratly Islands, which violates the DOC and President Xi Jinping’s own non-militarization pledge and only confirms that it is bent on assuming de facto control of the South China Sea.
ASEAN states are well aware of this reality, and so they too have continued pursuing their own unilateral steps quietly and at times publicly to safeguard their claims even as they continue on the negotiating track with Beijing. More visible steps of late have included Indonesia’s recent announcement of the North Natuna Sea designation and the Sino-Vietnamese tussle, allegedly over the typical range of issues from energy exploitation to Vietnam’s foreign alignments (See: “Why Did Indonesia Just Rename its Part of the South China Sea?”). But to that we must also add quieter moves that are notable too, including Malaysia’s hardening rhetoric and tougher enforcement against maritime encroachments even as Prime Minister Najib Razak continues to engage Beijing on issues like its Belt and Road Initiative.
Meanwhile, the United States and other extraregional powers have not let up on the South China Sea issue, even if they may be quieter now about what they are doing. U.S. kinetic actions in the South China Sea – from the much-ballyhooed but often poorly understood freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs) to much more frequent presence operations – have continued and in some cases even accelerated (See: “What Mattis’ Shangri-La Dialogue Speech Revealed About Trump’s Asia Policy”).
Other influential actors, such as Japan, India, and Australia have also continued a range of measures designed to assist Southeast Asian states who are more than happy to oblige, no doubt realizing that unless they get the external assistance to close the vast asymmetry in naval, coast guard, and aerial capabilities between them and Beijing, they will essentially be acquiescing to Chinese control of the South China Sea that would not be in their interests for a stable balance of power in the region.
Second, there is reason to expect underlying tensions are likely to boil over sooner than later and put an end to this period of illusory calm.
The pattern of Chinese behavior over the past few years in the South China Sea suggests that any brief period of calm such as this one is likely nothing more than temporary tactical maneuvering rather than some sort of strategic rethinking that some keep hoping for. As I have repeatedly pointed out, including last year just as we began to enter this so-called cooling down period, the evidence indicates that Beijing tends to calibrate its assertiveness with alternating periods of charm and coercion (See: “Beware the Illusion of China-ASEAN South China Sea Breakthroughs”).
For instance, just seven months after unveiling a new strategy for ASEAN-China relations as part of a new charm offensive in Southeast Asia, China moved an oil rig into Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone in the summer of 2014. And in spite of hopes that China may change its South China Sea approach in 2015 – which Beijing had declared “the year of ASEAN-China maritime cooperation” – it ultimately sped up its island-building activities while continuing to intrude into the waters of some ASEAN states and stonewall negotiations on a COC. Though this time might be different, history suggests that this would be a bad bet to make.
Thus, there is every reason to expect that Beijing will at some point step on the gas pedal in the South China Sea once again, whether it be infringements into ASEAN states’ waters from its outposts in the Spratlys that many expect or even bolder cost-imposition strategies on claimant and non-claimant Southeast Asian states designed to both test their resilience and further divide ASEAN. Even though China carefully calibrates its actions tactically, it has shown few signs of departing from its strategic objective of acquiring the full range of capabilities required for control of the South China Sea.
Given this, ASEAN states are unlikely to stop their own unilateral efforts to safeguard their claims to not just particular areas of the South China Sea, but the resources therein. Indeed, these actions could even accelerate soon. The public announcement by a Philippine energy official last week that drilling for oil and gas on the Reed Bank could resume before the end of the year – a move that would be consistent with the tribunal ruling but nonetheless would rankle Beijing – was an important reminder of how tensions could flare up if the clock runs out on Duterte’s charm offensive aimed at China.
Meanwhile, in the United States, as the Trump administration continues to test the limits of engagement with China on issues ranging from North Korea to economic collaboration, hawkish voices, which had already begun gaining ground in Washington towards the end of the Obama administration, are getting even louder. Compared to 2009, when we first began to see the first signs of Chinese maritime assertiveness,in Washington it is much more common now to hear the South China Sea issue being framed as a test of American credibility and case study in how a rising China plans on treating its neighbors (See: “US South China Sea Policy After the Ruling: Opportunities and Challenges”).
If U.S.-China ties sour even more and we see Beijing undertake more provocative measures, such as reclaiming Scarborough Shoal or declaring an air defense identification zone (ADIZ) over the South China Sea, we should not rule out the possibility of the United States taking some of the bolder cost imposition measures that have long been debated in think tank circles, and ones I had outlined in these pages back years earlier (See: “The Case for a Bolder US South China Sea Policy”).
More broadly, though some Chinese interlocutors had grown fond of Trump’s transactional approach, it is worth noting that this narrow worldview is a double-edged sword. Deals may be easily made, but they are also easily broken, and relationships based on deals can quickly go south because they are based more on impulses in a divided administration than deeply-held worldviews in a more unified one (relatively speaking) under Obama. Within a U.S. foreign policy context, the U.S. president is also of many actors, and to conflate the views of the president who has no prior foreign policy experience with the overall course the administration ends up adopting would be a serious mistake.
As some continue to obsess over details in this period of illusory calm in the South China Sea, be it the specifics in the draft framework of the code of conduct or Duterte’s pro-China rhetoric, it is worth bearing the broader strategic perspective in mind.

"Davies, power bats launch Brewers over Nationals 8-0","Milwaukee Brewers starting pitcher Zach Davies delivers a pitch during the first inning of a baseball game against the Washington Nationals, Tuesday, July 25, 2017, in Washington. (AP Photo/Nick Wass)
 
WASHINGTON — Travis Shaw, Eric Thames and Manny Pina homered, Zach Davies tossed 7 2/3 shutout innings and the Milwaukee Brewers beat the Washington Nationals 8-0 on Tuesday night.
Shaw’s three-run blast highlighted a four-run fourth inning. Thames and Pina went back-to-back off Edwin Jackson (1-1) in the fifth for the NL Central-leading Brewers. Milwaukee, which had lost six of seven to open its 10-game road trip, maintained a half-game lead over the Chicago Cubs.
Davies (12-4) allowed three hits and struck out seven to win his fifth consecutive decision. He drove in the Brewers’ first run when he bunted toward the mound with runners on first and third in the second inning and Pina raced home ahead of Jackson’s throw.
Bryce Harper struck out twice for the NL East-leading Nationals, but his eighth-inning double off Oliver Drake extended his hitting streak to a career-high 17 games. Harper is batting .426 (29 for 68) during his streak.
Jackson, who made 31 starts for Washington in 2012, began his second stint with the club a week ago with seven solid innings in a win over the Angels. In his encore performance, Jackson allowed seven runs — three earned — in five innings.
After Orlando Arcia’s one-out single in the fourth, Davies pushed his sacrifice bunt toward first base and reached on Ryan Zimmerman’s wild throw. Ryan Braun’s RBI single and Shaw’s homer extended Milwaukee’s lead to 5-0. All four runs in the inning were unearned.
Brewers: RHP Brandon Woodruff (hamstring) was reinstated from the disabled list and optioned to Triple-A Colorado Springs. Woodruff allowed eight runs — four earned — and five hits in two-thirds of an inning Monday during a rehab start.
Nationals: RHP Stephen Strasburg, who left Sunday’s start after two innings with forearm pain, is expected to start Friday against the Colorado Rockies. The right-hander was diagnosed with a nerve impingement that is no longer a problem. “The doctor said he’s doing fine. Hoping he’ll progress enough to make the next start,” manager Dusty Baker said.
Brewers: RHP Jimmy Nelson (8-5, 3.43 ERA) is 1-1 with a 5.28 ERA in three career starts against Washington.
Nationals: LHP Gio Gonzalez (8-5, 2,83) has a 2.67 ERA in four July starts, but is 1-3 in those appearances.

"After GOP chokes on Obamacare, Bernie leads charge on our WORST nightmare","To the victor goes the spoils?
Following the failure of the skinny bill – generally seen as the GOP’s
last-ditch effort to repeal and replace Obamacare – leading Democrats are now pushing towards the end zone to achieve their ultimate goal: a single-payer healthcare system.
Senator Bernie Sanders happily announced as much today during an interview on CNN.
 New report comes out guaranteed to IRRITATE Trump's criticsThis comparison shows exactly why conservatism TRUMPS liberalism
As reported by The Hill: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said Sunday that he will “absolutely” introduce legislation on single-payer healthcare now that the Senate GOP’s bill to repeal Obamacare has failed.
“Of course we are, we’re tweaking the final points of the bill and we’re figuring out how we can mount a national campaign to bring people together,” Sanders told Jake Tapper on CNN’s State of the Union.
The full interview can be seen here:
(This certainly calls into question Senator McCain’s belief that the Democrats are going to leap at the opportunity for a bipartisan solution to amend Obamacare now that the GOP has failed to repeal it, doesn’t it?)
Sanders does not go into detail about the bill but perhaps BernieSanders.com can provide some insight into the sort of “federally administered single-payer health care program” will propose.
Sanders boasts on his page that this program will allow people “to start new businesses, stay home with their children or leave jobs they don’t like;” free patients from reaching into their wallets for anything other than their ID card (no co-pays, deductibles, coinsurance payments, or minimal premiums); and save the U.S. taxpayer $6 trillion dollars over 10 years to boot.
However, according to economist Chris Conover, Sanders’ “open bar-style plan” may actually cost taxpayers much more than Sanders claims, “The new federal taxes required to fund the Sanders health plan will be $36.3 trillion. In short, the Sanders health plan would require a 71 percent increase in federal spending over the next decade.”
Even the massive increase in taxes Sanders proposes to pay for his universal health care plan won’t be enough if Dr. Conover’s estimate is at least close to being right. Not only would the government have to heavily tax everyone who breathes and everything that moves to pay for free healthcare, one can reasonably expect government to deny healthcare services to some in order to save money.
As Sarah Palin once wrote, “government health care will not reduce the cost; it will simply refuse to pay the cost. And who will suffer the most when they ration care? The sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course.”
And as Charlie Gard’s parents will attest, having the government make one’s health care decisions for them is indeed a very frightening prospect.

Blog | State Governors Set a Bipartisan Example on Health Care,"Find out how you can get more involved!
Looking at Congress, you’d think that it’s impossible to find a bipartisan agreement on health care.
Don’t tell that to America’s governors.
As the health care debate rages on Capitol Hill, governors from both parties have come together to find bipartisan consensus on health care reform. Just yesterday, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, held a joint press conference demanding that Congress work across the aisle to fix Obamacare’s struggling exchanges.
Other state executives have followed suit. On Monday, the chair and vice chair of the National Governors Association Virginia’s Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Massachusetts’s Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, sent a joint letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) asking him to postpone a vote on his health care bill until states have had adequate time to analyze the bill’s effects.
Governors know all too well how legislation passed by Congress can impact individual citizens. For example, many of these governors saw thousands of their citizens get health insurance after the passage of Obamacare. Since then they’ve also watched insurers pull out of exchanges and average deductibles and premiums in their states rise as a result.
But they also know that according to the Congressional Budget Office the House and Senate proposals could create health care hardships for working-class families, for the disabled and for victims of opioid addiction.
No one disputes that the American health care system needs fixing. But partisan proposals thus far have simply not worked. Members of Congress should follow the example of America’s governors and work together to craft workable bipartisan solutions. The health of millions of Americans depends on it.

Indonesia Bans Hard-Line Islamist Group Behind Mass Rallies,"Continue reading the main storyShare This Page

JAKARTA, Indonesia — The Indonesian government on Wednesday officially banned a hard-line Islamist group that wants to establish a global caliphate and that organized protests that rocked the country last year.
The move against the group, Hizbut Tahrir, has been hailed by pluralist Muslim groups as a necessary step for halting the rise of radical Islam. But conservative Muslim organizations and human rights groups criticized the decision as unnecessarily punitive.
“It’s a sad day for Indonesia’s fledgling democracy,” said Andreas Harsono, Indonesia director of Human Rights Watch. “Hizbut Tahrir might be a controversial group but it should have the right to appeal the banning.”
The government banned the group under powers granted by a new presidential decree last week that progressive civil society groups widely opposed. Under that decree, organizations that are banned by the government lose their right to appeal.

The pluralist government announced its intention to ban Hizbut Tahrir with much fanfare in May, arguing that the group’s call for the creation of a global caliphate was a rejection of the Constitution and pluralist state ideology.

Banning the organization has become the government’s signature move in confronting the rise of hard-line Islamism in Indonesia, whose generally moderate brand of Islam is seen as under threat by hard-line forces.
That challenge was highlighted in April, when Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, Jakarta’s governor and the country’s highest-ranking Christian politician, was voted out of office after Hizbut Tahrir and other hard-line Muslim groups staged mass rallies against him. Mr. Basuki was later sentenced to two years in prison for blasphemy after making comments deemed insulting to Islam.
Mr. Basuki was a close ally of the pluralist president, Joko Widodo. Analysts see the government’s efforts to ban Hizbut Tahrir as part of a broader effort by Mr. Joko to rein in the hard-line Islamist forces opposed to his administration before presidential elections in 2019.
Thanks to aggressive moves by Mr. Joko’s administration, many of the Islamist leaders who led the campaign against Mr. Basuki are in exile or prison.
Rizieq Shihab, the leader of the hard-line Islamic Defenders Front, has been named a suspect in a pornography case after being accused of sending racy texts messages to a female follower; he fled to Saudi Arabia to avoid a police summons. Muhammad al Khaththath, another hard-line leader who oversaw one of the major demonstrations against Mr. Basuki, is currently in prison, charged with attempting a coup.

Hizbut Tahrir, however, is the first Islamic organization to be officially banned by the government instead of its leaders facing charges at an individual level.
Mohammad Nuruzzaman, head of strategic research for Ansor, a pluralist Muslim youth organization whose paramilitary divisions have aggressively disrupted Hizbut Tahrir gatherings, welcomed the decision to officially ban the group.
“Hizbut Tahrir doesn’t openly call for violence,” Mr. Nuruzzaman said. But he added: “It threatens Indonesia’s national ideology and constitution. That’s why we support the ban.”
Continue reading the main story
Taufik Andrie, a terrorism expert who is the director of the Institute for International Peace Building, worried that the ban would lead some followers of Hizbut Tahrir to embrace terrorism.
“I worry that members of the Hizbut Tahrir who are disappointed with the decision will view the government as repressive, and will shift from nonviolence to violence,” he said.
Many countries have banned Hizbut Tahrir, including China, Germany and some Arab countries, often because its call for a global caliphate is seen as a challenge to fundamental state ideology.
Still, experts cautioned that the ban may not be effective. Hizbut Tahrir functioned as an underground university-based organization during the Suharto dictatorship in the 1980s and 1990s, and may well try to return to those roots.
“Of all the Islamic organizations in Indonesia, this is the one that’s most likely to be able to survive underground,” said Ken Ward, a former intelligence analyst with the Australian government who has studied the group, citing its secrecy.

OJ Simpson granted parole after serving nine years of armed robbery sentence,"Former NFL star famously acquitted of murder expected to be released from prison in October after serving minimum portion of 33-year sentence
OJ Simpson paroled by Nevada board after nine years in jail
 
Former NFL star famously acquitted of murder expected to be released from prison in October after serving minimum portion of 33-year sentence
Amanda Holpuch in New York
Thursday 20 July 2017 15.06 EDTLast modified on Thursday 20 July 2017 18.45 EDT
OJ Simpson, the former NFL star famously acquitted of murder, was granted parole on Thursday and is expected to walk free in October after being jailed nine years ago for a botched robbery attempt.
“I am sorry the things turned out the way they did,” Simpson, 70, said via videoconference with the Nevada board of parole commissioners. “I had no intention to commit a crime.”
Four commissioners voted unanimously to grant Simpson’s parole after a nearly 90-minute hearing.
Simpson smiled as the four commissioners announced their ruling one by one; he bowed multiple times after the 4-0 decision was announced.
As he left the courtroom, he thanked the people around him and put his hand to his heart before clasping his hands together while bowing slightly toward the commissioners.
“It was a serious crime and there was no excuse for it,” said commissioner Tony Corda, but he said he reached the decision because Simpson was at “low risk to re-offend” and had served enough prison time in the case.
Simpson was convicted of robbery, kidnapping and assault charges in October 2008 after a bizarre incident in which he, with armed men, attempted to retrieve sports memorabilia he said belonged to him from a Las Vegas hotel room.
Simpson has served the minimum nine years of his 33-year sentence for the robbery and could be released as early as 1 October, which is guaranteed to spark a media frenzy.
Parole commissioners questioned Simpson from the state capital, Carson City, and he responded via videoconference from the Lovelock correctional center, more than 100 miles away.
Simpson’s hearing was broadcast live on television, an echo of the so-called Trial of the Century in 1995, when Simpson was tried, and acquitted, in the murder of of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman.
OJ Simpson parole decision partly due to 'lack of previous convictions' – video
On Thursday, Simpson was jovial and occasionally combative with the commissioners as he answered questions about the robbery, reiterating his position that he was simply trying to retrieve his possessions.
“I’m not a guy who has conflicts on the street,” Simpson said. “I’m a guy who’s got along with just about everybody.”
When asked how he would handle public scrutiny, Simpson responded that he had been used to it since he was a star football player at age 19, going on to become an NFL star and actor. “I am pretty easily approachable. I’ve dealt with it my whole life,” he said.
His eldest daughter, Arnelle Simpson, spoke on her father’s behalf, describing him as her “best friend and rock”. “No one really knows how much we’ve been through, this ordeal in the last nine years,” she said.
One of the two robbery victims, Bruce Fromong, also took the stand in Simpson’s defense.
“I’m here to say that I’ve known OJ for a long time,” Fromong said. “I don’t feel he’s a threat to anyone out there.”
Simpson was acquitted over the murders of his ex-wife and Goldman, but held liable for their deaths in a February 1997 civil trial brought by Goldman’s family, who have been pursuing justice for their son since he died in 1994. The civil charge brought a $33m penalty, which bankrupted Simpson, though he was able to live a comfortable life off his NFL pension.
Simpson had retreated to suburban Florida, where he lived relatively quietly until he wrote a book explaining how he would have committed the double murder had he been inclined to do so. It was released in 2007, months before he was arrested in Las Vegas for the attempted robbery.
Simpson was sentenced in December 2008 for 12 criminal charges including kidnapping and armed robbery after being found guilty of holding up sports memorabilia dealers in room 1203 at Las Vegas’s Palace Station hotel and casino in September 2007.
At the 2008 trial, jurors heard recordings secretly made of the hotel room confrontation, where Simpson can be heard instructing men to take items that had been stolen from him.
“I did not mean to hurt anyone, I did not mean to steal anything, just my own stuff,” Simpson told the judge before his sentencing in December 2008. “I just wanted my personal things back ... I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt anybody.”
The judge, Jackie Glass, emphasized at the sentencing hearing that Simpson’s sentence was not tied to his past actions.
Nearly 10 years later, at the Thursday hearing, one of the parole commissioners, Connie Bisbee, also alluded to Simpson’s history.
“Mr Simpson, you are getting the same hearing that everybody else gets,” Bisbee said, prompting a hint of laughter from Simpson and his attorney.
Another parole commissioner, Susan Jackson, said they had received hundreds of letters of support and opposition for Simpson, and that most of the letters of opposition mentioned the 1995 murder trial. Jackson said that trial would not be considered in their decision.
Twenty years on, the 1995 trial has not faded from the spotlight, inspiring a television mini-series in 2016 and the documentary, OJ: Made in America, which won the documentary feature Oscar in 2017.
And for the family of the victims, the trial is still a prescient reminder that no one has been found guilty for the two deaths.
The father and sister of Goldman, Fred and Kim Goldman, said on Thursday before the hearing that they did not expect to see justice for his death.
Fred Goldman told Good Morning America on Thursday he would be upset if Simpson was paroled.
“What’s troubling to me is not only him, but the whole system gives second chances to violent felons or, for that matter, anyone in jail,” he said. “Ron doesn’t get a second chance.”
After Simpson’s acquittal in 1995, the Goldmans continued to pursue charges and brought a civil suit against him.
The Goldman family also published Simpson’s book If I Did It, which lays out how the murders would have transpired, had he committed them. The publisher, HarperCollins, withdrew the book just before it was published, but the Goldman family won rights to the book and published it under the title If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer in an effort to recoup funds they were owed from the civil trial.
“We lived our life with [Simpson] walking the streets and sharing the same roads that we did,” Goldman’s sister, Kim, told Good Morning America. “With him being locked up in Lovelock, it’s been a chance for us to kind of reclaim some control over our life and have some glimpse of sanity.

This ego maniacal Marxist decried what he believes to be intolerance against this faction.
It’s ironic, the very cabal he is defending from intolerance, is in fact, THE MOST INTOLERANT GROUP in the world for many centuries. They murder individuals who are Christian, Jewish, gay, & even those who are not from their specific sect of Islam!
& while we are at it, let’s dispel his ridiculous argument about the erosion of press freedom. Apparently, Obama wants ONLY the media to have free speech rights.
No one in American leadership today is denying the media their right to publish anything. We are simply calling the press out for narratives that are false. If they wish to continue purveying their lies, they will move closer to irrelevancy every day.
If Obama wants President Trump’s criticism of the press to stop, he is actually advocating for the violation of a citizen’s right to free speech against falsehoods, which denies us our redress of grievances when the media defends government tyranny through propaganda.
What’s even more ironic, the hypocrisy of Barack & his leftist cohorts is glaring when we look back at their incessant oppression of conservative radio. They were constantly calling for censorship of this media brand because it challenged their failed ideas, & they needed to shut it down to preserve their fist of iron grip upon the population. To them, freedom of the press was a useful tool ONLY for their media minions. All dissenting journalists did not deserve such liberties.
Let’s take a look at the specifics of Obama’s speech, courtesy of Western Journalism:
Former President Barack Obama delivered a speech overseas Saturday, warning that some nations are becoming too nationalistic.
Speaking to a crowd in Jakarta, Indonesia, Obama argued some countries had adopted “an aggressive kind of nationalism,” adding that there has been an “increased resentment of minority groups.”
Though he largely stayed away from discussing President Donald Trump, Obama spoke out against the isolationism and increased nationalism that he sees as a global problem.
We start seeing a rise in sectarian politics, we start seeing a rise in an aggressive kind of nationalism, we start seeing both in developed and developing countries an increased resentment about minority groups and the bad treatment of people who don’t look like us or practice the same faith as us – Barack Obama
Obama also emphasized the importance eliminating intolerance around the world.
If we don’t stand up for tolerance and moderation and respect for others, if we begin to doubt ourselves and all that we have accomplished, then much of the progress that we have made will not continue, Obama said.
What we will see is more and more people arguing against democracy, we will see more and more people who are looking to restrict freedom of the press, and we’ll see more intolerance, more tribal divisions, more ethnic divisions, and religious divisions and more violence, he added.
The former president said that during his presidency, he “wasn’t worried about what was in the newspapers” on a daily basis but was more concerned with his legacy 20 years down the road.
Obama praised the Paris Climate Accord, calling it “the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change,” but denounced “the temporary absence of American leadership,” referring to Trump’s decision in June to remove the United States from the agreement.
Speaking in the Muslim-majority country, Obama argued people must respect those of all faiths.
My stepfather … was raised a Muslim but he respected Hindus and he respected Buddhists and he respected Christians, he said.
If you are strong in your own faith then you should not be worried about someone else’s faith, Obama added.
Joseph Curl of the Daily Wire criticized Obama’s claim that “the world is at a crossroads,” writing, “But not America. That ‘crossroads’ came and went in Election 2016. Americans chose America First.”",C.S.C. Media Group U.S.,1
C-SPAN caller goes berserk over single moms taking us ‘back to the caveman age where men just bred women’,"04 Jul 2017 at 11:26 ET
C-SPAN host speaks to caller from Alaska (screen grab)
Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story!
A Republican caller on Tuesday told C-SPAN that single mothers were responsible for taking America back to the “caveman age.”
Paul, a Vietnam Veteran from Alaska, launched an attack on single mothers during C-SPAN’s Washington Journal, suggesting that liberals had relegated men to the role of sperm donors.
“For example, girls, 40 percent of the women now are without husbands to support their children,” Paul said.
“That’s regressive!” he exclaimed. “That’s going back to the caveman age where men just bred women. And so, progressivism is regressivism.”
The caller also opined that President Donald Trump was like the Vietnam War because “he’s fighting the perception versus the reality.”
As an example, Paul said that “the left, the greens are trying to sell the country that fossil fuels are bad and that we got to go solar and wind.”
“We have to stay with fossil fuels or billions of people are going to die,” the caller insisted. “The freedom of the world, the poor people are tied to cheap energy.”
Paul warned that the U.S. was going to “lose the world” because liberals were against fossil fuels.
“There’s item after item that the Republicans support versus what the left — the progressives, which is actually regressive, see, because they’re pushing us,” Paul remarked.

Fraud trial underway for ex-pharma exec Martin Shkreli,"June 26 (UPI) -- Former pharmaceutical executive and Wall Street investor Martin Shkreli, called by some ""the most hated man in America,"" went on trial Monday for securities fraud.
Jury selection for the 34-year-old's trial started Monday in New York City federal court. Shkreli faces a number of securities fraud charges that stem from activities between 2009 and 2014. Shkreli was arrested by agents of the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2015.
Specifically, prosecutors say, Shkreli violated federal law when he managed two hedge funds during that time and swindled investors.
Among other things, Shkreli is accused of using money from one fund to cover claims in the other, which is illegal. The criminal complaint also says he used money from his pharmaceutical startup, Retrophin, to pay unhappy investors who were threatening to sue.
All told, Shkreli faces eight counts of securities fraud and conspiracy. Five of the counts carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison, and the other three carry a maximum term of five years.
Defense attorneys argue that all of the investors were repaid, and thus Shkreli made reparations to the situation.
Shkreli has been the focus of controversy over the last two years. As CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals in 2015, he generated controversy for increasing the price of the drug Daraprim by 5,000 percent -- from $13 to $750 per pill. The drug is used by AIDS patients as part of a medication cocktail to manage their autoimmune disease.
RELATEDSeptember: Woman backs off $50K offer to punch Shkreli in the face
In April, a judge ruled that Shkreli could be tried separately from his former attorney, who has also been charged in the case.
Shkreli, called ""pharma bro"" by some in news media, has also generated headlines with his activity on social media -- even as defense attorneys have purportedly advised him to remain quiet outside of court.
In early 2016, Shkreli pleaded the Fifth Amendment multiple times during a congressional hearing related to rising drug prices.",United Press International – US,0
US military analysis suggests North Korea launched a 'probable' ICBM,"(CNN)US military analysts believe North Korea's launched a ""probable"" two-stage intercontinental ballistic missile on Tuesday, according to a US official with knowledge of the ongoing post-launch analysis.
The initial analysis by the US indicates the North Koreans launched an intermediate, a single-stage KN-17 missile. The ongoing assessment suggests a second stage booster did ignite and produced 30 seconds of additional flight.
The missile flew over 550 miles before splashing down west of Japan, according to the source.
Trump administration national security, military and diplomatic officials are continuing to hold a series of unexpected July 4 meetings to discuss what options might be needed if it is determined for certain that North Korea conducted an intercontinental ballistic missile test, several administration officials tell CNN.
US military technical experts are now reviewing all data and intelligence gathered by US satellites, aircraft and other systems to determine if North Korea's claim that it fired an intercontinental missile is true. ""The claim is being taken seriously,"" one senior Administration official said.
Top officials at the State Department and the Defense Department are participating in the meeting. If it is determined that an ICBM was launched, the goal is for President Donald Trump to potentially approve a ""measured response,"" one official told CNN. Nothing has been decided, but that response could include sending additional US military assets such as troops, aircraft and ships to increase the US presence in the region. Diplomatic options are also being considered including more sanctions.
If it is determined that an ICBM has been fired, the Pentagon will publicly communicate that all missile defense measures aboard Navy ships in the western Pacific and land-based missiles in Alaska are fully ready, as are missile defense systems in South Korea and Japan. The aim is to send a message to Asian allies and the world that the US stands ready to defend against North Korean aggression.
Trump: US patience with the North Korean regime 'is over'
At this stage the US believes that whatever capability the North Koreans have demonstrated it does not necessarily mean they can immediately launch a working missile that can reach as far as western Alaska. And it's also not clear that the regime has a functioning miniaturized nuclear warhead.
However US military commanders have long said they plan against a worst case scenario. Admiral Harry Harris, head of the US Pacific Command recently said, ""I know there's some debate about the miniaturization advancements made by Pyongyang. But PACOM must be prepared to fight tonight, so I take him at his word. I must assume his claims are true -- I know his aspirations certainly are.""
Defense Secretary James Mattis also recently underscored US military policy when asked by South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham, ""Is it the policy of the Trump administration to deny North Korea the capability of building an ICBM that can hit the American homeland with a nuclear weapon on top?""
Mattis answered simply ""Yes, it is, Sen. Graham.""
As CNN has previously reported, US military commanders have updated options for Trump specifically in anticipation of a North Korean ICBM or underground nuclear test.",CNN – Politics,0
England batting frailty leaves South Africa well on top after second day of second Test at Trent Bridge,"Morne Morkel celebrates the key wicket of Joe RootCredit:GETTY IMAGES
15 July 2017 • 6:51pm
South Africa’s captain Faf Du Plessis called this match a ‘huge test of character’ for his team and they have risen to the challenge to put themselves in a position to level the series.
Their resurgence has left Joe Root facing up to the realities of what it means to be the England Test captain in only his second match after the team’s batting crumbled in a rerun of so many performances of the recent past. England have new leadership, but the same old problems persist.
They capitulated on a pitch offering assistance to the bowlers and failed to show the discipline and patience Test match cricket sometimes requires from players.
Their ultra aggressive, white heat approach cost them badly. Devising a Plan B has to be top of Root’s list.
They batted in one gear, flying along in the outside lane at 100mph but on a pitch seaming and swinging, and against two excellent South Africa fast bowlers, it was a gamble that backfired spectacularly to cost them a 130 run first innings deficit.
Kingpin down: Morne Morkel after taking Root's wicketCredit:GETTY IMAGES
They had been warned. James Anderson’s four wickets for four runs in 16 balls in the morning showed how tricky batting would be but still England attacked. It meant that by the end Anderson was bowling again, his morning’s work wasted. England produced the two stand out individual performances of the day with Anderson’s five for 72 and Root’s 78 off 76 balls but Test cricket requires more than that and South Africa have ground out a team performance that puts them in charge.
Anderson struck once more to take the 15th wicket of the day but South Africa were 205 ahead by the close on 75-1. The highest ever successful run chase at Trent Bridge is 286, and with plenty of time left in the match South Africa today will set up the win they deserve.
Du Plessis’s return from paternity leave has galvanised his team and underlined his unofficial status as the best Test captain in world cricket. With his team 1-0 down in the series he has gone on the front foot. He gambled on batting first on a bowling morning on Friday, cleverly cajoled his bowlers as he sensed English recklessness on Saturday afternoon and used his reviews wisely in contrast to Root on the first day. South Africa dropped catches and lost two wickets to no balls at Lord’s. Du Plessis called the mistakes “non-negotiables”. Here they caught everything and not one bowler overstepped. Orders were followed.
Thin but enough: Cook inside edged it and was caught at the wicketCredit:Sky Sports
At Lord’s South Africa had England 80-4 and let them get away. It cost them the match. This time England were 86-3 and history threatened to repeat itself as Root attacked and lifted his team to 143-3. Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander were bowling superbly but it was different game when they went off as debutant Duane Ollivier looked nervous and struggled to control the swinging Duke ball and Chris Morris was wayward.
After lunch Morkel bowled a wonderful spell of seam and swing bowling and it was high class, captivating Test cricket at its best as Root counter punched for England playing some cracking strokes around the ground as a first innings lead beckoned. All England seemingly had to do was see off Morkel and batting would become easier as the afternoon wore on and South African spirits flagged.
But du Plessis squeezed one more over out of his tired fast bowler who had already bowled six on the spin. Root went hard at the first ball of Morkel’s seventh over looking to play another fizzing drive through the off side but instead the ball moved late and he edged behind. This time England would not get away, and the rest of the innings folded within 22 overs.
But it was downhill from there: James Anderson's five-fer was squandered by his batsmenCredit:Getty
The breakthrough galvanised South Africa’s back up bowlers. Morris found an extra yard of pace and cast off his timidity of the morning, bowling aggressively to pick up three for 38 while left arm spinner Keshav Maharaj used the rough wisely and found turn to take three for 21.
Morkel’s brilliance to left-handers is well known. He puts it down to bowling in the garden at his two brothers, who were left handed. Here Keaton Jennings was in his sights and dismissed with a snorter that lifted and moved late to find the edge. Alastair Cook had already gone, struggling against the clever nip and swing of Philander. He was out caught behind but only after Du Plessis went for a review with the umpire turning down what he thought was an lbw shout. There was a spike on ultra edge and Cook was gone caught behind.
Gary Ballance again did the hard work, moving to 27 and building the foundation of an innings that could save his Test career. But after lunch he played a lazy shot to his first ball, driving loosely to be bowled off his pads. He has made scores of 20, 34 and 27 on his return to the side with two soft dismissals and one unplayable ball. The clock is ticking.
Not a lot of support: captain Root had little help from his colleaguesCredit:Getty
Root was different class. His driving on the front foot pushes back the lengths of bowlers looking to be full so the ball can swing and find the edge. Anything slightly shorter was guided down to third man in controlled fashion and he pulled powerfully as he reached his fifty off 40 balls, the equal fastest ever by an England captain.
England were rattling along at five an over but his partners never suggested permanence. Jonny Bairstow cracked fours but it was a frantic, uncontrolled innings. Ben Stokes, deprived of the strike for five overs, top edged a sweep off the spinner which lifted his confidence and he soon ripped one past Bairstow’s defence to hit the stumps.
Moeen plays one way and it was not suited to this occasion. After driving Morris through the off side on the up, Du Plessis moved himself to square cover. Morris delivered a slower ball and Mooen hit it straight to the South Africa captain as his ploy paid off immediately. Du Plessis then reviewed an lbw next ball that sent Broad on his way and a slog from Liam Dawson summed up England’s innings.
Close: South Africa 75/1 (Elgar 38* Amla 23*) lead by 205
Very enjoyable day. England up against it. Report and reaction to follow.
OVER 22: SA 75/1 (Elgar 38* Amla 23*)
Oh look! It's Liam Dawson. Didn't see you there, Luke. I mean, Liam. Anyway. He bowls an over. Amla's not in the mood for any nonsense and dead-bats it. Maiden and that is the close of play.
OVER 21: SA 75/1 (Elgar 38* Amla 23*)
Stokes to Elgar. Ball spits and cracks Elgar a nasty blow on the inside of the arm. Back elbow. He has the trainer on and takes his time, cannot blame him. England look pretty tired and a bit flat, and not exactly desperate to bowl more. Stokes eventually completes a maiden.
OVER 20: SA 75/1 (Elgar 38* Amla 23*)
Amla ultra cautious in this over. Not getting involved with Moeen at all. Close at 6.30pm.
OVER 19: SA 75/1 (Elgar 38* Amla 23*)
Stokes comes on for a bowl. Not 100% if that was his first captaicny decision or whether Root tipped him the nod. Joe now back on the field of play. Amla well across his crease, struck on the pad! Stokes begs Paul Reiffel. But Root decides against reviewing, and rightly so. This was going down the legside with the angle.
OVER 18: SA 73/1 (Elgar 37* Amla 23*)
Crikey. Amla taking a liking to Ali. Bosh down the ground. Now wallops a full toss for four. That was an absolute pie.
OVER 17: SA 63/1 (Elgar 36* Amla 14*)
Root goes off. Stokes is skipper. He claps vigorously to gee up the troops. Of course he does.
Broad continues. Nice drive Elgar!! Four all the way down the ground.
OVER 16: SA 58/1 (Elgar 32* Amla 14*)
Wood withdrawn. Not his best afternoon. Moeen on. Not afraid to toss one up and into the footmarks. Elgar prepared to take him on. Drives. Four. But Moeen ought not to be disheartened by that.
OVER 15: SA 53/1 (Elgar 28* Amla 13*)
Oh dear, more runs to third man. Four. Elgar's edge beats gully. Broad also too straight again, clipped for four. Elgar the beneficiary.
OVER 14: SA 45/1 (Elgar 20* Amla 13*)
Wood not really getting much going. It's quick, and you cannot fault the effort. But Amla seems to be lining him up with some ease. Guides wide of slip for four. Do they need a third man? Short ball sits up nicely and is spanked for four through the legside.
OVER 13: SA 37/1 (Elgar 20* Amla 5*)
Broad is going to have a dart from the Radcliffe Road End. La musique de la chin? Stuart got Hash hooking in the first dig. Not yet, at least. He only gets one ball at Amla in the over. And no bumper. Couple of squirty edges, singles, and a two to mid on when he gets too straight.
OVER 12: SA 33/1 (Elgar 17* Amla 4*)
Woody not really able to get the ball off the straight and narrow. One off the over.
OVER 11: SA 32/1 (Elgar 16* Amla 4*)
Half a moment of alarm for Hash. Working it away, the ball sticks in the pitch somewhat and he's not a million miles away from offering a return catch. ANOTHER maiden.
OVER 10: SA 32/1 (Elgar 16* Amla 4*)
Quick, accurate, and with a judicious bouncer, this is a better over from Mark Wood. And a maiden to boot.
OVER 9: SA 32/1 (Elgar 16* Amla 4*)
Irresistible force meets etc etc as Amla plays out a maiden from Anderson.
Boycott on TMS. ""England's batsmen lost the game in 4 hours today"". Unless there's a miracle, he's probably right #EngvSA
— The Full Toss (@thefulltoss) July 15, 2017
OVER 8: SA 32/1 (Elgar 16* Amla 4*)
Wood comes on in place of broad. His first ball goes for four. Overpitched. Through the covers. Later in the over, too full again. Well, at least he is giving it a chance to swing.
OVER 7: SA 22/1 (Elgar 6* Amla 4*)
Here comes the main man. It's Hash. Anderson has a man back on the hook for him, and deals Amla a short one. Pulled. Wood doesn't do too brilliantly with the fielding. Four. Amla solid as a rock on the front foot now.
WICKET! Kuhn c Root b Anderson 8
Jury's still very much out on Kuhn at this level, but the verdict on Anderson remains that he is the absolute boy. Perfect ball outside off, does just enough. Kuhn goes for it, edges. Nice low catch from the skipper. FOW 18/1
OVER 6: SA 18/0 (Kuhn 8* Elgar 6*)
Broad giving Elgar a full procto exam here. Squaring him up, getting him prodding. Root badly needs a wicket.
England turns its lonely eyes to Stu.

OVER 5: SA 16/0 (Kuhn 8* Elgar 4*)
England Review on a not out LBW call. Anderson hits Kuhn on the pad. This doesn't look all that good to me. That's going to be safe on height, surely? He's given not out but Root reviews. I'd like to know whether the bowler wanted that or the captain. Kuhn bats out of his crease as it is, and strode forward quite well. Not even an ""umpire's call"" to save Root's face.
Four leg byes, to add ins to inj. A couple of balls later, Kuhn is beaten hook, line and sinker by a perfect nibbler outside off.
OVER 4: SA 10/0 (Kuhn 6* Elgar 4*)
Anderson and Broad both have that look on their face that says ""Why am I out here at 5.05pm working my backside off? I should be having a lie-down and doing the Daily Star crossword"" or whatever it is that Jimmy and Stuart like to do on a Saturday afternoon. If England do not take a wicket with this new ball, then I would say that Joe Root has his first tricky situation as skipper.
Elgar nudges for a couple.
OVER 3: SA 7/0 (Kuhn 5* Elgar 2*)
Anderson starting well to Elgar. Got him poking. The leftie prods one out to cover for a couple.
OVER 2: SA 5/0 (Kuhn 5* Elgar 0*)
Heino with a crazy flash here at a very wide delivery. Broad, operating from the Pavilion End with three slips and a gully, looks disgusted. A maiden.
OVER 1: SA 5/0 (Kuhn 5* Elgar 0*)
Heino Kuhn, in his second Test, will be nervous. Into the side on the back of big runs in the warm-up matches. Failed twice at Lord's but looked more the part here in the first dig before wafting at a wide one.
This will settle him! A legside half-volley first ball. Very generous of Jimmy. Four for that. Pinches the strike last ball.
The players are back out
James Anderson has the ball in his hand. England need a big performance from him, and Stuart Broad. 27 overs to bowl.
England all out for 205; South Africa lead by 130
That is a really super bowling performance from South Africa. Philander and Morkel removed an opener each to leave England 3/2. Joe Root then counterattacked hard against Morris and Olivier. But once Root went for 78, England subsided rapidly. 143/3 has become 205 all out. 14 wickets have fallen on the day so far. Still plenty of overs left this evening.
WICKET! Wood c du Plessis b Morris 6
Chris Morris getting some wheels in this over. Speed gun north of 90mph. But he digs the ball in, and Mark Wood mullers it through midwicket! Shot! Morris growls and then unleashes a nasty bouncer that follows Wood. He does well to get out of the way. Next ball, though, another short one. This time, Wood cannot evade the ball successfully, he's fenced at it, and is caught at third slip. FOW 205/10
OVER 51: ENG 201/9 (Anderson 0* Wood 2*) replying to 335
Maharaj, excellent on a ground that has been a spinner's graveyard in recent years, tossing it up, asking Wood if he wants a piece of him. The Durham man doesn't bite. Just one off the over.

England behind the eight-ball here. Can't see Jimmy and Mark pushing this much beyond the 200.
Jimmy unpacked the reverse sweep in that last over. England might be lucky to get TO 200 at this rate, let alone beyond it. Maharaj chuckles as the great man makes a pig's ear of the shot.
OVER 49: ENG 199/9 (Anderson 0* Wood 0*) replying to 335
Maharaj really has been a gem for Du Plessis today, the flight on his deliveries taking a number of key wickets. Wicket maiden from him as Anderson survives, England still tantalisingly short of 200.
I will hand you over to Alan Tyers for the rest of the day.
Dawson b Maharaj 13 More dip and pace from Maharaj and Dawson sends this one high up into the sky, Amla with all the time in the world to take the catch and leave England with just one wicket remaining. The Proteas are well on top here. FOW 199/9
OVER 48: ENG 199/8 (Dawson 13* Wood 0*) replying to 335
Morris on a hat-trick after getting rid of Ali and Broad bowls a full toss at Wood, easily defended by the new man in.
Broad b Morris 0 Full delivery to start for Broad and has he hit it or not!? South Africa appealing and we will have a review, which clearly shows no bat as Broad goes for a duck. England in real bother now. FOW 199/8
Ali b Morris 18 Change in the field to cover the drive has worked perfectly for Du Plessis and South Africa! Ali chips it straight to the man in place and England lose a key batsman, with Broad the next man in. FOW 199/7
OVER 47: ENG 199/6 (Dawson 13* Ali 18*) replying to 335
After four dots Dawson sweeps Maharaj away towards the rope through fine leg, taking him into double figures. 34 RPS on that last ball from Maharaj as England finish the over on 199.
OVER 46: ENG 195/6 (Dawson 9* Ali 18*) replying to 335
Trio of bouncers for Ali from Morris to test him out, keeping the run rate down. Ali eventually cuts it over the field and drives it towards the outfield, although a sweeper is there to limit him to two.
OVER 45: ENG 193/6 (Dawson 9* Ali 16*) replying to 335
Single for Ali and two for Dawson back up against the spin of Maharaj. Dawson blocking well to ride out the over, showing that he likes this ground.
OVER 44: ENG 190/6 (Dawson 7* Ali 15*) replying to 335
Straight after that big appeal Dawson tucks one away for four - strange to see that given so quickly by the umpire but the appeal from Morris was certainly convincing.
South Africa think they've got Dawson here with an edge... and there is nothing but complete daylight between bat and ball on review from England! Bizarre.
OVER 43: ENG 186/6 (Dawson 3* Ali 15*) replying to 335
And we're back. Given the way this match has played out so far, beware the early wicket.
Ali begins with a single out to cover, Dawson adding one more as England make a steady start against the in-form Maharaj.
South Africa on top
England finish the session on 99/4, the loss of Root on 78 and Bairstow on 45 particularly frustrating for the hosts.
Philander and Morkel set the early tone but the late input of Maharaj has proven to be of huge importance, giving Stokes a frustrating spell out in the middle.
Both sides are now off for tea, and we will be back with you to guide you through the final session shortly.

Big partnership now for England and after three straight scores of 0, Dawson gratefully gets a single to end his run of ducks.
Up to 33 RPS on that last delivery from Maharaj who has done well since he came in. England in trouble.
Bairstow b Maharaj 45 What a beauty that is. Turn from Maharaj and the speed deceives Bairstow, the ball flying on through to clip the top of off stump.

No hanging about from Ali, who dispatches the first ball for four towards deep extra cover. He's certainly loose, which is not exactly what England needed trying to chase down this South Africa lead at a tricky time.
Stokes b Maharaj 0 Not an innings to remember for England's big-hitter facing only 12 deliveries, a feather of an edge back onto his pads flying through to De Kock.
Long review from the third umpire to make sure the ball didn't flick the helmet of De Kock as it bounced up, but Stokes is now walking. Ali into the attack with England in trouble. FOW 168/5
OVER 36: ENG 168/4 (Bairstow 45* Stokes 0*) replying to 335
Stokes is currently able to stand there and plot out an elaborate summer holiday given Bairstow's ongoing retention of the strike.
Hit up and back down the ground by Bairstow - probably more air than he was planning under that but it lands safely, rolling away for four. Du Plessis asking for the ball to be checked and it passes through the umpire's rings with no issues at all, with Bairstow now creeping up on a half century.
OVER 35: ENG 164/4 (Bairstow 41* Stokes 0*) replying to 335
Maharaj's spin brought into the attack by Du Plessis, another mis-field from Philander gifting Bairstow a single to round off an over that looked destined to finish as a maiden.
OVER 34: ENG 163/4 (Bairstow 40* Stokes 0*) replying to 335
Philander displeased unsurprisingly with the outcome of that review, with Bairstow then edging another ball back onto his pads towards the end of the over.
Stokes still yet to get off the strike as Bairstow rounds off an eventful over with an edge rolling through the field, Bavuma needing new studs after he slips twice trying to chase it down.
England as a result get three, with Bairstow moving to 40.
Big appeal from the Proteas for an lbw on Bairstow, which looks promising until Ultraedge reveals there was contact from the bat before it found the pads. South Africa with one appeal left therefore in this innings.

Mis-field from Philander at mid off allows Bairstow a rare boundary, his fifth so far, before he follows it up with a drive through extra cover with Kuhn's valiant dive not enough to stop the ball hitting the rope.

Four for Bairstow before he gets a little fortunate when an inside edge flies clear of the stumps. 150 up for England as Bairstow rounds off the over by cutting a quick single down the leg side after adding two more to his tally.
OVER 31: ENG 144/4 (Bairstow 22* Stokes 0*) replying to 335
Single out to square leg brings Stokes back onto the strike to face Olivier, who keeps the new batsman from getting off the mark with a few more bouncers. Doesn't take much to work out the South African team meeting on Stokes.
OVER 30: ENG 143/4 (Bairstow 21* Stokes 0*) replying to 335
South Africa's 335 looking quite impressive on the basis of England's efforts so far. Two bouncers in a row from Morkel to welcome Stokes to the party.
The new man sees out the over, a wicket maiden for Morkel who deserved that scalp after an industrious spell after lunch.
Root b Morkel 78 Just as Root looked unflappable, South Africa get the big wicket! Edged by Root to De Kock, his innings coming to an end with 78 from 76 balls. FOW 143/4
OVER 29: ENG 143/3 (Bairstow 21* Root 78*) replying to 335
Quickest hundred by an England captain, not that Root is there yet, is Graham Gooch off 95 balls back in 1990. He's started this over on 77 from 74.
Good fielding from Kuhn limits Bairstow to just two, with a wide from Olivier the only other highlight of note from that over.
OVER 28: ENG 139/3 (Bairstow 19* Root 77*) replying to 335
Down the leg side from Morkel and Root doesn't need a second invitation, helping it towards the ropes for boundary number 12.
Morkel's luck running short as the ball misses batsman, off stump and keeper to roll through for four byes.
OVER 27: ENG 130/3 (Bairstow 19* Root 71*) replying to 335
Olivier coming in from the Pavilion End as Root adds a single, then Bairstow retains the strike with two runs from the leg side. Cut through late from Bairstow then through the off side for two more, the ball notably swinging in very late.
Wide ball from Olivier, a rarity for Bairstow since he came in, is then ruthlessly dispatched through cover for four more. A first over to forget then for the new bowler as England add nine.
OVER 26: ENG 121/3 (Bairstow 11* Root 71*) replying to 335
Another ball from Morkel that doesn't bounce as expected, knocking Root on the arm. Batsman recovers with a controlled edge through the slip cordon, Root's 11th boundary so far.
Does his best to add another out at square leg but Olivier eventually cuts that off, limiting Root to two. Followed by a single as England add seven from that over. Olivier coming in for the next over.
OVER 25: ENG 114/3 (Bairstow 11* Root 64*) replying to 335
Cracker from Root, swiveling and dispatching a short enough ball in a hurry through square leg, livening up the crowd in the process. A single then helps him retain the strike.
OVER 24: ENG 107/3 (Bairstow 11* Root 58*) replying to 335
Root's run rate notably dropping right down after lunch, adding just five since the interval. Man out at deep point cuts off a nice shot, limiting Root to a single, as England start to settle.
OVER 23: ENG 106/3 (Bairstow 11* Root 57*) replying to 335
Three for Root from that over, Philander not hanging around with his deliveries. Bairstow not afraid to tough it out and he is doing so thus far.
OVER 22: ENG 103/3 (Bairstow 11* Root 54*) replying to 335
Low roller from Morkel flies past off stump. Pressure on Bairstow for nearly the whole over until he gets an edge through the slip cordon for a boundary. A rarity however in this impressive spell from Morkel and Philander.
OVER 21: ENG 99/3 (Bairstow 7* Root 54*) replying to 335
Bairstow back on strike following a quick single and he instantly knicks one the way of the slips, the ball dropping short of second slip despite plenty of weight behind it.
Bairstow recovers with two off the next ball but this is excellent from Philander, twisting Bairstow in and out. Testing time in the match for England as they take a single to see out the over.
OVER 20: ENG 95/3 (Bairstow 4* Root 53*) replying to 335
Morkel now getting the ball to swing as well, with South Africa currently all over Root and Bairstow. A real beauty flicks through off Root's back pad to De Kock, with Morkel notably bowling a fuller length. Root then manages to get one away down to long leg - just the one run off the over.
OVER 19: ENG 94/3 (Bairstow 4* Root 52*) replying to 335
Some leg byes for Bairstow but he is incredibly lucky there, Philander motoring as the ball flies through off his thigh pad and past De Kock. Bairstow then recovers to flick the ball through square leg to bring up four, his first runs. Good reply from Philander, teasing Bairstow but the England number five resists. Fascinating over that.

Better idea below of where Root was successful prior to lunch in finding the rope off South Africa's seamers.
Hello! Baton safely transferred between Tyers and myself as we settle in for a finely poised afternoon session.
Root's half century in 40 balls has certainly settled England down from that precarious position of 3/2. Better control with the ball from South Africa after a lunchtime refresh however should slow down that run rate.
LUNCH: England 85/2 (Ballance 26* Root 52*) replying to 335
Highly enjoyable session. Vintage James Anderson brilliance - he took four for four - ensured South Africa were bowled out in 34 minutes. The tourists added just 26 runs today.
But it was soon England who were in trouble on a nice day for bowling, losing both openers for spit. At 3/2, the ball was firmly on top, and six wickets had fallen for just 29 runs in the day!
Once the experienced Philander and Morkel came off after five-over spells, it was a different ball game. Change bowlers Morris and Olivier served up far too many hit-me balls. Root and Ballance have hit back with an unbeaten stand of 82 in just 12.5 overs, with 14 boundaries.
Ben Coles will bring you the afternoon session.
OVER 17: ENG 85/2 (Ballance 26* Root 52*) replying to 335
Time for one over before lunch, it's Maharaj. Root whips him for four, his ninth of the innings, and he has raced to (yet another) classy, attacking fifty. Salutes the crowd and the dressing room, and that is lunch.
OVER 16: ENG 80/2 (Ballance 25* Root 48*) replying to 335
Root drives the ball into the ground, and it rebounds for a 'caught and bowled' for Olivier. Given not out on the field but there's an umpire review (not one requested by the fielding side) to see if it was a bump ball. It was.
Olivier tries the short ball, it sits up all friendly like and Root swats it away. Four. Now another short ball, Root takes it on. The ball is in the air a long time before it plugs safely. Two. Ooh! Now Root edges, it runs through the cordon for four.
Mikey Holding on the trials of Duanne Olivier. ""Olivier is not used to bowling in England. His wrist position is not right so the ball is swinging too early. It swings when it is wide but not when it is on the stumps.""

Morris. Ballance. Far too wide, Ballance does well to reach it, carves that away for four over gully. Root fiddles loosely and is beaten.
11 fours between Root and Ballance.
Bumble reckons that South Africa have been ""looking for the magic delivery"" the one that pitches middle and leg and hits off stump/the outside edge. I reckon these bowlers have been seduced by the helpful conditions and are being too ambitious. Just put it outside off stump, and the rest will take care of itself.
OVER 14: ENG 62/2 (Ballance 20* Root 35*) replying to 335
That's the best yet from Olivier, tight to off stump, Root has to play and is beaten! But the next ball is a cheap two down the legside.
Excellent start from Morkel and Philander has been squandered by the change bowlers Morris and Olivier.

Duanne Olivier comes on for a bowl. Decent start, getting a bit of swing, but the last ball of the over is onto Root's pads, and it's soon being fetched from the legside fence. SA squandering what was a potentially match-winning start to the innings with some wayward bowling.
OVER 11: ENG 49/2 (Ballance 17* Root 29*) replying to 335
Change of bowling as Chris Morris comes on, and he has started with a load of old tut. Short, wide, rubbish, spanked for four. And again. Cracked behind square. Two balls to Root, two fours. Deep point saves a third one! This is a rotten start from Chris. Better stuff to the leftie Ballance, but his skipper won't thank Morris for that pressure valve over.
OVER 10: ENG 39/2 (Ballance 16* Root 20*) replying to 335
The South African bowlers take a leaf from England's book as they badger the umpires to change the ball. Nothing doing so far. It fits through the hoop just lovely. Ballance guides said ball through gully for four. England certainly not dawdling; scoring at a good clip.

Three boundaries in the over as Root looks to counterpunch! First one is a glorious cover drive. Now a less convincing shot, flashed through gully. Now a classy backfoot drive through the covers. Three fours.
OVER 7: ENG 14/2 (Ballance 4* Root 7*) replying to 335
Joe has two off the inside edge, a legit single to leg, and now Gary Ballance opens his account with a streaky four through the gully.
South Africa's 335 is looking a very decent, not to say distant, total right about now. As Scyld wrote in today's paper, this won't be a fun pitch to bat last on: it was moist yesterday, and the indentations made by the ball in the pitch will be bumpy and difficult to play.

Vernon has got that away swinger working nicely. Ball utterly dominant this morning, six wickets so far - the same number as in the entire first day!

Two wickets in two balls! Last ball of Vernon's over, first ball of Morkel's. This was a very good cherry from Morne. Round the wicket, straightens, bounces, and there's no disgrace in edging that behind. Absolute snorter to get early on, and Jennings must trudge off with a nine-ball duck. FOW 3/2
That's the second duck of Keaton's young career. England are in a spot of bother with two men back in the hutch for just three runs scored. Ball on top today!

I initially thought that was LBW, but Cook had got a tiny inside edge. Caught at the wicket. Decision had been given as not out but was overturned on review. FOW 3/1
Excellence from Philander. Swinging the ball into Cook as he plops forward and tries to play around the pad. Two of the first three balls clump the inside edge and would have been snaffled by a bat-pad man.
""He's all over Cook here, the captain should give him a man in there. But too many bowlers today are more concerned about not going for runs than taking wickets,"" says Shane Warne.

Magnificent cricket from Jimmy Anderson. Morris drives, trying to work it to leg with a bit too much bottom hand. He gets the leading edge. The bowler parries the ball in front of his face, and then gathers it. FOW 330/9
Scenes as Ben Stokes's trousers fall down!
Morris pushes the ball to cover. Stokes swoops, gathers... and his trousers fall down! This in turn trips him up, and he seems to have done himself an injury in the process. Doctor on to examine his left intercostal area. Goodness me.
OVER 94: SA 326/8 (Morris 32* Morkel 4*)
Good stuff from both batsmen. Morris with a short armed pull, four. And now Morne swings those long arms and biffs the ball down the ground for another boundary.
OVER 93: SA 317/8 (Morris 27* Morkel 0*)
Morne sees out the over. Ideal bowling conditions. Maybe South Africa should just get on with bowling rather than fiddle around for 45 minutes with Morne and number 11 Duanne Olivier not scoring. I'd tell Morris to swing and swing hard.
WICKET! Maharaj c Root b Anderson 0
Classic swing bowling, classic Jimmy Anderson. A big inswinger (so much so that it goes for four leg byes) is followed by the outswinger. It's too good for Maharaj, who pokes unconvincingly. Edged. and a very good catch by Root diving across to his left. FOW 317/8
OVER 92: SA 313/7 (Morris 27* Maharaj 0*)

OVER 91: SA 309/7 (Morris 23* Maharaj 0*)
Anderson was a bit too short in that over, in truth. A bonus wicket. Maharaj is greeted with a nice delivery that beats his bat.
WICKET! Philander c Dawson b Anderson 54
Oh no! Big Vernon tries to turn the ball, short of a length, away to the legside. He's got a leading edge, the ball has popped up to extra cover and that's the easiest catch you'll ever see. FOW 309/7
Philander is glaring meaningfully at the pitch as he trudges off, but I am not sure it misbehaved. Just a poor shot choice.
Well, that was all excellent stuff
But let us turn now to the present day. The players are out on the pitch. James Anderson and Stuart Broad are moaning to the umpire about the ball.
It's a bit chilly, it's blowing, overcast. Lights are on.
It seems that England will be getting their way. A replacement ball is being produced.
They couldn't have done this overnight? Or earlier today?
Anyhow. Here is James Anderson, as South Africa resume on 309/6 in 90.0 overs (Philander 54 Morris 23)
About the challenges of facing a line bowler like Polly, always targeting the off-stump. Pollock also saying about how he changes his length in England (fuller) and wishes that he hadn't had such a long delivery stride. He thinks a shorter stride would have given him a more McGrathian control.

Will Vernon Philander continue to frustrate England?Credit:ACTION IMAGES
explaining how he lines up with the centre of his head on off stump. In South Africa where he struggled a bit, he says, he was standing a foot too wide. And also how he moves his head to follow the line of the ball.
Scyld Berry on SA's fight (good) and shot selection (not so good)
South Africa passed the “test of character” which their restored captain Faf du Plessis said the second Test would be for the tourists. Their traditional grittiness was manifested as they took the first-day honours - by a short head - with 309 for six on a pitch that was damp and difficult at the outset, making it a brave decision by du Plessis to bat first.
South Africa did not pass the more cerebral test of shot-selection quite so well. An individual century would have given them control of this match, as England will have the task of batting fourth on a pitch which is expected to have indentations - arising from the ball’s impact on the surface when it was initially damp - and therefore considerable unevenness. England cannot afford a match, like Lord’s, of four ever-diminishing totals.
Hashim Amla and Quinton de Kock, however, rather gave their wickets away when three figures were in their grasp. If Vernon Philander does not convert his overnight 54 off 76 balls - and England on the second morning might finally decide to try him with bouncers - and if no South African scores a century in their second innings, it will make a run of five Tests without any of their batsmen making a hundred, which is a relatively long sequence in this run-glutted age.
South Africa edge ahead of England on day one but poor shot selection leaves visitors short of full control
Suitably silly warm-up going on
Should't they be playing lacrosse or doing taekwondo or somesuch?
Has stood up for the Proteas with the bat and England will want rid of him without fuss. The stand between VDP and satire's own Chris Morris is already worth 74.
Tyers here, looking forward to bringing you day two of the second Test match between England and South Africa at Trent Bridge.
An excellent summary of the first day's play and situation is provided below, from promising young match reporter Jonny Bairstow. He's summed it up admirably, wouldn't you say?
England are banking on a change of fortune after having to settle for modest rewards on a fluctuating first day against South Africa at Trent Bridge.
Jonny Bairstow believes Stuart Broad and James Anderson might easily have put the tourists in trouble before lunch in the second Test, when cloud cover played its part after Faf du Plessis chose to bat first.
The wicketkeeper confirmed England would have bowled if the choice had been theirs on a morning when they managed just one wicket despite beating the edge regularly.
Hashim Amla (78) rode his luck at times, and it was only after Broad (three for 47) returned to see off the No 3 and his third-wicket partner Quinton de Kock (68) that England began to make progress - before South Africa rallied again to close on 309 for six.
Bairstow reflected on a day which therefore left both sides with their frustrations but hopes too that they are still in comfortably retrievable positions.
""It's pretty even,"" he said. ""Obviously, it could have been quite heavily in their favour if we hadn't got those four wickets in the last session.
""So credit to the way our bowlers bounced back, (but) also credit to the way they applied themselves with the bat.""
England dropped one catch, Amla escaping Alastair Cook's clutches at slip on 56 - although several other edges or mishits did not go to hand, including one from the very last ball of the day when Chris Morris edged Ben Stokes just short of Joe Root.
""I thought we could have done perhaps better, but you're always going to be looking at those little things,"" added Bairstow. ""There were a few that dropped short in the outfield at deep-square, couple that dropped short at slip - even that last ball - and it could be a different game.""",Daily Telegraph,0
Professor Rants About McCain and Those Wishing Him Well: ‘He’s a War Criminal’,"Written by Keely Sharp
San Diego State University professor Jonathan Graubart is causing some controversy after he want on a rant on social media.
Graubart became annoyed with people were were wishing Senator John McCain good health after he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. While he the thorn in our side, he is still a human and wish him good health as well.
Graubart went on to call McCain a, “war criminal.” He said, “I find myself annoyed at the groundswell of good wishes for John McCain after his diagnosis of glioblastoma and have been thinking through why.”
He continued, “McCain is a war criminal and, more to the point, someone who as a politician has championed horrifying actions and been lousy on state commitment to public health,” the professor said. “So dying or not, he’s a risible public figure (I have no idea what he is like on the personal level and don’t care).”
The professor wrapped up the post by saying, “But ultimately what troubles me is the urge to send such well wishes to an utter stranger as it reinforces the notion that some lives are more important than others. There are lots of people with glioblastoma and who have died from it (including my mother 20 years ago).”
TRENDING ON EAGLE RISING
Ben Dillbeck, a student at SDSU, said that he was shocked by the professor’s words. Dillbeck stated, “I would never wish cancer upon my worst enemy and then to be annoyed by people just wishing you the best for having cancer, I just thought it was totally inappropriate.”
Graubart’s Facebook appears to have been deactivated since he posted the status.
The station also interviewed former SDSU student Colby Tunick who read what the professor wrote while in Prague.
“I think I was a little disturbed, to be quite honest,” Tunick told the station, via Skype. “You may disagree with someone politically, morally, philosophically, but you don’t wish someone harm.”
He also said he wasn’t surprised about the post.
“He has told me that he thinks it’s his job as an academic to stir controversy and he normally does that through Facebook,” Tunick said.
But some people defended Graubart, saying he’s entitled to speak his mind. They described him as a man of integrity and intelligence.
The College Republicans of SDSU, a student group, posted a statement on social media Sunday condemning Graubart’s remarks.
The professor called U.S. Sen. John McCain a war criminal and a politician who has championed “horrifying actions and been lousy on state commitment to public health.” (Reuters)
“As an academic authority at SDSU, Dr. Graubart’s sickening lack of respect toward Senator McCain will not be tolerated by our organization and should not be tolerated by university administration,” the statement said.
It is discouraging to see the lack of empathy and respect for human life. I do not like Barack Obama but I would never wish death upon him.

Beauty Queen’s Triggers Outrage When She Visits HIV Orphans – Here’s The ‘Reason’ Why,"Published on July 11, 2017
 
Talk about your lose-lose situation. There are fiery opinions on both sides. Which one are YOU on?
“Beauty Queen Visits Orphanage.”
It was supposed to be a nice photo op. It quickly became a PR nightmare.
She was handing out food to ‘Orphans and children with HIV’.
What was the problem with that? She was wearing gloves.
Either that was an OUTRAGE (for a variety of reasons) or the sensible thing to do, and she would have been insensitive NOT do to so.
See how it’s lose-lose already?
This is the photo they reacted to:
Miss South Africa has sparked fury after she was pictured handing out food to orphans with HIV while wearing gloves.
Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters, 22, also faced allegations of racism from angry people on social media after the images of the charity event in Johannesburg emerged.
But Miss Nel-Peters, who is mixed race, strongly denied these claims and said she wore the gloves for hygiene reasons because she was ‘handling food’.
It came after she was criticised online with people claiming she was afraid to touch children with the disease at the soup kitchen or she was ‘wearing gloves to touch black children’. –Read More
Was the outrage legitimate, or misplaced?
Another wrote: ‘Not convinced you deserve to be Miss South Africa feeding orphans wearing gloves, ayi Shame.’
But in a video message released on Twitter, Miss Nel-Peters said her intentions were misread and she apologised for any offence caused.
She said: ‘I just want to clear something up. All the volunteers on site wore gloves because we were told it was the right thing to do while working with food and we were handing out food to young kids. —
First about the racism claim… she’s mixed, so she should have just as much claim to being black as, say, Obama. It ‘could’ be that, but it’s hard to imagine that’s really the reason.
The second issue was a possible wrong attitude to sick kids.
Is there still a stigma to HIV? It’s halfway around the world in South Africa. Most likely, that’s an issue people are dealing with there, just like some are here.
But that isn’t the only explanation. There’s a far more innocent one, too.
If other volunteers WERE wearing gloves, it would be easily explained away as ‘when in Rome’. She’s the outsider, and it’s expected that should follow everyone else’s lead.
On the other end of the spectrum, can you imagine if she were serving food with ungloved hands? You can be sure someone, somewhere would have complained about her ‘not even wearing gloves while serving food to kids with compromised immune systems’.
It’s sad that helping orphans can devolve into a PR debacle.
What’s the only thing we can be sure of here? She needs to fire her PR people for creating this crisis. And any other people who want to help orphans will either avoid the photo ops altogether or at least avoid handing out food.
She’s not the first Beauty Queen whose political firestorm Clashdaily has reported on. The one who was punished after she tweeted something critical of Islam (and a moronic Liberal) went absolutely viral.",Clash Daily,1

Donald Trump Jr. revealed on Sunday that, in June of 2016, he was lured by an unnamed acquaintance into a meeting with the promise of ""information helpful to the campaign."" According to The New York Times' reporting, the expectation was more specific -- ""damaging information about Hillary Clinton."" When the would-be source, a Russian lawyer, did not produce the goods but instead pivoted to an unrelated diplomatic question, Trump Jr. recalled, the session was quickly abandoned.
The statement also notes that Jared Kushner, the President's son-in-law and a top campaign adviser, and former campaign manager Paul Manafort were in the room, at Trump Jr.'s invitation. If faithfully recalled, it's a remarkable scene -- with the nomination in hand, Trump's top aides stopped their work and, with no knowledge of what was purportedly on the table, gathered for a discussion with a mystery guest.
Despite all the new details to chew on, this is a story that begs still more questions. Here are five.
1. Why did Trump Jr. agree to take a meeting without asking who would be there?
Trump Jr. statement: ""I was asked to have a meeting by an acquaintance I knew from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant with an individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign. I was not told her name prior to the meeting.""
First, consider this: By the time this meeting came together, his father was the presumptive Republican nominee and there was, at the least, suspicion that Hillary Clinton's private email server had been compromised. That established, Trump Jr. took a meeting, with the promise of ""information helpful to the campaign"" without any inquiry into who would be sitting across from him. Really?
We know the Trump campaign survived and even thrived on chaos, but given his position, both in relation to the candidate and within the Trump organization, it seems really, profoundly weird that Trump Jr. would agree to a sit-down under such mysterious circumstances.
Which brings us to a related question...
2. Is it normal for Manafort and Kushner, who were basically running the campaign, to not be told about the purpose of a meeting?
Trump Jr. statement: ""I asked Jared and Paul to attend, but told them nothing of the substance.""
Again, this is June 2016. Trump has cleared the GOP field, but still faces the prospect of a delegate revolt at the July convention. One of Manafort's top tasks, at that point, was steering the ship cleanly into Cleveland. Kushner, as now, was a top adviser to Trump.
And yet they attended this meeting without ever asking about its subject matter? Trump Jr., who asked them to ""stop by"" (as he described it in his statement from a day earlier), never mentioned that the visitor was advertised as arriving with ""information helpful to the campaign""?
3. What would have happened if the lawyer did have something 'of substance'?
Trump Jr. statement: ""It quickly became clear that she had no meaningful information. (The lawyer) then changed subjects and began discussing the adoption of Russian children and mentioned the Magnitsky Act. It became clear to me that this was the true agenda all along and that the claims of potentially helpful information were a pretext for the meeting.""
In his telling, the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, began by peddling a ""vague, ambiguous"" and ultimately unsubstantiated allegation that ""individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton."" At that, Veselnitskaya pivoted to another, more familiar Russian diplomatic concern, and was duly sent on her way.
But what if, as promised, she had brought the goods? What if her Clinton story was believable -- then what?
4. Did Trump Jr. not ask how the ""information"" was obtained, or by whom?
""I was asked to have a meeting by an acquaintance I knew from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant. ... As (the meeting) ended, my acquaintance apologized for taking up our time. ""
Russia hosted the 2013 Miss Universe pageant. Was there any suggestion, then, that this nameless visitor would be a foreigner?
A related, and probably more important point: Was there any discussion, ahead of time, over how he or she had procured the ""helpful"" new details?
Given claims by a Romanian hacker that he had breached Clinton's email, it would seem like a pertinent question. If the promised ""information"" had been obtained through similar means, or by the same person or group, the meeting, and whatever was discussed there, would have placed all the Trump campaign attendees in murky ethical and, perhaps, legal waters.
5. What comes next?
After issuing a brief response for the initial Times story, published on Saturday, Trump Jr. released this second, much more detailed account.
Even if the situation demanded a follow-up, why did he go this deep? (And how, given that, did he leave so much unanswered?) Most importantly, given how much Trump Jr.'s story changed -- or expanded -- over the course of the weekend, how are we supposed to believe there isn't more to tell?",CNN – Politics,0

Trump's tweets on military transgender ban send Pentagon aides scrambling,"| Jul 26, 2017, 1:06 PMShare on TwitterShare on FacebookEmail this articleShare on LinkedIn
President Trump's tweets banning transgender people from serving in the military set off a mad scramble at the Pentagon Wednesday morning, as officials raced to sort out the details after the surprise announcement. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)
President Trump's tweets banning transgender people from serving in the military set off a mad scramble at the Pentagon Wednesday morning, as officials raced to sort out the details after the surprise announcement.
It appeared initially that no one in the building had any idea that the president was unilaterally ending an Obama-era policy, which had allowed transgender troops to serve openly since last year and called for a plan to recruit transgender individuals to serve.
Skittish public affairs officers were afraid to talk to reporters, who pressed for details. Did Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who is on vacation, know about the president's decision before it was announced? Did this mean thousands of transgender troops who were told they could serve openly would now be kicked out?
Asked about rumors that the Pentagon was blindsided about the announcement, one public affairs official told the Washington Examiner, ""I think the reports are pretty accurate that no one knew. I certainly had no idea.""
By midday, Pentagon officials were quietly saying nothing would change until they received official guidance from the White House.
Sources said only a handful of the most senior people were aware of the change, and that only the very highest levels of the Pentagon were consulted. Presumably this meant Trump had spoken to Mattis, but no one could immediately confirm that. Mattis' chief spokeswoman Dana White is also on leave this week.
It fell to Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, the director of press operations, to release a statement, which in its careful wording appeared to confirm the Pentagon was in the dark.
""We refer all questions about the President's statements to the White House,"" Davis said. ""We will continue to work closely with the White House to address the new guidance provided by the Commander-in-Chief on transgender individuals serving the military. We will provide revised guidance to the Department in the near future.""
Some members of the military openly wondered if Trump had confused a new policy being reviewed about accepting new transgender recruits, with the settled policy of allowing troops already in the military to serve openly. Service chiefs were supposed to come up with that new policy by July 1, but a day before the deadline, Mattis gave Pentagon leaders more time.
On Capitol Hill, the announcement also came as a bolt out of the blue.
Neither House nor Senate Armed Services Committees were briefed that the ban was coming, leaving members and staff surprised, according to aides.
Sen. John McCain, the Senate Armed Services chairman, indicated in a statement that he heard about Trump's decision on Twitter and said it was not the proper way to make major policy announcements.
""The President's tweet this morning regarding transgender Americans in the military is yet another example of why major policy announcements should not be made via Twitter,"" McCain said. ""The statement was unclear.""
Trump's policy change was also news to Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who was taking part in a live interview with the Washington Post when the interviewer read Trump's tweet to him.
""I'll give you the same answer that I give in the hallways everyday voting. I don't really respond on a daily basis to tweets that are coming out,"" Corker said.

“Liberals For Bestiality” Create HUMAN LAMB- These People Are DEMENTED!,"Dean James AMERICA’S FREEDOM FIGHTERS –
Government officials in South Africa have moved to calm fears that a deformed lamb resembling a human baby was the result of bestiality and the work of the devil.
No, it’s the work of liberals who practice sexual habits that are completely evil.
Photos of the stillborn lamb went viral on social media this week and it’s plain to see why.
LOOK AT THIS FREAKING BEAST!
Villagers in the Eastern Cape settlement of Lady Frere, approximately 200 miles south of Bloemfontein are HORRIFIED!
LMAO! I don’t blame them! This is insane!
Pictures of the deformed fetus started to circulate on social media, leading many to believe that the photos were a hoax.
But the Eastern Cape Department of Rural Development and Agrarian Reform confirmed the authenticity of the pictures, Fox News reported.
“The elders when they saw it said it was sent by the devil and was born after a coupling between a man and a sheep and then there was panic,” said a villager quoted by The Sun. “Many people are afraid and will not be happy until it is burned.”
However, Dr. Lubabalo Mrwebi, the province’s chief director of veterinary services, said the animal fetus was infected with Rift Valley fever, a viral illness chiefly spread by mosquitoes.
Mrwebi said the animal was likely conceived in December or January, a rainy time of year that would have seen a proliferation of mosquitoes and midges known for spreading Rift Valley Fever.
“We can confirm that this deformed lamb is not a progeny of sheep ovum and a human sperm,” Mrwebi said in a statement, pointing out that sheep ovum and human sperm cannot create a viable life form because their chromosome numbers do not match.
“The deformed lamb exhibits signs that are consistent with an early fetal development that went wrong as a result of a viral infection,” Mrwebi said to timeslive.co.za. “Virus infections in early stages of pregnancy may infect the fetus and lead to the development of malformations in the growing fetus. It is likely that this is what happened to the Lady Frere sheep.”

— Times LIVE (@TimesLIVE) June 21, 2017
Veterinary officials promised to conduct a full postmortem on the animal and reveal its results to the public.
“The lesson we are learning from this experience is that small-stock farmers must keep their animals protected against diseases like the Rift Valley Fever with a correct vaccine‚ which is best given long before the mating season so that by the time the females get pregnant they are already protected against this disease,” Mrwebi said.

"Muslim Worker Finds Out Old White Couple Is Conservative, Gives Them Horrific Parting Gift","July 6, 2017Dom the ConservativeReligion, World News
After discovering that his elderly customers were conservatives, a Muslim migrant left them with a horrific parting gift. (Photos for illustrative purposes: The Evening Times, Judicial Watch)
While working as a grocery deliveryman at a local market, a migrant was always treated respectfully by a pair of elderly customers. However, as soon as he found out that the kind old couple held conservative values, the asylum seeker decided to leave them with a gruesome surprise.
Although the rest of Europe is plagued by Islamic terrorist attacks, many of which are committed by Muslim asylum seekers, Austria has been a relatively safe nation during the refugee crisis. Seeing neighboring countries suffer economic and security issues, Austria refused to welcome in the EU’s quota for unvettable Muslim migrants. Unfortunately, they quickly caved, letting in a whopping 90,000 asylum seekers in 2015, which is still far less than most other European countries. As expected, Austria is now experiencing the labor pangs of migration jihad just like her Western sisters.
Despite giving a Muslim migrant tolerance, respect, and equality, an elderly Austrian couple discovered that one simply cannot supersede Islamic commands with love, no matter how much liberal celebs insist. Although the pensioners were accepting of their Muslim migrant grocery delivery man, the asylum seeker proceeded to butcher the helpless elderly couple because he discovered that they had right-wing beliefs.
The Local reports that a 54-year-old Tunisian Muslim, who remains unnamed, carried out Austria’s first identified jihadist attack after he slit the throat of an 85-year-old woman and stabbed and beat to death her 87-year-old husband on Friday in Linz. Officials confirmed that the migrant knew the couple through delivering their groceries from his wife’s store and that he carried out the attack when he suspected that the elderly couple had links to Austria’s conservative Freedom Party (FPOe).
Rejecting reality, authorities initially refuted all claims that the double-murder was motivated by Islam. However, investigators finally admitted that the man had acted in accordance with the Quran’s commands to slaughter unbelievers wherever they can be found. Austria’s interior minister Wolfgang Sobotka explained that the Tunisian had adhered to his religious beliefs.
The killings “clearly had an Islamist background”, Sobotka told a press conference in Vienna on Wednesday, adding that the 54-year-old suspect, who handed himself in to police, “is clearly a radicalized Muslim”.
The Tunisian first forced his way into the couple’s home before cutting the woman’s throat and stabbing and beating her husband. The woman quickly passed away while her husband was repeatedly stabbed and beaten by the bigoted migrant. Still, while the migrant’s anger was undeniably motivated by his liberal values, his actions were wholly justified by his religious beliefs.
The Quran contains over 100 verses commanding Muslims to enact violence and oppression against non-Muslims. However, there are particular passages that directly order the exact method of slaughter that the Tunisian practiced.
Quran (8:12) – “I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.”
Quran (47:3-4) – “…So, when you meet (fighting Jihad in Allah’s Cause), those who disbelieve smite at their necks till when you have killed and wounded many of them, then bind a bond firmly (on them, i.e. take them as captives)… “
Neither verse contains a hidden peaceful meaning that is being misinterpreted by jihadists. It harbors a literal command that does not merely pertain to times of war, as Allah teaches that Muslims are always at war as long as there’s disbelief in the world. These verses are proactive mandates which the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled violently until his death. In fact, the first of the 2 scriptures was written by Muhammad directly after he ordered his troops to ambush an unsuspecting caravan in order to pillage their goods.
Quran 47:3-4 further explains that the only reason Allah does not wipe out the non-Muslims himself is that he is testing the devoutness of his followers. Those who slaughter unbelievers pass the test and are considered faithful and worthy of the best reward in the afterlife. This passage reserves Allah’s greatest rewards for the jihadists who die while killing non-Muslims, which is why so many Muslims, who may not have priorly lived so religiously, are motivated to become suicide bombers and receive their instant reward. They are instantly atoned once they take out unbelievers with their own “martyrdom.”
As predicted, Islamic migration has come full-circle, proving that every country which opens its borders to Muslims is also welcoming in their religion’s violent commands. Austria is no exception but, hopefully, its officials will come to grips with their first (official) jihadist attack and take the necessary steps to halt the impending Islamization of their country.

"Immediately After Trump Called Out BACKSTABBING Republicans, Paul Ryan Showed The World His True Colors","Speaker of the House Paul Ryan will not be answering President Trump’s call for support.
Just a day after President Trump took to Twitter in an attempt to rally Republicans to step up their reinforcement of his administration, Ryan instead pushed back against the notion that special counsel Robert Mueller is continuing with a biased investigation.
“It’s very sad that Republicans…do very little to protect their president.” Said Trump on Sunday.
But Ryan was quick to make his position clear almost immediately after the President’s call to arms, stating that he doesn’t see an issue with either Mueller’s methods or the fact that Mueller has brought seven attorneys onto his legal team that have donated a combined $60,787 to federal Democratic donors. President Trump himself has dubbed this as “ridiculous”, with with top aide Kellyanne Conway describing Mueller’s legal team as a “band of Democratic donors.”
Ryan, however, told local Wisconsin radio that this simply shouldn’t be considered an issue and “Bob Mueller is a Republican who was appointed by a Republican.” But the House Speaker wasn’t finished, making his most ludicrous comment yet.
“I don’t think many people are saying that Mueller is a biased partisan…he really is anything but.”
As for defending Trump from the investigations, Ryan shows ZERO signs of supporting his President.
“That wasn’t what we were elected to do.”
At this point, I think it’s fair to say Paul Ryan is looking out for Paul Ryan. He has never shown a legitimate commitment to this administration or what is truly best for this nation. Instead, Ryan has set his sights on helping ambitious politicians drag our President’s good name through the mud.
Unfortunately for both Ryan AND Mueller, the truth will not be hidden forever. All they are doing is stopping our President from giving this country his entire attention, and WE cannot let this stand!

"Trump tweets mock video of himself tackling, punching CNN logo","U.S. President Donald Trump speaks at the Celebrate Freedom Rally in Washington, U.S. July 1, 2017.
FILE PHOTO: Republican U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at the Republican U.S. presidential candidates debate sponsored by CNN at the University of Miami in Miami, Florida March 10, 2016.
BRIDGEWATER, N.J. President Donald Trump stepped up his feud with the media on Sunday by tweeting a mock video of himself tackling and repeatedly striking a man with a CNN logo super-imposed in place of his head, followed by a logo saying ""Fraud News Network.""
The video appeared to be a modified version of a 2007 appearance by Trump at World Wrestling Entertainment's WrestleMania 23 promotion, in which Trump ""takes down"" WWE Chairman Vince McMahon. In Sunday's video, McMahon's head has been replaced with the CNN logo.
After Trump appears to beat on the CNN effigy, a logo, ""FNN Fraud News Network"" appears at the bottom of the screen in script similar to that of CNN.
Trump appointed McMahon's wife, Linda McMahon, as the head of the Small Business Administration, a Cabinet-level agency. She was active in the management of WWE for many years.
As a presidential candidate and as commander-in-chief, Trump has repeatedly made known his disdain for the media, calling it ""the enemy of the American people"" and frequently referring to mainstream news organizations as ""failing"" or ""fake news."" He has been particularly scathing of CNN.
The video takes his criticism to a new level and drew criticism from the news organization and on social media.
""It is a sad day when the President of the United States encourages violence against reporters,"" CNN said in a statement.
""Instead of preparing for his overseas trip, his first meeting with Vladimir Putin, dealing with North Korea and working on his health care bill, he is instead involved in juvenile behavior far below the dignity of his office,"" CNN said.
Bill Kristol, the conservative commentator and editor-at-large of The Weekly Standard, compared Trump's actions to behavior that caused the fall of the Roman Empire.
""The speed with which we're recapitulating the decline and fall of Rome is impressive. What took Rome centuries we're achieving in months,"" Kristol wrote in a Tweet.
Trump's Sunday tweet followed his scathing and highly personal Twitter attack on two MSNBC anchors last week, which drew condemnation from Republicans, including Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan, and Democrats alike.
Trump, who is spending a long weekend at his property in Bedminster, New Jersey, took to Twitter on Saturday to call the media ""fake"" and ""fraudulent.""
At an event honoring veterans at the Kennedy Center in Washington on Saturday, he told the crowd that the media had tried to stop him from coming to the White House.
""But I'm president, and they're not,"" he said.

Democrat STOOGE Eric Holder gets REAMED after Attacking Trump,"Eric Holder, Obama’s stooge and toady, has been popping his head out of the gutter to take potshots at President Trump a lot lately.
It seems Holder thinks he has something to gain by this, many have speculated he’s eyeing a Presidential run in 2020, but regardless of his motives, he’s succeeding in doing nothing but highlighting the pathetic nature of the Democrats.
Holder, who experienced failure after failure as Obama’s crony, has a lot of nerve talking about the “integrity” of Robert Mueller, a man who’s blatant bias against Trump is practically tangible.
Rather than attempting to show an ounce of dignity or decency, Holder’s anti-Trump rhetoric has gotten increasingly vicious in recent months, as he relentlessly stirs the pot and attacks our president.
This man has absolutely no room to criticize President Trump, as his “master” Obama disgraced American day after day, while sycophants like Holder enabled him and contributed to the mess our country is in now.
Holder thought he would get more support for his crybaby rant on Twitter, but it did not go as planned…
There is NO basis to question the integrity of Mueller or those serving with him in the special counsel’s office. And no conflicts either

Maybe the dumbass should learn to keep his mouth shut, stay off Twitter, and stop attacking President Trump, because America never had any respect for him to begin with, now we flat out hate him.

The Three Muslim Brothers Who Were Caught Spying Were Hired By Obama Administration,"June 27, 2017Alex D.13 Views 1 CommentMuslim, Muslim Migrant
It’s scary to even think that the man who was supposed to make our country better has been working to bring America down for eight years!
That is why there is no need to be surprised that the terrorism took a swing during Obama’s tenure in the White House.
Reporter Maria Bartiromo recently uncovered a spy ring of three Muslim brothers who were working for Obama’s Democrats in Congress.
I am sure you heard about the 3 Muslim brothers Abid, Imran, and Jamal Awan that were accessing computers without the authority to do so, and may have seen classified information.
These three men were overpaid, getting at least $160,000 and one of them had a criminal background. Yet, Obama hired them.
How is it possible that 3 brothers are hired, Muslim brothers…just saying, to work in Congress and deal with our most intelligent and sensitive information, number one?
They were all making $160,000! Why were they paid so much? 22 years old…one of the guys, the other was 25. They’re making $160,000, $161,000 and $165,000. And one of them has a criminal background!”

Sessions learns loyalty can be a one-way street with Trump,"(Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)
Nothing is more important to President Trump than loyalty — to him.
In business and in politics, he has demanded it from the people closest to him. Some employees who abandoned him were never welcomed back. Politicians who did not defend him after the most politically damaging moments of the 2016 campaign are still suspect in his eyes. And after six months as president, Trump is still known to publicly jab at people who did not support his presidential bid.
But as Attorney General Jeff Sessions learned this week, the loyalty Trump expects isn’t always reciprocated.
Sessions was one of Trump’s earliest supporters in Congress and one of the intellectual god­fathers of the nationalist movement that propelled his candidacy. Sessions lent his support, and even his closest aides, to boosting Trump’s core campaign promises on immigration and terrorism. At a time when Trump had no allies in the Senate, Sessions voiced support for Trump’s “movement.”
But the attorney general’s decision in March to recuse himself from the investigation of Russian interference in last year’s election and possible collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign seems to have made that history irrelevant.
(Taylor Turner/The Washington Post)
Trump unleashed his long-simmering fury at Sessions in an interview with the New York Times on Tuesday, calling Sessions’s decision “unfair” and expressing regret about choosing him as attorney general.
“How do you take a job and then recuse yourself?” Trump said. “If he would have recused himself before the job, I would have said, ‘Thanks, Jeff, but I can’t, you know, I’m not going to take you.’ ”
In Trump’s view, the recusal only served to increase the intensity of the Russia investigation, which the president calls a “witch hunt,” by leading to the appointment of a special counsel.
On Thursday morning, as he tried to highlight a successful drug operation during a news conference at the Justice Department, Sessions faced only questions about whether he would step down in the face of Trump’s public criticism.
The episode seems to vividly capture a Trump trait that is familiar to many of his aides, including chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, White House press secretary Sean Spicer and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus — all of whom have at one time fallen out of Trump’s good graces.
In business and in politics, people who do not measure up might be at risk of losing their jobs, no matter how loyal they have been to Trump. Those closest to him have come to accept this as a reality of his leadership style. Some even remain loyal to Trump after being discarded, knowing he may call on them again in the future.
“Here’s the deal: If you’re doing a good job, he’s not going to fire you,” said former aide Sam Nunberg, who was at one time fired by Trump. Nunberg, who began working for Trump in 2011, calls him a “great manager” despite Trump’s decision to sue him for $10 million in 2016 after their falling-out.
President Trump listens as Attorney General Jeff Sessions speaks during a swearing-in ceremony in the Oval Office in February. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)
Nunberg’s experience is not unique. Trump fired Corey Lew­andowski as his campaign manager after Lewandowski was accused of roughing up a female reporter on the campaign trail and Trump’s children grew disenchanted with his stewardship of the election effort. But Lewandowski has remained a vocal surrogate, phone pal and outside adviser to the president.
The White House is dominated by the uncertainty of Trump’s loyalty to and feelings about his aides and Cabinet secretaries. His spokespeople are repeatedly questioned about whether the president still has confidence in his top advisers, even his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Early in his presidency, Trump surveyed his friends and associates about Priebus’s performance, and rumors that the chief of staff might be replaced have been an ever-present feature of the first six months of the administration.
Bannon, who, like Sessions, helped hone Trump’s ideology during the campaign and entered the White House as one of its most powerful figures, recently found himself flying too close to the sun and risked Trump’s disapproval.
“I like Steve, but you have to remember he was not involved in my campaign until very late,” Trump told a New York Post reporter in April. “I had already beaten all the senators and all the governors, and I didn’t know Steve.
“I’m my own strategist,” the president added.
Like many things about Trump’s foray into politics, his redefinition of loyalty is a striking change from recent presidents.
“It’s different,” remarked Ari Fleischer, who was press secretary for President George W. Bush. “It’s not how they describe personnel management in business school, but it’s also something that I suspect his top people got used to.
“I personally would never fit in an environment like this, but there’s more than one style that can be made to work, even if it makes things harder — and I do think this makes things harder,” he added.
For those in Trump’s orbit, this kind of loyalty has always been in his manual for success.
In “Trump Revealed,” a biography written by Washington Post reporters, a former employee recalled a seminal incident in the early 1990s when the opening week of Trump’s Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City teetered on the brink of disaster. Trump was eager to look around for blame, promising to fire any employees who contributed to the failure. He even sought to blame the casino’s problems on the staff connected to a Trump deputy who had recently died in a helicopter crash.
Trump has acknowledged that his willingness to prioritize his success and well-being over that of other people close to him is a feature of his leadership style.
In his 2005 book, “Think Like a Billionaire,” Trump compared himself to wealthy business executives such as Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and Turner Broadcasting founder Ted Turner, whom he characterized as “successful in part because they are narcissists who devote their talent with unrelenting focus to achieving their dreams, even if it’s sometimes at the expense of those around them.”
To make the comparison, Trump drew on the work of psycho­analyst Michael Maccoby, who wrote the book “The Productive Narcissist.”
In an interview Thursday, Maccoby said that Trump’s focus on one-way loyalty is common in politics, but it is also common among the narcissistic personalities that Trump identified in “Think Like a Billionaire.”
“The problem is that there’s no mutual loyalty,” Maccoby said. Trump’s relationships “can be extremely close, but you never know whether he’ll change his mind.”
“The only people that he remains loyal to are his actual family,” he added.",Washington Post – Politics,0
Trump in Paris with Russia scandal in tow,"Paris – France rolled out the red carpet to welcome Donald Trump on Thursday on a presidential visit laden with military pomp that the White House hopes will offer respite from a growing scandal back home.
The US president’s brief 24-hour trip to the French capital coincides with celebrations for Bastille Day, France’s national day which is marked on Friday, and the 100th anniversary of US involvement in World War I.
Accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump, the 71-year-old stepped onto French soil for the first time as president hoping the visit will distract from weighty allegations that his family and inner circle colluded with Russia to win the 2016 US election.
The scandal has put his son and top aides in legal jeopardy, cast a pall over his efforts to remake the political agenda and may yet imperil his presidency.
During the brief visit, Trump — who sees himself as a transformative figure in US history — will be the guest of honour for Friday’s Bastille Day festivities that mark a pivotal point in the French Revolution.

FIRED: What Trump Just Said About Sessions Is Career Ending…This is HUGE,"In the midst of a drawn out investigation, Jeff Sessions recused himself immediately after being picked as President Trump’s attorney general. In an interview with The New York Times on Wednesday, Trump told the country EXACTLY how he felt about that…and it’s BAD news for Sessions.
Trump wishes he had NEVER hired Jeff Sessions in the first place!
Trump stated to the New York Times,
“Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else.”
Trump then went on to say something that made so much sense it hurt.
“How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused himself before the job, I would have said ‘thanks, Jeff, but I’m not going to take you,” he went on. “It’s extremely unfair to the president.”
Trump got absolutely ZERO warning that Jess Sessions was going to recuse himself immediately. If this isn’t a political back stab by Jeff Sessions then I don’t know what is.
We all should have our President’s back unlike Mr. Sessions! If you agree, get the word out and share it!",Liberty Writers,1

* Tillerson traveled to Doha on Tuesday in hopes of brokering a resolution in the dispute between Qatar and its Arab neighbors
Washington (CNN)The US and Qatar signed a memorandum of understanding that outlines future efforts Qatar can take to ""fortify its fight against terrorism and actively address terrorism funding issues,"" a senior adviser to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced on Tuesday.
R.C. Hammond called the move ""a hopeful step forward"" in resolving the month-long diplomatic crisis in the Middle East.
Tillerson traveled to Doha on Tuesday in hopes of brokering a resolution in the dispute between Qatar and its Arab neighbors.
""I'm hopeful we can make some progress to bring this to a point of resolution,"" Tillerson said during a joint news conference with Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed al-Thani.
Tillerson finally takes center stage at Putin meeting
""I think Qatar has been quite clear in its positions and I think very reasonable and we want to talk now how do we take things forward and that's my purpose in coming,"" he said.
Tillerson will also travel to Saudi Arabia this week as part of his trip through the region. On Monday, he met with officials in Turkey -- allied with Qatar in the dispute -- and Kuwait, which is playing a mediator role.

He also met with Kuwait's acting Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Sabah as well as British National Security Adviser Mark Sedwill in Kuwait Monday. The three countries issued a joint statement expressing concern and calling for a rapid end to the crisis through dialogue, according to Kuwait state media.
According to Hammond, a State Department spokesman, the purpose of Tillerson's trip was ""to explore the art of the possible of where a resolution can be found,"" and the US was ""looking for areas of common ground where a resolution can stand.""
""We've had one round of exchanges and dialogue and didn't advance the ball,"" Hammond told reporters on Monday. ""We will work with Kuwait and see if we can hash out a different strategy. ... This is a two-way street. There are no clean hands.""
President Donald Trump also spoke last week to the leaders of Qatar, the UAE and Saudi Arabia.
When the Gulf countries first cut ties with Qatar, however, Trump appeared to support the Gulf countries cutting ties with Qatar, saying that Doha had to stop funding terrorism. Trump's comments came following his visit to Saudi Arabia on his first foreign trip as president, and contradicted his secretary of state.

"Liberals Explode As Poland’s First Lady ‘Rejects’ Trump, Conveniently Leave Out 1 Detail","July 7, 2017JodiPolitics, World News
The Handshake Heard Round The World: Polish First Lady Agata Kornhauser-Duda supposedly “rejects” President Donald Trump, but there’s more than initially meets the eye.
President Donald Trump arrived in Poland on Wednesday night ahead of the G20 Summit in Germany, which begins on Friday, but he wasn’t even in the country 24 hours before controversy began brewing. Liberals are currently exploding over a video of Poland’s first lady allegedly “rejecting” a handshake from Trump, but as per the usual, they have conveniently left out one detail that changes everything.
According to NBC News, Trump kicked off his second foreign trip this week, descending onto a red carpet with First Lady Melania Trump. They were followed by senior advisers Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, among others.
Trump and his entourage were greeted by U.S. Ambassador to Poland Paul Jones and his wife, as well as Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Witold Waszczykowski and Minister of State Krzysktof Szczerski, before loading into their motorcade.
The next day, they met with the Polish president and his wife, where a video was recorded that is currently making the rounds on social media, with liberals laughing in delight.
Users on Twitter are going crazy over a video depicting the wife of Polish President Andrzej Duda, Agata Kornhauser-Duda, allegedly stiffing President Donald Trump’s offer to shake hands.
The tweet simply says “LEGEND,” and shows a two-second clip.
It has received over 13,000 shares and over 20,000 likes. [Source: Sarah Palin]

Oh, give me a break, people! What you don’t see in the clip is that just two seconds after shaking Melania’s hand, Agata turns to President Trump, offering him a warm greeting, as well.
How convenient for this to have been left out of the footage being passed around Twitter, right?
Footage appears to show Trump extending his hand to Kornhauser-Duda, a high school teacher, who walks straight past it to greet his wife, Melania Trump.
After greeting the US first lady, Kornhauser-Duda then turns to shake his hand.
While some have presented the event as a snub, it seems equally likely Kornhauser-Duda simply did not see the US president’s hand extended to her. [Source: The Sydney Morning Herald]
If you haven’t learned by now, you simply cannot trust the left to present the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. They’ve now taken to editing videos to paint Trump in a negative light because he’s doing such a fantastic job that they can’t use the actual unedited footage to make him look bad.
Either these misguided leftists have entirely too much time on their hands or an obsession with the president that is unhealthy at this point. Perhaps, it’s a bit of both.

Starbucks CEO Opens Shops Especially For Muslims…SPEECHLESS Over Devastating Result [VIDEO],"Starbucks is reaping the results of their hypocrisy. Thanks to former CEO Howard Schultz, the global coffeehouse giant is getting its coffee butt beat. How is that possible?
Schultz thought he was being progressive by pushing for both supporting Muslims and the LGBT community. Guess what? It doesn’t work. Especially when one group detests the other group.
The former Starbucks head tried to establish a new culture by offering Starbucks in Saudi Arabia to be “men only” in selling and service. Schultz also tried to provide Starbucks that were hiring only Muslim refugees.
Heavy Muslim countries like Indonesia and Malaysia said no thank you. These nations pushed for a boycott because of Starbucks support of the gay community.
Amini Amir Abdullah, the head of Malaysian Perkasa’s Islamic affairs bureau, spoke to the boycott according to Daily Mail.
“Our objection is because they are promoting something that is against the human instinct, against human behaviour and against religion. That’s why we are against it,”
Pretty cut and dry
This response by the Muslim groups definitely surprised Schultz. He has carried an agenda as CEO of discriminating against anyone that held Christian beliefs. He even went so far as to tell believers of Jehovah they could stay out of his coffeehouses.
Guess when you try to bite the hand of God, you face some dire consequences. Unfortunately, Schultz’s attitude and actions are coming back to haunt the company and the new CEO Kevin Johnson.
Well, Howard, it seems your anti-conservative attitude has not gone well for you. You sure made a mess for your replacement. But like a good liberal, you do not care what happens to someone else for your mistakes. Sounds like a prior president doesn’t it?
The history and today
Schultz may not have realized just how his pro-gay stance would go over with Muslim tenets of faith. A past video clip illustrated his anti-Christian stand and support for the LGBT. However, Muslims find the LGBT lifestyle to be offensive and worthy of death. He backed a group that hates the people that live the gay lifestyle and actually puts them to death for it. Whereas Christians, who are called to love eveyone even while disagreeing with their lifestyle, are denounced by Schultz as being “intolerant” . Ironic isn’t it.
Here’s what happens in Muslim countries when a woman tries to go order a coffee:

Robert Mueller is now the ninth person in Donald Trump Jr.'s Russia meeting,"Donald Trump Jr., right, watches his father leave the stage on the night of the Iowa caucuses in Des Moines. (Jim Bourg/Reuters)
We have the identity of the “eighth person” in Donald Trump Jr.'s Russia meeting. The Post's Rosalind S. Helderman reports that it's Ike Kaveladze, an American-based employee of a Russian real estate company. According to his lawyer, Kaveladze planned to serve in the June 2016 meeting as an interpreter and the representative of Emin and Aras Agalarov, the Russian pop star and developer who hosted President Trump's 2013 Miss Universe pageant.
It's not clear how the presence of Kaveladze, a U.S. citizen, might change perceptions of the meeting, for which Trump Jr. was promised opposition research about Democrats courtesy of the Russian government. But the big takeaway here is this: The meeting is now under investigation.
Kaveladze's lawyer, Scott Balber, told Helderman that he received a phone call over the weekend from special counsel Robert Mueller's office seeking an interview with Kaveladze. That means Mueller is now looking into the meeting, and it's the first on-the-record indication that he is.
That may not be terribly surprising, given Mueller's investigation is examining coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, which makes this meeting a logical thing for him to look at. Indeed, it would be odd if he didn't. But we now have confirmation.
In addition to possible coordination, the president himself is being looked into for possible obstruction of justice. And the finances and business dealings of his son-in-law and senior White House adviser, Jared Kushner, are also being probed as part of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Despite Trump Jr.'s claims of transparency in releasing his emails arranging the meeting, we continue to learn new things about it — specifically the presence of three people he didn't disclose. First it was Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist and former Soviet counterintelligence officer. Now we have learned the identities of Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya's translator and Kaveladze.
Mueller probing the meeting would suggest, despite Trump Jr.'s opacity, that we would now hear more about it — at least eventually — including perhaps most notably what was in that folder that Akhmetshin said Veselnitskaya provided to the Trump campaign. We'd also likely hear more about specifically who these people are and how substantial their alleged ties to the Russian government are.
That's the scoop, but the bigger news in here is that Mueller is already investigating the meeting. Expected but important. https://t.co/qr2w061qtx
— Matthew Miller (@matthewamiller) July 18, 2017
Where this will wind up, who knows? But we're now in a situation in which the president, his most trusted adviser/daughter's husband and his own son who is running his business are all in Mueller's sights. That is troubling for the president because distancing himself from his family is going to be very difficult.

Watch Tucker Carlson Make Maxine Waters Swallow Her Own Lies On Live TV,"If you follow current events at all, you’ve probably noticed a spike in appearance by an aging Representative from California named Maxine Waters. We have no idea how she won her congressional campaign, but she’s rocketed herself into the national spotlight with a completely absurd campaign to impeach President Trump.
We’ve yet to be given a great reason for why Waters wants to remove the President, but she’s dead set against him. She’s been a frequent flyer on MSNBC, and she even got some air time on Fox recently when she made some less than flattering comments about Fox New’s Tucker Carlson.
Waters, speaking to MSNBC host Joy Reid, was responding to a recent discussion Carlson had on his show when he discussed with Larry Elder a report that said Waters was considering running for the White House in 2020.
Ahead of a speech in New Hampshire this weekend — ironically, also the state with the first presidential primary — Waters told the Daily Caller that she would run for the White House if millennials “want” her to.
“I’m just going up to do a county Democratic thing. That’s all,” Waters told the Daily Caller. “I’m not running for anything but my own seat. I don’t have any presidential aspirations. If the millennials want me to do it, I’d do it, though.”
It sounds to me like Carlson commented on the news that was floating around (ya know, like he’s paid to do) and Waters took it as a cheap shot. One would think that these talks about her running in 2020 would be flattering to the Congresswoman who’s been ripping off her little district for three decades running. But no, as per the liberal oath, she must be offended if any offense can be possibly perceived.
The only reasonable explanation to the rest of the world is that the left is letting this crazy lady say what they’re afraid to say in order to try and make President Trump look bad. Waters has proved that she will do anything at all to get the President impeached, no matter the moral or ethical ramifications, and that’s just what the left has been looking for. After years of haphazard service and single vote usefulness, the left has finally found a use for this career politician, and they’re just milking it.
No, we don’t think that she’ll get the Democratic nomination, even if she runs because that’s not her purpose. Her purpose is to keep squawking about President Trump and Russia while the left comes up with something more reasonable to pin on him. And she’s very good at her job.","Yes, I’m Right",1

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration should review the safety and effectiveness of all opioids, and consider the real-world impacts the powerful painkillers have, not only on patients, but also on families, crime and the demand for heroin.
That's the conclusion of a sweeping report Thursday from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. It urges the FDA to bolster a public health approach that already has resulted in one painkiller being pulled from the market. Last week, the maker of opioid painkiller Opana ER withdrew its drug at the FDA's request following a 2015 outbreak of HIV and hepatitis C in southern Indiana linked to sharing needles to inject the pills.
""Our recommendation is for a much more systematic approach, integrating public health decision-making into all aspects of opioid review and approval,"" said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim of Harvard Medical School, a member of the report committee. ""It would be an ambitious undertaking.""
The report details how two intertwining epidemics — prescription painkillers and heroin — led to the worst addiction crisis in U.S. history and provides a plan for turning back the tide of overdose deaths.
Prescribed, legal drugs are a gateway to illicit drugs for some, the report says. Other users start with pills diverted to the black market. Crush-resistant pills and other restrictions can have unintended consequences, shifting use to heroin and illicit fentanyl.
The epidemic's broad reach into rural and suburban America ""has blurred the formerly distinct social boundary between use of prescribed opioids and use of heroin and other illegally manufactured ones,"" the report says.
The authors say it's possible to stem the crisis without denying opioids to patients whose doctors prescribe them responsibly. But long-term use of opioids by people with chronic pain should be discouraged because it increases dangers of overdose and addiction.
Requested by the FDA last year under the Obama administration, the report was greeted by FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a Trump appointee. Gottlieb said in a statement that the opioid epidemic is his ""highest immediate priority"" and he ""was encouraged to see that many of (the) recommendations for the FDA are in areas where we've already made new commitments.""
Still, no immediate review of opioids as a class of drugs is planned by the FDA, other than the agency's routine safety surveillance. Gottlieb said the FDA re-evaluates the safety of approved drugs with post-market information required from drugmakers and other sources.
""We will continue to consider what additional information is needed to ensure we have the right data to make important, science-based decisions,"" he said.
Beyond the FDA, the report recommends:
—Better access to treatment for opioid addiction, including use of medications such as buprenorphine, in settings including hospitals, prisons and treatment programs. (The revised Senate Republican health care bill released Thursday includes $45 billion for states to use for addiction treatment and other responses to the opioid crisis, a boost over the $2 billion in the initial bill.)
—Year-round programs that allow people to return unused opioids to any pharmacy at any time, rather than only at occasional events. Some pharmacies, including Walgreens, have installed kiosks where people can get rid of pills.
—Insurers pay for pain control that goes beyond opioids to include non-drug treatment. The report doesn't specify which treatments insurers should cover, but does outline what early evidence exists for acupuncture, physical therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy and mindfulness meditation, calling them ""powerful tools.""
—More research on the nature of pain and dependency on opioids and development of new non-addictive treatments.

China opens up $10 trillion bond market in liberalisation step,"Shanghai – China on Monday opened up its $10 trillion bond market to foreign investors, in the latest liberalisation move by Beijing as it seeks to draw in more fund flows as it battles slowing economic growth.
The new conduit comes via Hong Kong, where “qualified investors” will be able to buy debt in China — the world’s third-largest bond market after the United States and Japan.
Qualified investors include central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and other major financial institutions, according to the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, who jointly announced the platform on Sunday.
Their statement said the “bond connect” arrangement between the Hong Kong and mainland Chinese markets went into “experimental operation” from Monday.

Why the latest wave of terrorism will get worse before it gets better,"The latest attacks in London and Manchester – like last year’s attacks in Orlando, Florida and St. Cloud, Minnesota – epitomize what I call the newest form of terrorism.
The newest terrorists aim to kill as many people as possible, as frequently as possible, as horrifically as possible, intimately, suicidally, with the most accessible weapons, in the most accessible public spaces.
Defining what terrorism is can be contentious but over the years scholars have identified several distinct waves. The “old” wave of terrorism from the 1960s was largely secular, aiming for political representation, ideological change and separatism.
In the 1990s, a group of scholars identified the rise of what they dubbed “new terrorism.” New terrorists, these scholars argued, tend to be religiously motivated – and, because religious terrorists are usually more interested in killing outsiders than causing political change, they tend to be more lethal.
Although the term “new” refers to religious terrorism more than recent terrorism, terrorism emerged as predominately religious in the 2000s. While this term has its critics, our research shows it is a distinct category that is getting riskier.
Now, more than 20 years since new terrorism was identified, my colleagues W. James Stewart, Aarefah Mosavi and I at the University of California Berkeley have analyzed what we term the “newest terrorism.” Our forthcoming book, “Countering New(est) Terrorism,” offers the first big data analysis of new/religious versus old/secular-political terrorism.
While the new terrorists prioritized spectacular lethality in long-planned hijackings or bombings of mass transit, offices or hotels, the “newest” terrorists encourage more frequent active violence, hostage-takings and kidnappings. They seek to kill in the most horrifying ways. They distribute acts of violence widely in time and space. They do not just wait for an infrequent spectacular attack like 9/11.
That means the aggregate lethality and economic costs are increasing, even though the average lethality per attack is decreasing.
The characteristics of religious terrorism become trends among terrorists in general, as secular terrorists shift to the latest technologies, methods and even intents. For instance, in February 2013, a Marxist Kurdish separatist group carried out its first suicide bombing - on the U.S. Embassy in Turkey.
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is a federally sponsored, freely available dataset that covers both international and domestic terrorist events. It includes more than 150,000 incidents from more than 200 countries and territories, for the years from 1970 through 2015.
For each of 8,294 hostage crises from 1970 through 2015 and all 80,676 terrorist events from 2004 through 2015, we coded the perpetrators as either religious or secular terrorists. Religious terrorism includes not only Islamist terrorists, but terrorists motivated by any religion, such as Hindu and Christian fundamentalists. This gave us more than five million data points.
Terrorism is very infrequent compared to other crimes and natural disasters. But the risk of terrorism is greater, because of the colossal social and economic costs. So the fashionable observation that other crimes kill more people ignores terrorism’s wider harms, not least the terror itself.
The GTD shows that the risk of terrorism has increased dramatically over the long term, most acutely in the last couple decades, as religious terrorism became predominant globally, and most harmful, even in countries such as the U.S., where religious terrorism is not predominant in frequency. Risk is usually calculated according to the frequency of attacks and their negative effects. By both of these measures, religious terrorists represent a greater risk than secular terrorists. We found that they attack more frequently and kill more people on average per attack and in aggregate. This is true even in countries such as the U.S., where most terrorism is not religious.
In the early 2000s, terrorist attacks worldwide remained steady at about 1,000 per year, although average lethality was increasing. In 2005, attacks began to rise dramatically, increasing over the next decade by more than 15 times in frequency and more than nine times in lethality, with around 40,000 total deaths from terrorism in 2015.
How terrorism is changing
Terrorist ideologies are becoming more religiously extreme. This is associated with more murderousness, more willingness to die and more intransigence.
Their objectives – such as destroying Israel or “conquer(ing) your Rome, break(ing) your crosses, and enslav(ing) your women,” – are unacceptable for the rest of us.
Religious terrorists are more resistant to compromise. For instance, according to our calculations, over 46 years of data, hostages taken by religious terrorists were released only 31 percent of the time. When secular terrorists took hostages, they released the hostages 51 percent of the time.
We also found that these religiously motivated terrorists are more lethal fighters than old terrorists and are more willing to kill. Twice as many people die during religious terrorist hostage-takings than political terrorist hostage-takings. (The dataset does not distinguish the causes of these deaths.) They tend to kill more people, even though they deploy fewer hostage-takers per event and per hostage.
Religious terrorists are also more willing to die to maximize the harm to their targets. More than twice as many religious terrorists as political terrorists die per hostage-taking event. Moreover, almost all the terrorists who commit suicide during an attack are religious terrorists.
The newest generation of terrorists are competing with each other to raise the horror. This includes, unfortunately, lengthening publicity before mass killings, such as the followers of the Islamic State in Bangladesh, who took hostages just to release film of themselves killing 21 of them.
As part of this interest in increased horror, new terrorists are more drawn to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons. For instance, from 2014 through 2016, IS used chemical weapons at least 52 times in Iraq and Syria (mostly chlorine and sulfur mustard agents). They also encourage wider use of uncontrolled weapons – such as knives and automobiles – rather than more lethal weapons that would draw official attention.
Increasing urbanization and growing population sizes provide readier targets. We found that newest terrorists choose more public targets, such as theaters and shopping malls, theoretically in pursuit of higher lethality and terror. Old terrorists choose more politically useful or symbolic targets, such as government buildings or military barracks.
Thanks to easier access to information, new terrorists are more informed about their opposition’s policies, tactics, techniques and procedures. They have access to better surveillance technologies, such as for mapping targets.
What’s more, terrorists use open borders, easier travel and communication technologies. For instance, the Manchester bomber traveled regularly to Libya for conferences with extremists and eventually terrorists from the Islamic State.
Finally, there is the fact that these newest terrorist use information and communication technologies to communicate with the public directly. These technologies are even used to attract targets to the site of the attack.
Our findings suggest that terrorism will get much worse before it gets better.

Russia may implement further retaliatory measures to “bring US to its senses”,"Adam Garrie15 hours agoJuly 28, 2017 1,215
Russia is delivering a strong message.
Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has said that today’s retaliatory measures by Russia against the United States may only be the beginning if the US moves ahead with sanctions.
Earlier today, Russia cut of American access to storage facilities used by the US Embassy in Moscow and further vowed to cut the number of US diplomats in Russia from 1,000 to 455 in a clear downgrading in relations.
Later, Sergey Ryabkov stated that Russia refuses to rule out further measures designed, “to bring the US to its senses”.
He further spoke of Russia reducing the number of US diplomats in Moscow in the following way,
“This is the amount that Russia currently has in its overseas offices in the United States. In other words, we are restoring parity, which for a long time was violated by the US and was by and large unfair”.
Ryabkov further stated that the US sanctions are designed to intimidate not only Russia but the entire world and that furthermore, Russia will not tolerate such measures.",The Duran,1
Eric Trump Releases Sad News About 7 Month Pregnant Wife,"Alice Ali 2 hours agoNews126 Views
In the past year, the Trump family has been ruthlessly attacked by liberals. Now, Eric Trump is coming finally speaking out.
Recently, Eric appeared on live television to defend his family from the relentless attacks. He focused primarily on the “upsetting” comments he experiences daily on social media.
“My wife [Lara] is seven months pregnant,” he began. “If you saw some of the comments she receives from people. I can’t even say them on their air they’re so ghastly…There are no borders for these people.”
Eric acknowledged he is doing everything he can to let the comments “roll off his back,” particularly when it comes to his younger sister Tiffany and his 11-year-old brother Barron Trump.
The segment then transitioned to Fox Business host Neil Cavuto discussing Hollywood star Johnny Depp’s recent death threats on Trump. Gayle Trotter explained that the “unhinged” comments could have a dangerous effect.
“It’s sick,” said Cavuto, adding that a line must be drawn because some people may “act on” what they hear.

Adverts depicting sexist stereotypes to be banned from 2018,"A Protein World advert displayed in an underground station in LondonCredit:Catherine Wylie
18 July 2017 • 12:01am
Adverts which encourage gender stereotypes like women cleaning up after their family, or men failing to do housework, face being banned under strict new watchdog rules.
Following a year-long inquiry the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has developed a set of tougher standards on adverts which portray ""potentially harmful"" gender stereotypes.
From next year the new rules, which will now be finalised by the Committee of Advertising Practice, will be used to ban inappropriate adverts.
The ASA found there was evidence to support stronger rules on the basis that harmful stereotypes ""can restrict the choices, aspirations and opportunities of children, young people and adults"".
Controversial adverts by Gap, KFC and Protein World, all of which received a number of complaints last year, are examples of those which could be affected by the crackdown.

The new standards will not ban all stereotypes, such as women cleaning or a men doing DIY jobs. But adverts that depict scenarios such as a woman having sole responsibility for cleaning up her family's mess or a man trying and failing to do simple parental or household tasks are likely to be banned, it said.
The ASA's report also said campaigns suggesting a specific activity is inappropriate for boys because it is stereotypically associated with girls, and vice versa, could be banned.
A poster for Protein World, a slimming product aimed at women, caused a stir last year after an advert stated ""Are you beach body ready?"" and featured an image of a toned and athletic woman wearing a bikini.
Despite receiving over 300 complaints last year it was not banned by the ASA, however it is thought that such an advert may not be allowed under the new rules.
Another potentially problematic advert is KFC's recent TV advert which featured two men sitting in a restaurant discussing the televisions they had purchased. The first character stated: ""I just bought a 56"" plasma"" to which the second responded ""Awww, adorable. I just bought the 90. Because I'm a man.""
The ASA is concerned that gender stereotypes in adverts is impacting people's aspirations in real life Credit:Telegraph
The first character then stated ""It's ultra-HD"" with the second responding ""Did it come free with your scented candles?""
After a third character sat down with the product being featured, the first character stated more aggressively ""You know those candles help with my anxiety... You're a monster"".
The majority of complainants objected that the ad was offensive because it implied that it was acceptable to make fun of a mental health problem, with some claiming it was irresponsible because it equated anxiety with a lack of masculinity and helped perpetuate the damaging view that men shouldn't admit to mental health concerns.
ASA chief executive Guy Parker said: ""Portrayals which reinforce outdated and stereotypical views on gender roles in society can play their part in driving unfair outcomes for people.
""While advertising is only one of many factors that contribute to unequal gender outcomes, tougher advertising standards can play an important role in tackling inequalities and improving outcomes for individuals, the economy and society as a whole.""

Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators plan to examine the meeting and email exchanges disclosed by Donald Trump Jr. as part of the broader Russian-meddling investigation, according to a US official briefed on the matter.
The details of the interactions between Trump Jr., Goldstone and Veselnitskaya weren’t fully known to federal investigators until recently, according to three US officials familiar with the probe. The FBI, as part of its counter intelligence probe and the investigation into Russian meddling, has scrutinized some of Donald Trump Jr.’s business dealings and meetings even before the latest meeting was disclosed, one of the US officials said.
Now, Mueller’s probe will look at the meeting and email exchanges that Trump Jr. disclosed as part of its investigation, according to the US official briefed on the matter.
That may go completely no where, if the account we’re hearing about the meeting is true. But that doesn’t mean there isn’t something else this investigation may find. As of yet, we have to admit there’s not much real evidence…",The Right Scoop,1

A white former police officer has been indicted on a murder charge in the April shooting death of a black teenager who was a passenger in a car that was leaving a party in suburban Dallas, prosecutors said Monday.
The grand jury's indictment of Roy Oliver also charges him with four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public official related to the other four teens who were in the car with 15-year-old Jordan Edwards, said Dallas County District Attorney Faith Johnson.
Oliver, 37, was fired from the Balch Springs Police Department in May for violating department policies. Body camera footage of the incident showed Oliver shooting his rifle into a car that was moving away from him and another officer.
Edwards, his two brothers and two other teens were leaving the party where police had arrived to investigate an underage drinking complaint. Officers heard unrelated gunshots and spotted the vehicle leaving.
Shots from Oliver's rifle pierced the front passenger window, hitting Edwards in the head as he sat in the front seat.
An attorney for the teen's family, Lee Merritt, said Oliver getting indicted is ""one step on the road to justice.""
""We're looking forward to a conviction and proper sentencing,"" the lawyer said. He added that anything less than serious jail time wouldn't be adequate.
Johnson promised during a news conference to thoroughly prosecute the case. With Edwards' parents at her side, the district attorney touted the speed with which Oliver was charged and arrested.
""This is the very first time we have issued an arrest warrant for a police officer before the case was presented to the grand jury,"" she said. ""As we move forward, my office continues to be committed to seeking justice for Jordan and his family.""
Charmaine Edwards said the world lost ""so much"" with the death of her stepson, who was a high school freshman at the time.
""A great kid, a great football player, straight-A student ... somebody who was going to go somewhere,"" she said.
Oliver's attorney, Jim Lane, did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment Monday.
The Dallas County Sheriff's Department charged Oliver with murder in May, less than a week after the shooting in Balch Springs, a suburb about 15 miles (24 kilometers) east of downtown Dallas. Oliver, who had been with the department for nearly six years, turned himself in and posted bond.
Last month, Oliver was indicted on two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public servant in an unrelated incident, where he is accused of displaying a gun during a traffic accident. Oliver was off duty in Dallas when another vehicle rear-ended his and, according to a police report, he pulled his service weapon and kept it pointed at the ground.
A Dallas officer who responded to the incident, which happened two weeks before Oliver shot Edwards, didn't file charges. Prosecutors later sought charges, though, saying the Dallas incident ""showed a pattern of behavior.""
Attorney Jasmine Crockett, who also represents the Edwards family, said facing charges in two separate incidents will be ""too much to overcome"" for Oliver.
""There's no question now in my mind of whether or not he is going to get locked up,"" Crockett said.
She said it also was significant that the indictment included aggravated assault charges related to the other teens in the car. She said officers don't often get charged for endangering others during an incident.
Oliver's is the second indictment of a police officer for a fatal shooting in Dallas County in less than a month after almost 43 years without an indictment of an officer. Former Dallas officer Christopher Hess was indicted on an aggravated assault charge for shooting into a moving car more than a dozen times in January, striking and killing 21-year-old Genevive Dawes.

Florida City Decides To Rename Confederate Streets,"A Florida city has decided to rename streets named after Confederate generals Robert E. Lee, John Bell Hood, and Nathan Bedford Forrest, who was also a Ku Klux Klan member.
The city commission of Hollywood, Fla. voted 5-2 to rename Lee Street, Hood Street, and Forrest Street to Louisville Street, Macon Street, and Savannah Street, respectively, according to ABC News Tuesday.
“It is time to change the names and the time is now,” said Debra Case, one of the commissioners, during the meeting. “We must do the right thing and we must do it now.”
“We have streets named for slave-owning presidents: Washington, Jefferson, Madison,” said Cynthia Baker, a Hollywood resident. “Activists have said those streets are next.”
The Hollywood street signs were vandalized two years ago; a call to rename the streets was raised but went unaddressed over a decade ago. The Florida city’s decision to proceed with the renaming of the streets dedicated to Confederate generals resembles the decision made by New Orleans to remove its four Confederate statues in May. (RELATED: New Orleans Uproots Third Confederate Statue In Early Morning Operation)
“The street names in Hollywood- a city for everybody- holds [sic] sentiments that affect all who live here and not just those who live or own businesses on the streets in question,” Kevin Biederman, a fellow commissioner who voted in favor of the renaming, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “These names should be changed as soon as possible to reflect the progressive, diverse community we embrace, promote, invite visitors to and celebrate.”
“Activists and reformers will continue efforts to create change to enfranchise everyone and in particular minority groups. The sooner this is done, the less distraction from other City business and City expense associated with demonstrations.”
TheDCNF reached out to other members of the commission for comment, but received none in time for press.

Man Accidentally Calls Cops on Himself Via Smart Home Device,"July 10, 2017July 10, 2017 Christopher Kemmett 0 Comments
A man was arrested for allegedly beating his girlfriend and threatening to kill her – after he inadvertently ordered a smart home device to called police on himself.
Eduardo Barros, 28, became angry with his unidentified girlfriend while house sitting in Tijeras, about 15 miles east of Albuquerque, New Mexico, on July 2.
According to the Bernalillo County Sheriff Department’s spokesperson, Deputy Felicia Romero, the dispute escalated into a physical altercation. Barros allegedly wielded a firearm and threatened to kill his girlfriend, asking her,
“Did you call the sheriffs?”
A smart speaker, which was hooked up to a surround sound system inside the home, recognized that as a voice command and called 911, Romero said.
It’s unclear whether the speaker was connected to an Amazon Echo or Echo Dot device, but the Alexa virtual assistant was connected to a landline in the home, Romero said.
According to an arrest warrant affidavit obtained by the New York Post:
“Barros told her she was not going anywhere and he was going to kill her. When 911 called her phone, Barros saw the caller ID and threw [her] to the floor. Barros then kicked her while on the ground at least 10 times in the face and stomach. Barros told [the victim] he could not believe the cops had been called and he was not going back to prison and that she knew he was a felon. [The victim] stated she thought she was going to be killed or shot.”
The woman, who received minor injuries during the incident, was safely removed from the home.
Barros, a convicted felon, was taken into custody after an hours-long standoff with a crisis negotiation team and a SWAT team. He is facing charges of possession of a firearm or destructive device by a felon, aggravated battery against a household member, aggravated assault against a household member, and false imprisonment, according to court documents obtained by ABC News.
Police said the smart device potentially played a life-saving role in the incident, reports ABC:
“The unexpected use of this new technology to contact emergency services has possibly helped save a life. This amazing technology definitely helped save a mother and her child from a very violent situation,” Bernalillo County Sheriff Manuel Gonzales III said in a statement.

NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO Large crowds turned out for Pride marches on Sunday in New York City and San Francisco, the two U.S. places most associated with the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights movement, with the East Coast city bringing a more political flavor to the event sparked by events there almost 50 years ago.
Participants included Chelsea Manning, the transgender U.S. Army soldier who served seven years in prison for leaking classified data before former President Barack Obama granted her clemency.
""Honored to represent the ACLU at this years NYC Pride March,"" Manning said on Twitter, posting a photo of her riding in a red convertible. ""Started to lose my voice from screaming so much,"" Manning, who was released from a military prison in May, added.
A group of marchers heading down New York's Fifth Avenue carried photographs of U.S. President Donald Trump and his press secretary, Sean Spicer, as others waved banners bearing the word 'RESIST' and the rainbow flag of the Pride movement.
In contrast, a smattering of anti-Trump signs in San Francisco was drowned out by a desire to let loose. ""It's too good a day to be upset about Trump,"" said Richard Babb, 66, of San Francisco.
In New York, Brad Hoylman, a Democratic lawmaker in the New York State Senate, said lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people were ""under assault"" by the Trump administration.
""He already rolled back rights for transgender students, for example, and the list is on and on,"" he said. ""So we have a lot more work to do, that's why we are here today.""
As a candidate, Trump promised to protect gay people. But his move in February to revoke the Obama administration's guidance letting transgender students choose which gender bathroom they use, and his executive order last month to promote religious liberty have been seen by some as discriminatory.
The New York march's grand marshals this year include the American Civil Liberties Union, which was chosen for its history of litigation defending gay rights; Brooke Guinan, a transgender woman who works as a firefighter in the city; and Geng Le, a gay rights activist in China.
""Pride this year is showing that we are here, we are queer, and we are not going to sit down for anything less than full rights, full equality,"" said Austin Anderson, a 28-year-old advertising worker at the New York event.
The march route ends on Christopher Street in Manhattan's West Village to commemorate the riots that broke out there in 1969 after police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar, in an event seen as a turning point in the gay rights movement. New York's first Pride march started close by a year later.
In San Francisco, revelers had to pass through one of dozens of metal security detectors to get into the main plaza.
""Happy Pride everyone!"" a security monitor yelled to the crowd, as people cheered and saluted. ""Have fun today.""
Two gay cousins attended the parade dressed in tutus and unicorn headbands.
""We see this as a party, not a political protest,"" Qiaira McPeters, 18, said. Despite that, McPeters said that she feels things for gay people have been getting worse.
""Gay people are getting beat up all the time,"" she said.
In Seattle, hundreds of people marched downtown in unusually hot weather, many in skimpy outfits and carrying pink balloons. A rainbow flag was hoisted to the top of the city's iconic Space Needle.
Seattle Mayor Ed Murray, the first openly gay person to hold that job, joined the parade with his husband, Michael Shiosaki. ""Today we celebrate our unity,"" he said in a video posted on Twitter.
The Seattle Police Department, which put rainbow-colored decals on their patrol cars, said a group of people blocked the parade route for about 30 minutes to hold a sit-in in honor of Charleena Lyles, the black mother slain by city police a week ago. There were no arrests, police said. [L1N1JG04T]

Demonstrators clash with riot security forces in Caracas, Venezuela.
Despite widespread objections, Venezuela’s president, Nicolas Maduro, is moving ahead with a plan to rewrite the country’s constitution.
Maduro argues a new constitution would contain the deadly violence that has gripped the nation and restore cooperation between the different branches of government. A vote is scheduled for July 30 to elect a National Constituent Assembly that will write a new constitution.
However, observers warn a new constitution will violate democratic principles. The governments of Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Colombia have demanded the restoration of democracy.
Yet, Maduro is determined to move his proposal forward. A bad situation in Venezuela is likely to only get worse.

Experts agree that the existing constitution requires the president to call a referendum to allow the people to decide if they want a constituent assembly. However, polls suggest 85 percent of the population rejects the president’s proposal. And, on July 16, one-third of registered voters voted against having an assembly in an informal referendum organized by opposition activists.
Aware that he would likely lose a referendum vote, Maduro skipped that step. Instead, the electoral authority scheduled a vote to choose assembly members.
This move is clear evidence that Maduro is authoritarian. Authoritarian leaders often seek to establish new constitutions to strengthen their rule and control the opposition. This involves excluding sectors of the population from the constitution writing process and legalizing oppressive practices. History shows many examples of countries where governments seek to rule without restrictions.
Some of the best-known examples of this come from Latin America, a region where autocratic constitutions have been commonplace. Take, for example, the 1967 Brazilian Constitution or the 1980 Chilean Constitution, created by military regimes. These constitutions, among other things, banned political parties, legalized censorship and severely restricted civil rights.
The creation of a new constitution in Venezuela fits this description. It would formally dissolve current institutions and designate new authorities (for example, dissolve the opposition-controlled congress and appoint a new attorney general supportive of the regime).
Squeezing out the opposition
Maduro’s party, the PSUV, has the support of only 20 percent of Venezuelans. However, PSUV designed the rules for electing the Constituent Assembly’s 545 delegates, so it will likely control the body.
Fewer representatives have been allocated to regions where the ruling party is a minority. More representatives have been granted to regions where the PSUV is a majority.
Moreover, 30 percent of the seats in the Constituent Assembly have been reserved for “sector representatives”: deputies elected by various groups such as students, workers and teachers, most of whom are controlled by the government. Under those conditions, the opposition has no chance to elect a meaningful number of representatives.
As a result, the opposition has refused to participate in the Constituent Assembly. With few opposition members in it, if any, the assembly would be free to redesign the state at will without consulting the Venezuelan people. Observers are concerned that this body, or the constitution they write, could bar opposition candidates from running for office. They worry it may establish new restrictions on democratic freedoms, such as stricter media regulations.
Former regime supporters, including Attorney General Luisa Ortega, have denounced the Constituent Assembly as a shameless move to consolidate power and institutionalize political exclusion. Foreign governments, like Brazil and the Vatican, have denounced the move as authoritarian as well.
Despite this opposition, the head of the Armed Forces has endorsed the proposed Constituent Assembly, and the pro-government Supreme Court has blocked all attempts to stop it. Cornered, the opposition has turned to civil disobedience and increased street protests, at an immense cost. The toll of people imprisoned, wounded and killed grows by the day and the government shows no signs of retreat.
Can violence be avoided?
The situation in Venezuela is perceived by both parties as a zero-sum game. The military, which holds de-facto power in the country, refuses to stop supporting the government.
The international community – despite strong pronouncements and threats of sanctions – has failed to coordinate an effective strategy to overcome the crisis. And the opposition is struggling to leverage its victory in the July 16 informal referendum to advance its pro-democratic agenda.
Frustrations have been rising since March, when Maduro took over the functions of Venezuela’s lawmaking body – the National Assembly – which was controlled by his opposition.
Since then, protests against the Maduro regime have broken out in which more than 100 people have been killed and hundreds more wounded. Opposition demonstrators are being harassed by armed pro-government groups, repressed by security forces, picked up and jailed indiscriminately and tried in military court. In June, the National Guard stood by when Maduro’s supporters stormed the opposition-controlled National Assembly.
In this environment, radicals from both sides are beginning to feel empowered, to the detriment of more moderate leaders. With the crisis escalating and no solution in sight, it is hard to predict what will happen next.
Between a desirable return to democratic rule and the consolidation of dictatorship lie a range of possibilities, including ongoing conflict and civil strife.

Trump Just Spent Your Money To Furnish The White House; The Amount Will Piss You Off (DETAILS),"GooglePinterestDiggLinkedin Reddit Stumbleupon PrintDeliciousPocketTumblr
Donald Trump is sitting real pretty in the White House thanks to American tax payer’s money. Trump’s old crooked behind spent hundreds of thousands of our money to furnish his new crib. $133,000 to be clear.
Subscribe to our Youtube Channel
That is more than DOUBLE of what former President Barack Obama spent when he stayed in the White House. And Obama actually lived there for 8 years. Trump just moved in after using our money once again to live lavishly outside of D.C. We are talking millions.
AOL.com reported that Federal procurement records for the Executive Office of the President show that from the inauguration through the end of May, Trump’s office spent $133,053.95 on office furnishings compared to Obama’s $51,204.25 in the same time frame.
According to Mic, one of Trump’s big purchases included a custom conference table from the Kittinger Company, Inc. that carried a price tag of nearly $13,000. Trump probably wanted to rid his new home of all things Obama. Anything associated with Obama rears up his jealousy.
Trump’s hypocrisy can even be seen here. Back in 2011, Trump tweeted out at Obama bashing him for using tax payers money on trips.
Why did @BarackObama and his family travel separately to Martha’s Vineyard? They love to extravagantly spend on the taxpayers’ dime.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 26, 2011
Now look, SMH. He’s out spending way more than Obama ever did and it’s a shame. He is one of the richest men in America who boasts about having way more money than what the White House pays but he can’t afford to furnish the White House on his own dime? And when he does use Taxpayer money, sucks them dry! Another example of how Trump could care less about Americans unless they are rich, white and Republican.

Why Trump gave the Jeff Sessions scoop to the 'failing' New York Times,"President Trump shakes hands with Attorney General Jeff Sessions after Sessions was sworn in Feb. 9. (Jim Lo Scalzo/European Pressphoto Agency)
The New York Times's latest scoop reads, at first, like the product of yet another leaked account of a private conversation involving President Trump. Here's the lead:
President Trump said on Wednesday that he never would have appointed Attorney General Jeff Sessions had he known Mr. Sessions would recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation that has dogged his presidency, calling the decision “very unfair to the president.”
This time, however, the Times did not hear about Trump's remarks from a third party; reporters heard the remarks from Trump himself, in an interview.
That's right. The president who routinely accuses the “failing” New York Times of publishing “fake news” handed a big, exclusive story to the object of his fury — the newspaper that just last week exposed a campaign-year meeting in which Donald Trump Jr. expected to receive damaging information about Hillary Clinton from a woman described to him as a Russian government lawyer.
Why would he do that?
MSNBC's Chris Hayes is onto something here:
The sheer #thirst that the president has for the New York Times' approval is something to behold.
— Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) July 20, 2017
Recall that Trump, during the transition period between his election and inauguration, seemed to make an effort to improve his relationship with the Times. He met privately with the paper's publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., and also spoke on the record with reporters, whom he attempted to flatter.
“I will say the Times is — it’s a great, great American jewel,” Trump said. “A world jewel. And I hope we can all get along. We’re looking for the same thing, and I hope we can all get along well.”
To Trump, getting along would mean friendly treatment by the Times. That has not happened. Yet he continues to grant interviews to the paper and seems to consider Maggie Haberman, one of the reporters with whom he discussed Sessions on Wednesday, particularly important. CNN's Dylan Byers described Haberman as the “reporter Trump can't quit” in an April article.
Here's an excerpt, featuring an extremely telling quote from former Trump campaign adviser Sam Nunberg:
“She's always going to have a special place with the president,” said Nunberg. “She's one of the most influential political reporters, and it's the New York Times. It may be 'the failing New York Times,' but it's also the crown jewel, and he loves it.”
There may be no reporter Trump respects, and fears, more than Haberman. He may bash and beat up on the Times, and her, but he inevitably returns to her to share his thinking and participate in interviews. He does so because, in addition to having known her for so long, he knows that she matters, that she will not treat him with kid gloves but not be unfair either, that she commands the respect of the political communities in both Washington and New York.
On Twitter Thursday, Haberman offered her own thoughts about Trump's willingness to talk:
POTUS may not always be doing what some on staff want when he does these interviews. But he knows what he is doing. And he likes engaging.
— Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) July 20, 2017
All of these factors probably played into Trump's decision. “Engaging” with the media is a kind of sport for him, and he does enjoy it. Power and influence exert a magnetic force on Trump, and the Times certainly possesses those qualities.
Trump loves defying conventional wisdom — including that of his own aides. A businessman with a transactional view of the media, he still thinks he can soften Times coverage by offering access.
Whether Trump aides would agree he should have said what he said to the Times — or even agreed to the interview in the first place — is debatable. But Haberman is right; he knew what he was doing.",Washington Post – Politics,0
Russia warships and sub fire cruise missiles at Syria: Moscow,"Moscow – Two Russian warships and a submarine in the Mediterranean have fired missiles at Islamic State group targets in Syria, the defence ministry said Friday.
It said that Turkish and Israeli military “were informed in a timely manner of the missile launches through communication channels,” but it did not mention the United States.
Russia suspended its communication channel with the US about military operations in Syria from Monday after a US jet shot down a Syrian warplane on Sunday, with Moscow accusing Washington of failing to issue a warning.
The defence ministry said in a statement that Russia’s Admiral Essen and Admiral Grigorovich warships and the Krasnodar submarine in the eastern Mediterranean fired six Kalibr missiles at command centres and weapons stores in Syria’s Hama region.
“As a result of the surprise mass missile strike, command points were destroyed and also large stores of weapons and ammunition of the IS terrorists in the area of Aqirbat in the Hama province,” it said.

A Salem man was sentenced to 30 years in prison Wednesday after he pleaded guilty to raping and sexually abusing an 8-year-old girl.
Darrin Foix-Jones, 23, was arrested in November on 12 counts of rape, sodomy and sexual abuse.
During his interview with Salem police investigators, Foix-Jones repeatedly blamed his victim for initiating the sexual contact over a two-month period. According to court documents, he said he just ""went with it"" following the girl's alleged advances.

The victim told investigators Foix-Jones abused her on multiple occasions — more times than she ""could count on both hands."" She told him the abuse hurt, but he kept doing it.
In a sentencing memorandum, Marion County prosecutor Ashley Cadotte said Foix-Jones showed some cooperation by pleading guilty and not forcing his young victim to endure a trial. However, she said, he deserved more than the 25-year minimum sentence.
The reoccurring abuse, along with his ""steadfast shift of blame to the shoulders of an (8-year-old) girl he was entrusted to care for ... whose trust he violated in the most heinous of ways,"" demands a longer sentence, she said.
Cadotte recommended a 33-year and four-month prison sentence.
Foix-Jones pleaded guilty to three counts of first-degree sodomy, four counts of first-degree sexual abuse and one count of first-degree rape.
Marion County Judge Tracy Prall sentenced him to 30 years in prison. He was also sentenced to lifetime post-prison supervision and will be required to register as a sex offender upon his release.

DISGUSTING: The Latest Trump Assassination Joke From Rosie O’Donnell Will Make EVERYONE Sick,"Remember how leftists always say they are so peace loving and hate violence, especially violence against politicians? Well, as we all know by now, it’s a completely different ball game when it comes to President Trump.
None other than Rosie O’Donnell just shared a link on her twitter to a game called “Push Trump Off A Cliff Again,” where you are invited to “take out your frustrations with President by pushing him off a virtual cliff, or into a virtual volcano.” Here is her sick post:
Push Trump Off A Cliff Again https://t.co/YguB3aG8EP

You can also have the President eaten by a T-Rex or push the President into a manhole in the middle of New York City in this twisted “game.”
Some of these liberals and their assassination fantasies are really messed up in the head. Of course we all remember another “comedian”- Kathy Griffin- and her bizarre mock beheading of President Trump, as another recent example of the sick lengths liberals will go to prove their points.
After the attempted assassination of Republican lawmakers, leading to the grave injury of Congressman Steve Scalise, you would think celebrities would understand that these kind of gross mock assassinations are not acceptable or appropriate.

Suspected al-Shabab associate captured in U.S.-Somali raid,"APJuly 26, 2017, 12:17 PM
 
In this Thursday, Feb. 17, 2011 file photo, hundreds of newly trained al-Shabab fighters perform military exercises in the Lafofe area south of Mogadishu.
MOGADISHU, Somalia -- The U.S. military says a mission in Somalia has detained a suspected associate of the al-Shabab extremist group who once lived in the United States.
A U.S. Africa Command spokeswoman said Wednesday that Abdirizak Tahlil is accused of ""facilitating the use of improvised explosive devices in Somalia"" and is detained by Somalia's government.
The Trump administration recently approved stepped-up military efforts against al-Shabab, which is Africa's deadliest Islamic extremist group.
Spokeswoman Jennifer Dyrcz says the mission that captured Tahlil was led by Somalia's military with ""limited tactical advisory support"" from U.S. forces on Sunday morning.
Dyrcz says Tahlil reportedly was granted status as a lawful U.S. permanent resident and lived in the United States between 2006 and 2009.
On Sunday, al-Shabab mocked President Trump in a video that called him a ""brainless billionaire"" as his administration steps up military efforts against the extremist group.
It was the first public criticism by the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab of Mr. Trump since his election. The SITE Intelligence Group said the video included the comments as the extremist group addressed next month's presidential election in neighboring Kenya
The video said Mr. Trump is ""making the United States the greatest joke on earth and is now propelling it further to its eventual defeat and destruction.""

VIRAL VIDEO: Jerusalem On Brink of Civil War – 1000’s of Muslims Rioting For This DISGUSTING Reason,"Jon Anthony1 day ago
Tensions in Jerusalem have finally reached a breaking point, after thousands of Muslims began rioting and attacking non-believers.
Over the past several weeks, violence has been escalating between the Israeli Jews and Arabs, after several defensive and offensive moves on the Temple Mount, a much contested area of control. This longstanding rivalry between those of the Jewish faith and those of the Islamic faith is nothing new.
As we previously reported, a popular North California Imam had called on Allah to wipe out the “filth,” that was the Jews—a story that didn’t even make minor CNN headlines. The Quran mentions multiple times that Muslims are not to mistake Christians or Jews for their allies, and even commands violence towards them in some cases.
•2 Arab terrorists shot dead
— Israel News Feed (@IsraelHatzolah) July 21, 2017
So, it’s no wonder that tensions have reached an all time high in Jerusalem. We’ve seen violence back and forth, primarily against Israeli police forces and Israeli citizens, but this video that’s going absolutely viral tops anything that we’ve seen so far.
There was a smaller riot in Jerusalem, two weeks ago, according to Israel National News, which should have served as a forewarning to the Jewish people:
Dozens of Arabs rioted outside the gates of the Temple Mount on Tuesday evening and threw rocks and bottles at police.
Police dispersed the rioters using crowd dispersal measures. Two policemen were lightly injured.
In Ras al-Amud, rocks were thrown at a Border Police force. The officers were searching the area for suspects.
Channel 2 News reported that the chief preacher of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Sheikh Ikrima Sabri, said during the demonstration, “We are here to protect Al-Aqsa. I call on the Muslims to go to the mosque in large numbers on Friday.”
Since last Friday’s terrorist attack on the Temple Mount, in which two Druze policemen were murdered, there have been ongoing protests and riots in Jerusalem against the police’s decision to erect magnetometers at the entrances to the Temple Mount.
Despite cries for a less violent resolution, it seems that the religion of peace is intent on reclaiming the Temple Mount, something which they hold sacred. That’s why, just recently, thousands of Muslims were caught on video storming the Temple Mount, wreaking havoc and chaos all throughout the streets.
“At least 56 people were injured int he Old City of Jerusalem [on] Thursday, shortly after Muslim worshippers returned to the Temple Mount following a nearly two-week ban by Muslim authorities on prayer at the holy site,” reports Israel Video Network.
Others have caught this graphic footage on their cell phones, posting it on Twitter. Many are questioning why this hasn’t become mainstream news, and are suggesting that the media may have an agenda to portray Muslims in a certain light.
WATCH: Thousands of Arabs riot on the streets of Jerusalem protesting Temple Mount metal detectors. pic.twitter.com/SiPBuxWotd
— Israel News Feed (@IsraelHatzolah) July 21, 2017
The White House has released a statement about the developing situation, as many are fearing it could turn into a full blown civil war within Jerusalem:
The United States is very concerned about tensions surrounding the Temple Mount/Haram Al-Sharif, a site holy to Jews, Muslims, and Christians, and calls upon the State of Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan to make a good faith effort to reduce tensions and to find a solution that assures public safety and the security of the site and maintains the status quo. The United States will continue to closely monitor the developments.
Muslim rioters can also be heard yelling “Allah Akbar,” in the video below. Millions of conservatives are concerned that this could be the USA within a matter of decades if we don’t start to crack down on radical extremism.
Israel has since deployed a special police force unit, as a show of force—they’re hoping to resolve the conflict non-violently, but by now, it seems clear that they’ll be lucky to simply avoid any more deaths of Israeli police. Many Jews have fled the area, fearing for their lives.
While some are chalking this rioting up to retaliation in the wake of Israel’s response to terrorism, many conservatives are concerned that the problem of violence seems to be inherent to Islam. Although it’s clear that not all Muslims are terrorists, one cannot deny the link between radical extremism and Islam.
If you support Trump’s Muslim ban to keep our country safe, please give this article a share on social media! Thank you and God bless America.",Silence is Consent,1
Fallon Beats Colbert First Time Since Trump Became President,"Jimmy Fallon beat Stephen Colbert in the late night ratings race for the first time since Donald Trump was sworn in as president.

(RELATED: ‘Chastened’ Jimmy Fallon Accepts His Punishment For That Lighthearted Trump Interview [VIDEO])
Last week “The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon” brought in 34,000 more viewers than CBS’s late show, making it the first time since the week of January 30 that NBC bested its competition. Up until that point, Colbert has won the race in total viewers for five months. (RELATED: Stephen Colbert Praises Trump After Alexandria Shooting)
However, Fallon continues to lead Colbert in the coveted age demographic of 18-49 with an average of .68 rating to the CBS host’s .42 rating. The numbers show Fallon even beat CBS’s and his average last week by 62 percent.
ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel’s ratings in the key demo fell from .53 the week before to .42 over the same time period and tied with Colbert’s.
The CBS late night host has been very outspoken against the president ever since he took office, while Fallon has taken a different approach and noted that people in his audience voted for Trump.

Greece Looks to Turn a Corner After Years of Economic Pain,"Continue reading the main storyShare This Page
Continue reading the main story
The Greek and European Union flags outside a shop in Athens. The bond sale is a pivotal moment in Greece’s efforts to show it can move forward without depending on international bailouts.Credit Alkis Konstantinidis/Reuters
Greece, long Europe’s economic problem child, is trying to prove that it has made progress in its recovery efforts by announcing plans to sell debt for the first time in years.
The proposed bond sale, the details of which were released on Monday, offered hope that Greece might at last be preparing to wean itself off the international bailouts, totaling 460 billion euros, or about $530 billion, that it has relied on since 2010 to stay afloat.
The sale is a pivotal moment in the painfully fought efforts of Greece to recover from troubles stemming from the financial crisis that began on Wall Street nearly a decade ago and that at one point threatened to break up Europe’s currency union.
If investor interest is strong, it would be a landmark moment, not only for Greece but also for the eurozone. If Athens struggles to find buyers, however, the debt sale could represent yet another blow for a country that has only recently started to see signs of a turnaround after nearly veering out of the currency union just two summers ago.
Continue reading the main story
Dimitri B. Papadimitriou, the economy minister, said his country was “getting out of a rut,” adding: “There’s an opportunity for Greece to become a normal country.”
Continue reading the main story
Continue reading the main story
In a statement issued later in the day, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras described the move as “a significant step” for Greece that would help it “gain sustainable and stable access to the international markets.”
Ireland and Portugal, which were also severely affected by the euro crisis, exited their international bailout programs several years ago and are experiencing economic revivals. The eurozone recovery has also been gathering pace, with annualized growth at 2.3 percent in the first quarter, stronger than that of the United States.
The bond offering does not mean that Greece is out of the woods. It is just the first of several steps that Athens must take to test whether it can raise money in international markets to support its economy and government operations when the latest bailout, worth €86 billion, expires in August 2018.
Greece continues to stagger under a mountain of debt, which is now worth €314 billion. That problem has provoked clashes between the country’s two main creditors, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission, over how best to proceed.
The fund has said that Greece cannot truly recover unless Europe trims its debt; otherwise — so the argument runs — Athens may need more lifelines in the future. Germany, the biggest enforcer of austerity in Greece, has repeatedly rebuffed that demand.
The Greek economy is still reeling from years of severe budget tightening, pension cuts, tax increases and other austerity actions required under the bailout programs. To rebuild its finances, Athens will need to maintain those measures even after the current rescue expires next year.
Holding the course on austerity has been a remarkable turnabout by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who swept to power in 2015 as a maverick political outsider promising to tear up the bailouts and repudiate the budget squeezing. Mr. Tsipras and his leftist Syriza party nearly pulled Greece out of the eurozone in the months after he took office.
Continue reading the main story
Amid the chaos at the time, the country veered once again toward bankruptcy, and capital controls were imposed. People thronged A.T.M.s to withdraw €50 a day, the maximum then permitted. Businesses could not transfer payments. And the fledgling economic recovery that started in 2014 — the last time Greece went to the bond markets — was stifled.
Explaining Greece’s Debt Crisis
European authorities have agreed to disburse $8.4 billion in fresh funds to Greece, allowing the country to keep paying its bills in the coming months.
Since then, Mr. Tsipras seems to have pivoted toward restoring political and economic stability, and the bond offering represents another step on that road. He now appears bent on burnishing his legacy by making the country financially self-sufficient again during his tenure.
Talk in Athens that another surprise election might be held before his term expires in 2019 has also faded away.
Recently, Greece received €8.5 billion from its current bailout to help it make an imminent debt payment and avoid default. That came only after Mr. Tsipras reluctantly pushed a new round of belt-tightening measures through Parliament, including fresh pension cuts and tax increases that sent protesters into the streets.

The positive signals come as something of a relief to Greece’s creditors, who are eager for the country to cut its dependence on bailouts funded by European taxpayers. At the very least, Athens looks certain not to create new headaches for the eurozone before pivotal elections in Germany in November, when Angela Merkel is seeking to win a fourth term as chancellor.
The calmer climate has attracted the attention of investors, especially in the United States, where companies and financial firms appear to be intensifying their search for deals as the Greek economy shows signs of stabilizing.
Mr. Papadimitriou, the economy minister, said that on a recent trip to New York and Washington, more than 400 American investors had told him that they saw the potential to do business in Greece in sectors such as banking, maritime ports, pharmaceuticals, tobacco and tourism.
During the trip, Mr. Papadimitriou added, “people were already asking me when Greece would come back to the market.”
The country still faces deep economic fissures, however. And success in the financial markets would hardly settle a debate over whether the nascent recovery has been worth the pain.
Continue reading the main story
Years of budget squeezing have taken a toll. While the economy appears to be stabilizing, expanding 0.4 percent on an annualized basis in the first quarter, growth would have to surge by much more than that to make up for a near 25 percent contraction since the crisis broke out.
Unemployment has fallen to about 23 percent, from a high of around 27 percent, as tourism, a pillar of the Greek economy, rebounds. Big investors are hiring, including Cosco, the Chinese state-run shipping conglomerate that owns Piraeus, Greece’s biggest port.
Yet many of the posts being created in Greece are on precarious short-term contracts. And work is still scarce, leading some to stop searching for jobs altogether. Hundreds of thousands of young people have left the country, and the birthrate has dropped. Greece’s poverty rate is now the third highest in the European Union, after Bulgaria and Romania.
For regular Greeks battered by years of privation and hardship, however, the government’s efforts to appeal to investors have little meaning.
Stavroula Vardaki, 68, looked perplexed at the mention of the government’s prospective debt sale. “Who cares if they sell bonds, what difference does it make?” she said. “My pension’s been cut six times already. I barely have enough to put something aside for my grandchildren.”
“How did they get us into this mess?” she added.

Reba McEntire Just Took On Every Trump-Hating Liberal…And WON,"We live very privileged lives here in America, but we can’t ignore that there are still some pretty terrible things happening. Society is disintegrating at a disturbing rate, and we just can’t put it back together as fast as it’s falling apart.
While many of the rich and famous are doing all they can to add speed to the rate at which America is going to hell in a hand basket, one fiery redhead from Texas is reaching out through her music in hopes people will try to fix our country the old fashioned way.
Via Daily Info 24:
Reba McEntire is one of the best country singers known to the music industry. She just released a new song which sends a message to liberals everywhere.
“Cause we’re still worth saving, we can’t go on like this and live like this, we can’t love like this, we gotta give this world back to God,” Reba sang in her new song called “Back to God.”
This is an incredibly powerful message that needs to be heard everywhere, now more than ever. We have so much hate in the country because of the last election.
Americans are burning flags, dishonoring our military and police officers, rioting in the streets, and wishing death on our newly elected President. Clearly, we do need to get this country back to God.
You don’t have to be religious to know that our country was much more sane and moral when the majority of its citizens believed that they had a higher power to answer to. Maybe you’re not in a place where you raise your hands and pray, maybe you just take a moment of silence to reflect on how we get back to a time when kids could play in the streets and handshakes were as good as contracts.
Ignoring the problem won’t make it go away and trusting our fellow man to be good on his own doesn’t seem to be working either. Maybe it’s time to consider what has changed since “the good old days”.
When something is broke, you send it back to the manufacturer to be fixed. At some point, we will have to realize that we can’t fix this, only He can.

The Polls Show Trump 2020 Will Lose to Democrats: So What?,"Written by Joe Scudder
The media uses polls to predict Trump 2020 will lose, just like they did in 2016.
Don’t get me wrong on Donald Trump 2020! I don’t know he will win. I didn’t dare hope he would win the first time until shortly before election night. But the media is reporting on polls now as if we had forgotten how wrong their predictions were before. A story in the Hill claims that Trump’s approval rating is low, appealing to Real Clear Politics. I remember anxiously going to the Real Clear Politics polls, hoping to see a sign of hope.
I shouldn’t have wasted my time worrying. I won’t make the same mistake again when I’m hoping for Trump 2020.
The Hill reports, “Poll: Trump trails Biden, Sanders, Warren, Harris, Booker in matchups.”
President Trump trails former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and three Democratic senators in a new poll from a Democratic firm testing possible 2020 matchups.
The survey of registered voters, conducted by Public Policy Polling, found Trump trailing by wide margins against Sanders — 52 percent to 39 percent — and Biden — 54 percent to 39 percent.
The poll also found Trump losing in hypothetical matchups against Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), although by smaller margins.

Wow: Look what happened when Trump put pressure on Apple to create U.S. jobs,"When Donald Trump won the election in November, it didn’t take long for better economic news to start pouring in. Just two days after his victory, markets started a sustained rally, and have continued to reach historic highs. From there, optimism among America’s business leaders surged with renewed confidence.
Since taking office, Trump has accelerated his work to improve the economy. Just a few days into his presidency, Trump issued an executive order that slashed growth-hindering regulations. Predictably, it didn’t take long for the changes to yield promising results. In just a few months, job growth has continued to outpace expectations while participation in the food stamps program plummeted.
Of course, there is still more work to be done. With Congress still trying to pass healthcare reform, growth-accelerating tax cuts have yet to be implemented. Even so, the good news continues to roll in. In fact, the White House may be readying to make yet another major economic announcement.
 After pounding Ann Coulter, Delta goes after Jennifer AnistonOuch: Liberal environmentalist drops TRUTH BOMB on CA gov's policies: will do ""virtually nothing""
Apple-supplier Foxconn will announce a plant in Wisconsin on Wednesday evening, accompanied by President Donald Trump, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a source with knowledge of the announcement told CNBC.
U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., will also be present at the Wednesday evening announcement in Washington D.C., a source said. No exact location for plant has been chosen, but southeast Wisconsin is under consideration, according to a source.
The news comes shortly after Trump applied pressure on Apple to create jobs here at home:
The announcement would come on the heels of a Wall Street Journal interview with Trump, where he said he had spoken to Apple CEO Tim Cook about three U.S. factories. Apple has yet to comment on Trump’s remarks. Cook told Jim Cramer on CNBC’s “Mad Money” in May it would start a $1 billion fund to promote advanced manufacturing jobs in the United States.
On the campaign, Trump made bringing the manufacturing jobs of the future to our shores a cornerstone of his agenda. However, eight years of failed economic policies made bringing those jobs here a tough prospect. But as a successful businessman himself, Trump knows the kind of economic climate necessary to create jobs. So far, that knowledge seems to be paying dividends.

Sheriff Clarke Engulfed In Danger As WaPo Reporter Uses Him To Make A Quick Story,"Posted by Layla Velasquez | Jun 21, 2017 | Liberal Corruption
Polarizing Sheriff David Clarke turned down the position at Homeland Security, causing a Washington Post reporter to leak his sensitive personal details on Twitter.
It was an odd move this weekend when Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke declined Trump’s offer to join the administration as the assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. And even odder how one media outlet handled it. A journalist for the Washington Post sent out a tweet exposing the sheriff to danger because it included his address. There are a lot of questions about her motive.
Clarke’s advisor, Craig Peterson told the Washington Post this weekend, “Late Friday, Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke Jr. formally notified Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly that he had rescinded his acceptance of the agency’s offer to join DHS as an assistant secretary. Sheriff Clarke is 100 percent committed to the success of President Trump and believes his skills could be better utilized to promote the president’s agenda in a more aggressive role.”
The appointment was supposed to be a celebrated one within the Trump administration, and Clarke was set to start at the end of June. He announced on Friday that he would be serving in Homeland Security, particularly to work as a liaison between DHS, state, and local and tribal law enforcement. Clarke is a Democrat but gained a large base of support from conservatives for being a hardline opponent of Obama’s policies.
The sheriff also believes strongly in gun rights as well as having made some harsh comments against the Black Lives Matter Movement. He was a strong Trump supporter and spoke out against illegal immigration and radical Islam. His name had, at one point, come up as a replacement for James Comey. That was set to rest when Clarke announced he would be joining the Department of Homeland Security.
“I am both honored and humbled to be appointed to this position by Secretary John Kelly, working for the Trump administration in this position,” he said in an interview with Wisconsin WISN-AM radio.
But, the liberals wouldn’t have it. They caused a number of delays and proved that the appointment would be subject to all sorts of public scrutiny. Although, it is worth noting that Clarke’s job wouldn’t have required Senate confirmation. It just would have been trial by public opinion; media bashing, until they find something to sue him with.
Some of those issues that his opposition threatened to bring up involved his alleged plagiarism of his 2013 master’s thesis. They also took exception to the conditions in Milwaukee jails under Clarke’s command. In particular, they investigated the high-profile case of a bipolar inmate who died from dehydration in solitary confinement. The guards cut off the water line after the inmate showed a propensity to flood cells. Admittedly, it was media scandal fodder.
Another controversial moment was that Clarke, an African-American himself, had strong words against the Black Lives Matter Movement. He called them “purveyors of hate,” and “liars, and thugs,” among a few other things. Clarke strongly opposed Obama for his support of the group, saying that they are not activists and that by supporting them, the president was supporting that mentality.
Those issues threatened to be the center of a national debate, in which Clarke had no interest in dragging the country through. So he declined the position and the liberals got their way again. That was really all they cared about in the first place anyway. Clarke’s team was enthusiastic about other opportunities he was interested in. He had recently been a contributor on Fox and Friends and had worked with other media outlets as well.
“The sheriff is reviewing options inside and outside of government,” Peterson said. “Sheriff Clarke told Secretary Kelly he is very appreciative of the tremendous opportunity the secretary was offering and expressed his support for the secretary and the agency.”
The statement hinted at greater things to come. “Sheriff Clarke is 100 percent committed to the success of President Trump and believes his skills could be better utilized to promote the president’s agenda in a more aggressive role,” Peterson continued in the statement.
Then the Department of Homeland Security simply stated that Clarke is no longer being considered for the position. This led to some naysayers on the left questioning whether Clarke had even been offered the job in the first place.
That’s when it got dicey. A Washington Post White House reporter named Abby Phillip, who also works for CNN, got hold of the actual offer letter. Great job, chalk one up for investigative journalism. But, then she posted the document on her Twitter account, supposedly to lay an end to the whole debate.
A screenshot of the offensive tweet but with the address appropriately blacked out, because we’re better than that.
But, with one minor (or major) flaw. She didn’t black out Clarke’s home address from the letter. She’s an experienced journalist, she should have known better. Instead, what she did was let anyone know, post-Alexandria shooting, where this man lives. Currently, the address is still not blacked out in the original Tweet.
Was that just lazy journalism? Or was it some sort of purposeful vengeance against a controversial figure? Is the Washington Post that low these days? And would they be that careless if it was a liberal?",Conservative Daily Post,1

Former ACA critic: ‘I can’t even remember why I opposed it’
When the fight over the Affordable Care Act was at its height, both major parties effectively took a political gamble. Democrats believed that once “Obamacare” became law, and families started enjoying the benefits of the vastly improved system, the overheated controversy would fade and the ACA’s popularity would grow.
Republicans, meanwhile, bet on the opposite. The right believed, through a combination of lies, demagoguery, and ridiculous predictions, it could convince much of the nation’s mainstream that “Obamacare” would shred the fabric of American life. These attitudes, conservatives assumed, would be quickly ingrained, to the point that the reform law would never receive public acceptance.
Several years later, with the Affordable Care Act’s popularity reaching new heights, there’s every reason to believe Democratic expectations were more correct than their GOP counterparts. The New York Times has an interesting piece on the attitudes of voters in Doylestown, Pa., where locals didn’t like “Obamacare” – until recently.
[S]entiment here reflects the polls – and how they have shifted. Many people still have little understanding of how the law works. But Democrats and independents have rallied around it, and many of those who opposed it now accept the law, unwilling to see millions of Americans stripped of the coverage that it extended to them.
“I can’t even remember why I opposed it,” said Patrick Murphy, who owns Bagel Barrel, on a quaint and bustling street near Mr. Brahin’s law office here in Doylestown.
He went on to tell the Times, “Everybody needs some sort of health insurance.” In apparent reference to Republicans, Murphy added, “They’re trying to repeal Obamacare but they don’t have anything in place.”
We have a pretty good idea, of course, why some folks like these opposed the ACA. After all, some powerful and wealthy groups spent many months and several million dollars to convince people of … all sorts of things. There’d be a “government takeover.” The country would go “bankrupt.” There’d be “death panels.” “Obamacare” would create “Armageddon.” Change can be scary, and assorted partisans and ideologues exploited that fear as best they could.
The trouble is, as ridiculous as this rhetoric was at the time, no sane person could believe the claims now. The predictions simply didn’t come true – to the point that some no longer remember why they were inclined to believe the nonsense in the first place.
And now, along come Republicans, who were wrong about pretty much every possible aspect of the ACA debate, telling people to trust them. Once their far-right alternative is in place, they say, glorious “freedom” will spread throughout the land. Tens of millions of Americans won’t be able to affordable medical care anymore, the costs for families will impose crushing new burdens, and people will pay more for worse coverage, but Republicans are staking their credibility on their regressive and unpopular plan.
I wonder how many articles we’d see in seven years with voters saying, “I can’t even remember why I supported it.”

Reince: Trump has a right to change direction 01:44
Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump's former chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said in his first interview since it was announced he would leave his role that Trump ""wanted to go a different direction.""
""Look, the President wanted to go a different direction. I support him in that,"" he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room.""
""I'm doing great,"" Priebus said. ""I've been obviously talking to the President for a few days about this. ... the President was great.""
Trump replaced Priebus on Friday with Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, an explosive move that ends a turbulent six-month tenure.
Reince Priebus, shortest-serving chief of staff in White House history
When pressed by Blitzer on why he resigned from the role, Priebus responded, ""I'm not going to get into that personal stuff.""
""General Kelly is a brilliant pick. ... We'll be working on a transition,"" he said. ""It's not like it's a situation where there's a lot of ill feelings. I think this is good for the President.""
Trump made the announcement on Twitter just after landing on Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington.
""I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House Chief of Staff. He is a Great American... and a Great Leader. John has also done a spectacular job at Homeland Security. He has been a true star of my Administration,"" Trump tweeted.
Throughout the interview, Priebus defended Trump and his decision to resign, saying that it was a mutual decision between himself and the President.

""Anytime either one of us think that we need to make a change or move in a different direction, let's just talk about it and get it done,"" he said of his relationship with the President. ""He has the best political instincts.""
Priebus also said his views on Trump haven't changed, adding he's still a fan of the President.
""I'm going to honor the President every day,"" he said, repeatedly adding, ""I'm not going to get into this personal stuff.""
Speaking earlier in New York, Trump offered effusive praise for Kelly, though he didn't hint he would soon be working from the West Wing.
""John Kelly is one of our great stars,"" Trump declared.
Priebus also added that ""bringing in a fresh face"" is a good thing.
""I think bringing in a fresh face, I think bringing in fresh people, is a good thing,"" he said. ""As for John Kelly, I know he's going to be great.""

Progressive: CNN Fake News Not Better than the Rest of the Media,"Written by Joe Scudder
Glenn Greenwald documents that CNN fake news on Russia is not unique to CNN.
Famously, Donald Trump singled out CNN fake news soon after his election victory.
But Glenn Greenwald at the Intercept documents that fake news hasn’t been restricted to CNN. It has been a recurring feature in many major news agencies. Most tellingly, these fake news stories only go in one direction: to portray Russia as a threat and Trump’s presidency as illegitimate.
Greenwald is not remotely conservative or in any way a Trump supporter, yet he writes, “CNN Journalists Resign: Latest Example of Media Recklessness on the Russia Threat.”
Over and over, major U.S. media outlets have published claims about the Russia Threat that turned out to be completely false — always in the direction of exaggerating the threat and/or inventing incriminating links between Moscow and the Trump circle. In virtually all cases, those stories involved evidence-free assertions from anonymous sources that these media outlets uncritically treated as fact, only for it to be revealed that they were entirely false.
Several of the most humiliating of these episodes have come from the Washington Post. On December 30, the paper published a blockbuster, frightening scoop that immediately and predictably went viral and generated massive traffic. Russian hackers, the paper claimed based on anonymous sources, had hacked into the “U.S. electricity grid” through a Vermont utility.
TRENDING ON EAGLE RISING
That, in turn, led MSNBC journalists, and various Democratic officials, to instantly sound the alarm that Putin was trying to deny Americans heat during the winter:
Literally every facet of that story turned out to be false.
Embarrassments of this sort are literally too numerous to count when it comes to hyped, viral U.S. media stories over the last year about the Russia Threat. Less than a month before its electric grid farce, the Post published a blockbuster story — largely based on a blacklist issued by a brand new, entirely anonymous group — featuring the shocking assertion that stories planted or promoted by Russia’s “disinformation campaign” were viewed more than 213 million times.
That story fell apart almost immediately.
The story goes no to list other fake news stories from C-SPAN, The Guardian, and CrowdStrike.

"Shot for supporting education, Malala Yousafzai finishes school","Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai. (Reuters)
In 2012, a Taliban gunman shot her in the head for advocating education for girls in her native Pakistan. Today, Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai completed her schooling in Britain, calling the achievement “bittersweet”. “Today is my last day of school and my first day on @Twitter,” she wrote on her newly opened account, which gained more than 134,000 followers in three hours. Yousafzai, who will be turning 20 this month, had been attending a school in the city of Birmingham where she was treated after the shooting in October 2012. After blogging and campaigning for girls’ education in her native Swat valley, she was shot as she rode back to her village on a bus after taking an exam. Yousafzai has since become a global icon for girls’ education, winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014. “Graduating from secondary school (high school) is bittersweet for me,” she tweeted, adding: “I know that millions of girls around the world are out of school and may never get the opportunity to complete their education”. But she said she was “excited” about her future and promised to continue “fighting for girls”.
Yousafzai has excelled at school and is awaiting the results of her A-level exams next month. She has been offered a place to study at Oxford University. She has chosen to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics, a prestigious course that has produced many British politicians and world leaders including late Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto.",Financial Express,0

President Trump intends to sign a bill providing sweeping sanctions against Russia, the White House announced on Friday night.
In passing the measure, Congress essentially forced the president to decide between taking a harder stance against Russia or issue a veto amid investigations into ties between his campaign and Russian officials.
In a statement on Friday night, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said that the president had “read early drafts of the bill and negotiated regarding critical elements of it.”
“He has now reviewed the final version and, based on its responsiveness to his negotiations, approves the bill and intends to sign it,” she said.

Narendra Modi US visit: Syed Salahuddin designated global terrorist by US; read full US State Department letter,"Narendra Modi US visit: In one of the biggest decisions by the Trump adminsitration today, Syed Salahuddin has been designated as a global terrorist, according to Republic TV. (ANI)
Narendra Modi US visit: In one of the biggest decisions by the Trump adminsitration today, Syed Salahuddin has been designated as a global terrorist, according to Republic TV. This comes close in the wake of former Pakistan envoy to the US Husain Haqqani saying, “I think President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will probably lay foundations of a much stronger India and US partnership.” Pakistan is watching the situation keenly as close India-US ties will lead to a crackdown against its links with terror and hit funds flow from the US. Here is what State Department said on its website:
Haqqani had thereafter added, “I think US has come to terms with reality that Pakistan’s and America’s policies, especially in relation to terrorist groups, don’t coincide.” Haqqani had thereafter added, “I think US has come to terms with reality that Pakistan’s and America’s policies, especially in relation to terrorist groups, don’t coincide.” Today PM Modi has met US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and they discussed ways to boost Indo-US strategic ties. A short time earlier, US Defence Secretary James Mattis had also called on PM Modi. Just weeks ahead of PM’s visit to US, Tillerson had met Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar and said that the trip would strengthen the Indo-US relationship and help advance the common interest in fighting terrorism and promoting economic growth.
Here is the full statement in text format:
Here is what the US State Dept note said:
Office of the Spokesperson
Department of State has designated Mohammad Yusuf Shah, also known as (AKA) Syed Salahuddin, as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) under Section 1(b) of Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, which imposes sanctions on foreign persons who have committed, or pose a significant risk of committing, acts of terrorism that threaten the security of U.S. nationals or the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States. As a consequence of this designation, U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with Salahuddin and all of Salahuddin’s property and interests in property subject to United States jurisdiction are blocked.
Mohammad Yusuf Shah, AKA Syed Salahuddin, is the senior leader of the militant group Hizbul Mujahideen (HM). In September, 2016, Salahuddin vowed to block any peaceful resolution to the Kashmir conflict, threatened to train more Kashmiri suicide bombers, and vowed to turn the Kashmir valley “into a graveyard for Indian forces.” Under Salahuddin’s tenure as senior HM leader, HM has claimed responsibility for several attacks, including the April 2014 explosives attack in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, which injured 17 people.
Today’s action notifies the U.S. public and the international community that Mohammad Yusuf Shah, AKA Syed Salahuddin, has committed, or poses a significant risk of committing, acts of terrorism. Designations of terrorist individuals and groups expose and isolate organizations and individuals, and result in denial of access to the U.S. financial system.

Senate Republicans have unveiled their latest health care legislation, which aims to repeal and replace Obamacare. As expected, both side voiced bold and passionate reactions to the measure.

WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans need 51 votes to pass their bill to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Because no Democrats are expected to vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act — they spent nearly all of Thursday after the GOP bill's release railing against it on the Senate floor — Republicans can't lose more than two of their own members for the bill to pass. (The GOP has a narrow 52-48 majority in the Senate, but Vice President Pence can be brought in to break ties.)
That slim margin means a difficult job for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who must try to convince the various factions of his party to come together and back legislation that was written pretty much in secret and is supposed to be voted on just one week after its release.
Here are nine senators USA TODAY is watching to see whether they break with their party:

Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Mike Lee, R-Utah, Ted Cruz, R-Texas and Ron Johnson, R-Wis., were out the gate just a couple hours after the bill’s release with a joint statement that said they weren’t ready to vote for the bill as-is, but “we are open to negotiation and obtaining more information before it is brought to the floor.”
“It does not appear this draft as written will accomplish the most important promise that we made to Americans: to repeal Obamacare and lower their health care costs,” the group wrote.
Paul told reporters that the goal of releasing the statement as a bloc was to get the attention of Republican leadership: “Now that it is known that there are not 50 votes for this, I hope that those who ... have written the bill will negotiate with us.”
Paul said it was his “hope” that the four senators would keep their votes together as a bloc. But he acknowledged that the only agreement the group had made so far was to issue Thursday’s joint statement.

Sens. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., are concerned the GOP plan would undermine efforts to curb the opioid epidemic, which has taken a deadly toll on their respective states. The biggest sticking point: Medicaid expansion.
Ohio and West Virginia — along with 30 other jurisdictions — expanded Medicaid enrollments under the Affordable Care Act. That expansion has dramatically increased access to addiction treatment for low-income childless adults — a population heavily affected by the opioid crisis.
Leading up to Thursday’s bill unveiling, Portman and Capito worked in quietly and in concert to try to soften the GOP legislation — with mixed results. They sought a seven-year phase-out of the extra federal Medicaid expansion funding, urging GOP leaders to gradually ratchet down that money through 2027. They also pushed for an extra $45 billion over 10 years in funding for opioid treatment as a cushion for those who might lose access to treatment.
GOP leaders included a four-year phase-out of the Medicaid expansion funds and $2 billion for one year of extra opioid money. Portman signaled that might not be enough to win him over, and Capito seemed lukewarm as well.
The Planned Parenthood defenders

The Senate bill would cut Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood for one year, and prevent clients from using federal money for services at the group's clinics, but Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, have defended the women's health organization and said it shouldn't lose government funding.
""I do not like the provision that eliminates federal funding for Planned Parenthood,"" Collins told reporters Thursday. ""It makes no sense to single out Planned Parenthood from all the Medicaid providers and say that it can’t be a Medicaid provider.""
""There’s absolutely no need for that,"" Collins said, pointing to the Hyde Amendment, legislative language that already prohibits federal funds from being used for abortions.
Murkowski, like Collins, is a supporter of Planned Parenthood. In a speech to the Alaska state legislature in February, she vowed not to vote for any Obamacare replacement bill that would defund the organization.
""I, for one, do not believe that Planned Parenthood has any place in our deliberations on the Affordable Care Act,"" she said in her address to state lawmakers. ""Taxpayer dollars should not be used to pay for abortions, but I will not vote to deny Alaskans access to the health services that Planned Parenthood provides.""
Both senators have also been vocal about providing a softer landing for people who had been on Medicaid.
""It’s no secret that health care needs to be reformed, but it needs to be done right,"" Murkowski said in a statement Thursday.
""I can’t support a bill that's going to greatly increase premiums for older Americans or out-of-pocket costs for those who aren’t quite old enough for Medicare yet,"" Collins said on MSNBC Thursday night. ""I cannot support a bill that's going to result in tens of millions of people losing their health insurance. And I cannot support a bill that is going to make such deep cuts in Medicaid, It isn’t any one factor ... But it is all of those factors put together that'll influence my decision.
The most vulnerable senator
Sen. Dean Heller speaks at a town hall meeting on April 17, 2017, in Reno, Nev. (Photo: David Calvert, Getty Images)
Nevada Sen. Dean Heller is considered the most vulnerable Republican senator up for re-election in 2018. He is the only GOP senator running for re-election in a state won by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, and the state also expanded Medicaid under Obamacare — both of which put Heller in a tough position. In a statement Thursday Heller said “I have serious concerns about the bill’s impact on the Nevadans who depend on Medicaid.”
“I have made clear that I want to make sure the rug is not pulled out from under Nevada or the more than 200,000 Nevadans who received insurance for the first time under Medicaid expansion,” Heller said. He said he would talk to the state’s governor — who is a Republican — about the bill and solicit information from his constituents before making a decision.

Trump’s Ban On Travel To Cuba Might Actually Help Cuba’s Economy,"When President Trump announced last month that he would re-impose strict limitations on Americans’ travel to Cuba, he said the policy would put pressure on the island nation’s communist government. Many critics, however, said the real victims of the policy would be the Cuban people. The logic of this argument is simple: By cutting off the recent influx of American tourists, who had flocked to the island after President Barack Obama eased travel restrictions during his second term, Trump’s policies could harm the many privately owned small businesses that sprung up to serve them. In turn, these small business owners will be less able to purchase from other businesses on the island, further hurting Cuba’s fledgling private enterprises.
But in reality, the cause and effect may not be so simple. Recent research suggests not only that tourism does not necessarily lead to economic growth, but also that it can in some cases make a country worse off. That suggests that restricting the flow of American tourists might not hurt Cuba — and could even help.
Economists broadly agree that in the short term, tourism brings money into a country that would not otherwise be there. But tourism is not a magic bullet. In other Caribbean nations, for example, there is a clear correlation between tourism and economic growth: Countries with more tourism are wealthier, on average, than those with less. But if tourism alone were enough to turn a weak economy into a strong one, the Caribbean would be far wealthier than it is. In reality, roughly a third of the region’s population lives below the poverty line.
Why hasn’t tourism done more to boost the Caribbean economy? One explanation may be the dominance of all-inclusive resorts and other forms of enclave tourism, which concentrates the industry in small areas of a country. Many tourists never leave the resorts, so their money stays there too. And because the resorts are often financed by expatriates, tourism dollars flow to hotel owners abroad rather than filtering out into the local economy.
The results in the Caribbean run counter to the theory that long dominated economic thinking around tourism, the tourism-led growth hypothesis. The hypothesis posits that revenue from tourism leads to economic growth both directly (by providing jobs and income to locals working in tourism) and indirectly (through improved infrastructure, which is often built to serve tourists but benefits the entire population). Ultimately, the entire economy improves as innovation and competition spread from tourism to other sectors. A rising tide lifts all boats — cruise ships and local fishing vessels alike. For years, empirical evidence from both multi-country and single-country studies, including studies of Spain, Turkey, Taiwan and Malaysia, supported this hypothesis.
But recent research has painted a more complicated picture of tourism’s impact. A study of South Korea found that economic growth led to increased tourism, but the relationship didn’t work the other way around, suggesting we have not fully disentangled cause and effect. A study of Mauritius found that tourism led to growth, but in the context of broader diversification of exports, suggesting there may be more to the story than just the increase in tourism. Finally, more sophisticated statistical work is now finding that the relationship between tourism and growth is not linear: In some cases it can contribute to growth, but not always.
When does tourism lead to growth? A parallel, more robust analysis of export-led growth provides some insight into that question. Like the tourism hypothesis, export-led growth posits that by focusing on exports, a country can generate revenue, which, through linkage to other sectors, will spur development in the entire economy. Japan was an early star in this model, inspiring export-focused policies in the rest of Asia and the world. But as with tourism, exports seem to produce uneven effects: In Vietnam, for example, efforts to replicate the Japanese model haven’t been working. And in China, experts are questioning the sustainability of the model.
Why have some countries thrived by focusing on exports while others haven’t? Research suggests that countries that do well under export-led growth, such as Japan, do so because they manage to create links between the export sector and other sectors so the economy doesn’t wind up depending too much on exports. These countries enact policies to support citizens’ education and skill development and build a robust middle class that creates its own domestic demand. Otherwise, their economies can backslide if demand for their exports diminishes (such as during a recession) or if other countries become more competitive (China is losing out to other southeast Asian countries in manufacturing, for example). Experts argue that much of sub-Saharan Africa’s economic problems are the result of focusing on exports at the expense of other sectors, such as agriculture. The parallels to tourism are clear: Countries such as Spain that have incorporated tourism into a diversified economy have done better than those — such as many Caribbean nations — that have grown dependent on tourism alone.
There are also parallels between tourism and what economists call the “resource curse,” the idea that having an abundance of an exported natural resource can actually be bad for an economy. Nigeria’s oil wealth has made it the largest economy in Africa, yet over half the population lives below the poverty line, according to the most recent information available. Experts attribute this to the government neglecting to implement redistribution policies, failing to develop other sectors and refusing to let its currency float freely. Sudan and many other countries are experiencing similar challenges. This isn’t to say that having resources must backfire: Thanks to policies mandating egalitarian profit-sharing and diversification, Norway has no such curse.
Oil reserves and beautiful beaches may not seem like they have much in common, but they introduce many of the same economic challenges. Like oil, tourism is an industry on which a country can become too reliant, at the expense of other areas. Like oil, tourism is sensitive to outside factors like global recessions, weather and armed conflict. Unlike oil, tourism is also sensitive to disease. Tourism can also use up the public goods and energy of the host country, even destroying the very ecosystem to which tourists are attracted (sort of like running out of oil). And in both oil and tourism, the key to avoiding the resource curse is good governance: policies that encourage economic diversification and invest profits in education and infrastructure.
Returning to Cuba: Is tourism likely to be a blessing or a curse? Data on Cuba is limited, making it hard to reach firm conclusions. But much of the available evidence suggests that Cuba was ill-prepared for a tourism boom. Despite the recent rise in American tourism,1 Cuba experienced negative economic growth in 2016. And it’s likely that the government estimates are inaccurate, which suggests that things are worse than reported. But the most telling data on the Cuban economy is the lack of it. The government does not produce poverty statistics, which is a red flag that the numbers probably aren’t that good. Independent research suggests that the country faces a growing racial and income inequality that has been exacerbated by the increase in tourism. The expansion of the private sector has been increasing the gap between the wealthy and the poor, and the country’s celebrated privately owned restaurants are accessible only to the wealthy.
The period between Obama’s and Trump’s announcements also provides a few clues about how growing tourism has affected the Cuban economy. The rapid influx of Americans was already overloading services and infrastructure, and forecasts predicted even further strains. Cuba is showing few signs of economic diversification: It is already suffering a domestic brain drain, where skilled workers, such as doctors, are switching to more lucrative jobs in hospitality. Market analysts have touted Airbnb as a private business success story, but the only Cubans who can avail themselves of this source of income are those who own homes and can afford to pay the flat-rate taxes. The government also still manages most of the economy, and getting permission to start a business remains difficult. Given the lack of diversification, the increasing gap between rich and poor, and the fact that the government will be tempted to capitalize on the growing tourist trade through state-sponsored hotels, all signs point to tourism becoming a curse.
There may, of course, be other reasons to oppose Trump’s policy on Cuba, not least that many experts think it is unlikely to have its intended effect. But by pressing “pause” on American tourism, Trump may have unintentionally given Cuba a rare opportunity. Usually countries that control in-demand natural resources have to figure out how to get the policy right while concurrently managing exports. But the re-imposition of travel limitations means that the Cuban government does not have to respond to growing demand quite yet. This could give the Cuban economy time to adjust and prepare for a day when Americans’ travel restrictions are once again loosened. And in the meantime, the lost revenue may give Cuba an incentive to develop other economic sectors. If Cuba becomes open to American tourists again in the future, perhaps its entire economy, not just its tourism sector, will be more robust than before.",Five Thirty Eight,0

JUST IN:  Democrat Official Just Got FIRED After Wishing Scalise Had “F*cking Died”,"Sassy Liberty AMERICA’S FREEDOM FIGHTERS –
The utter depravity coming out of some on the left in the wake of the shooting that targeted Republicans practicing for an upcoming Congressional baseball game that left five shot and wounded, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (LA-R) last week is simply astounding.
An official with the Nebraska Democratic Party has been fired as of Thursday for wishing Rep. Scalise had died.
An audio recording was released of Phil Montag, a technology chairman with the state Democratic Party, stating of Rep. Steve Scalise –
“His whole job is to get people, convince Republicans to fucking kick people off fucking health care. I hate this motherfucker. I’m glad he got shot. I wish he was fucking dead.”
Nebraska Democratic Party Chairwoman Jane Kleeb confirmed the voice on the recording was Montag’s and she also confirmed that he had been fired for his heinous and offensive statements.
Kleeb told Nebraska’s local Fox affiliate channel 42 KPTM –
“We obviously condemn any kind of violence, whether it’s comments on Facebook or comments in a meeting. Our country is better than the political rhetoric that is out there from both the far right and the far left.”
Scalise was shot in his left hip by gunman James Hodgkinson from Illinois. Hodgkinson was a Bernie Sanders supporter and a defender of the Occupy movement. The bullet did bone and internal organ damage, as well as causing significant internal bleeding. Scalise was listed in critical condition for several days but his condition has since improved. He has now been upgraded to fair condition.
Three others at the baseball practice were also shot, including Capitol Police special agent Crystal Griner, Tysons Food lobbyist Matt Mika, and congressional staffer Zach Barth.
Some on the left, including Montag, seem to think that healthcare is somehow a “right.” Healthcare is NOT a right. It is a service. As such, no one has a right to your services without just compensation, unless it is communism you want? Apparently, that is what people like Montag are proponents of. They dress it up and call it compassion but the end result is still the same — Communism — and violence is how they achieve it.

Dallas Co. Commissioner Votes Against Honoring Murdered Officers Because They Brought It On Themselves,"0 0 2.6k 0
They brought it on themselves? What utter and total nonsense!
How in the world did this racist POS get elected to anything? Why don’t the people throw this jerk out of office? It’s all too obvious he’s a racist and only on the side of the criminals.
Blue Lives Matter: Dallas County Commissioner John Wiley Price voted to oppose a resolution to honor murdered police officers, blaming police officers for the assassinations.
The Wednesday vote was supposed to be largely ceremonial but gained unexpected opposition as Commissioner John Wiley Price argued that law enforcement should not be honored, according to Fox4.
“I think it’s interesting in this country how you again try to frame the narrative with regards to other people who’ve lost their life at the hands of law enforcement,” Price said. “No life is more important than any other life.” More
Price was accused of bribery, tax fraud and mail fraud…
Here’s John Wiley Price from 2008, explaining why black holes are racist.

With Donald Trump Jr. coming forward and admitting to meeting with a foreign adversary to gain opposition research on a presidential candidate to affect the outcome of the electoral process in the United States, it’s left the White House in turmoil. It’s also left them in major spin mode.

There’s really no way to turn this story around and make it a positive. Don Jr. messed up and messed up big league.
Junior literally said in regards to meeting with a Russian lawyer allegedly linked to the Kremlin:
“The information they suggested they had about Hillary Clinton I thought was Political Opposition Research.”
You cannot obtain this sort of information from a foreign adversary. The only people Trump Jr. should have met with after learning Russia may have info on Hillary Clinton they were willing to share with her competition to influence the election would be the FBI. Instead, he set up a meeting. This can be considered treason.
Now, according to U.S. News and World Report, Donald Trump Sr. is in the White House growingly increasingly upset with everything surrounding his campaign’s connections to Russia.
“President Donald Trump and his senior advisers are described as increasingly angry and exasperated by the ongoing story of the 2016 Trump campaign’s connections to Russia.”
Further, it appears they are desperate to make the story go away:
“The New York Times, Washington Post and CNN are among the major news organizations reporting a White House in deep gloom, searching for ways to escape the controversy or move beyond it and eager to blame the media for their plight, as Trump often does when he runs into trouble.”
Trump seems to know that not only is his son in trouble but so are many of the people closest to him. After all, his son-in-law and right-hand man at the White House, Jared Kushner, was also in attendance alongside Paul Manafort at that meeting with the Russian lawyer at Trump Tower. Manafort, of course, has worked with campaigns since the 1970s, so any excuse of not knowing any better can be thrown out the window. In addition, even as the *president claims he had no knowledge of the meeting, he used information potentially obtained from conversations with Russia later that same day.
Hmm…Trump’s very 1ST tweet about HRC’s “missing 33,000 emails” appears to be from 6/9/16, after Manafort, Kushner, Don Jr met the Russian pic.twitter.com/sJcSRaSXZv

It would seem Trump is losing his mind and wants nothing more than for this Russia story to disappear. But as it would appear, this story isn’t going anywhere and we may only be hearing the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how deep the Trump campaign’s Russian ties are.
The upcoming weeks and months are certainly going to be interested.

Trump and Putin: Two Impulsive Leaders Fan the Global Flames,"Neocons have been salivating over the prospect of a war with Iran for years; our current president may make their dreams come true.
July 6, 2017, 7:17 AM GMT

The Middle East. Could there be a more perilous place on Earth, including North Korea? Not likely. The planet’s two leading nuclear armed powers backing battling proxies amply supplied with conventional weapons; terror groups splitting and spreading; religious-sectarian wars threatening amid a plethora of ongoing armed hostilities stretching from Syria to Iraq to Yemen. And that was before Donald Trump and his team arrived on this chaotic scene. If there is one region where a single spark might start the fire that could engulf the globe, then welcome to the Middle East.
As for sparks, they are now in ample supply. At this moment, President Trump’s foreign policy agenda is a package of contradictions threatening to reach a boiling point in the region. He has allied himself firmly with Saudi Arabia even when his secretaries of state and defense seem equivocal on the subject. In the process, he’s come to view a region he clearly knows little about through the Saudi royal family’s paranoid eyes, believing staunchly that Shia Iran is hell-bent on controlling an Islamic world that is 85% Sunni.
Trump has never exactly been an admirer of Iran. His growing hostility toward Tehran (and that of the Iranophobic generals he’s appointed to key posts) has already led the U.S. military to shoot down two Iranian-made armed drones as well as a Syrian jet in 12 days. This led Moscow to switch off the hotline between its operational center at the Khmeimim Air Base in Syria and al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the major American military facility in the region. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, at the time the Syrian warplane was hit by the U.S. fighter, Russia’s Aerospace Forces were carrying out missions in Syria’s airspace. ""However,"" it added, ""the coalition command did not use the existing communication line... to prevent incidents in Syria’s airspace.""
At the same time, the incorrigibly contradictory Trump has not abandoned his wish to cultivate friendly relations with Russia whose close economic and military ties with Iran date back to 1992. The danger inherent in the rich crop of contradictions in this muddle, and Trump’s fervent backing of the Saudis in their recent threats against neighboring Qatar, should be obvious to all except the narcissistic American president.
No one should be surprised by any of this once Trump inserted himself, tweets first, in the violent and crisis-ridden Middle East. After all, he possesses an extraordinary capacity to create his own reality. He seems to instinctively block out his failures, and rushes headlong to embrace anything that puts him in a positive light. Always a winner, never a loser. Such an approach seems to come easily to him, since he’s a man of tactics with a notoriously short attention span, which means he’s incapable of conceiving of an overarching strategy of a sort that would require concentration and the ability to hold diverse factors in mind simultaneously.
Given this, he has no problem contradicting himself or undermining aides working to find a more rational basis for his ever changing stances and desires on matters of import. These problems are compounded by his inability to connect the dots in the very complex, volatile Middle East where wars are raging in Syria, Yemen, and Iraq, or to assess how a move on one diplomatic or military front will impact a host of inter-connected issues.
Let’s examine how complicated and potentially treacherous all of this is. In the early days of the Trump administration, an outline of its Middle Eastern strategy might have appeared something like this: the White House will pressure the Sunni Arab states to commit their cash and troops in a coordinated way to fighting the Islamic State (ISIS) under the leadership of the Pentagon. Along with this, the State Department and the Pentagon would explore ways to break Moscow’s military and diplomatic alliance with Tehran in a bid to end the Syrian conflict and bolster the fight against ISIS.
This reflected a lamentable ignorance of the growing strength of the ties between Russia and Iran, which share borders on the Caspian Sea. This relationship dates back to August 1992 when Russian President Boris Yeltsin’s government signed a contract to construct and operate two nuclear reactors near the Iranian city of Bushehr. The two countries then inked an agreement to build two new reactors at the Bushehr site, with an option for constructing six more at other locations later. These were part of a partnership agreement signed in November 2014 and overseen by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Military cooperation between the Kremlin and Tehran can be traced back to 2007 when Iran inked a $900 million contract for five Russian S-300 long-range missile batteries. Because of United Nations Security Council sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program in 2010, those missile deliveries were suspended. However, three months before Tehran signed its landmark nuclear deal with six world powers, including Russia and the U.S., in July 2015, Moscow started shipping an upgraded version of the S-300 missiles to Iran.
In September 2015, the Kremlin intervened militarily in Syria on the side of President Bashar al-Assad. By then, Iran had long been aiding the Syrian government with weapons and armed volunteers in its five-year-old civil war. This led Moscow and Tehran to begin sharing military planning over Syria.
Two months later, Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Tehran for a summit of the Gas Exporting Countries Forum and met with Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who praised him for “neutralizing Washington's plots.” Khamenei also suggested that economic relations between the two countries could “expand beyond the current level.” To the delight of Iranian leaders, Putin relaxed an export ban on nuclear equipment and technology to their country.
In August 2016, Tehran let the Kremlin use Hamadan Air Base in western Iran to launch air strikes on a wide range of targets in Syria, thereby enabling the Russian air force to cut flying time and increase payloads for its bombers and fighter jets. Just as Donald Trump entered the Oval Office, Moscow-based Sputnik News reported that Tehran was considering buying Russian fighter jets, while the two countries were discussing a joint venture that would allow Iran to manufacture Russian helicopters under license.
Next, let’s turn to Donald Trump. In his 2016 campaign run, Trump’s animus toward Iran sharpened only after he imbibed the apocalyptic and Islamophobic views of retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn who would become his first national security adviser. In Flynn’s fixation on the threat of “radical Islam,” with Iran as his linchpin nation in plots against the West, he conflated Iranian-backed Shia radicalism with Sunni jihadism. In the process, to fit his rabid thinking he ignored the theological and other differences between them.
Though Flynn was soon pushed out of the White House, President Trump mirrored his views in a speech at an anti-terrorism summit of 50 leaders from Arab and other Muslim countries during his May visit to Riyadh. In it he went on to lump Iran and the Sunni jihadis together as part of the same “evil” of terrorism.
On June 7th, Trump’s claim visibly shattered. On that day, six ISIS gunmen and suicide bombers, dressed as veiled women, attacked the Iranian Parliament complex and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, killing at least 17 people and injuring more than 50. These attacks were in line with a video ISIS operatives in eastern Iraq had posted in Persian on their social media networks three months earlier, containing the threat: “We will invade Iran and return it to Sunni control.”
Less than two weeks later, Iran fired six Zolfaghar ballistic missiles from its western provinces over Iraqi airspace at an ISIS command center and suicide car-bomb making facility near Syria’s eastern city of Deir el-Zour, 370 miles away. It coordinated the attack with Iraq, Syria, and Russia.
ISIS Targets Shias, Whether Iranian or Saudi
Within months of declaring its caliphate in Mosul, Iraq, in June 2014, ISIS sent operatives into Iran after gaining recruits among the predominantly Sunni ethnic Kurds of that country. And well before the Obama administration geared up to help the government in Baghdad fight ISIS, Iran had trained, funded, and armed Iraqi Shia militias to push back that group.
When it came to selecting targets in the Saudi kingdom, the ISIS branch there chose mosques of the Shia minority. The first of these suicide bombings occurred in May 2015 in al-Qadeeh village in Eastern Province during Friday prayers, and left at least 21 people dead and more than 80 injured. In an online statement, ISIS took credit, claiming that ""the soldiers of the Caliphate"" were responsible and forecasting “dark days ahead” for the Shias.
Recently, Shias in Saudi Arabia have been alarmed by the incendiary speeches of the preachers of the Wahhabi version of Islam, the official faith of the kingdom. This sub-sect is named after Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab (1703-1792), who vehemently opposed the Shia practice of praying at the shrines of their saints and calling on such holy spirits to intercede on their behalf with Allah. He was convinced that there should be no intermediaries between the believer and Allah, and praying to a human being, dead or alive, however holy, was tantamount to polytheism, and therefore un-Islamic. He and his followers began demolishing Shia shrines. Today’s ISIS ideologues agree with Wahhab’s views on this and denounce Shias as apostates or heretics who deserve to be killed.
Within Shia Islam, there are four sub-sects, depending on how many of the 12 Imams -- or religious leaders of the highest rank -- a Shiite recognizes as such. Those who recognize only the first Imam Ali are called Alawis or Alevis (and live mainly in Syria and Turkey); those who do so for the first five Imams are known as Zaidis (and live mostly in Yemen). The ones who recognize seven Imams are called Seveners or Ismailis and are scattered across the Muslim world; and those who recognize all 12 Imams, labeled Twelvers, inhabit Iran, Iraq, Bahrain, and Lebanon. Twelver Shias also believe that the last Imam, the infant Muhammad al-Qassim, who disappeared around 868 AD, will return someday as al-Mahdi, or the Messiah, to bring justice to the world.
It was this aspect of Iranian Shiism that the 29-year-old Saudi Defense Minister Prince Mohammad bin Salman, recently anointed Crown Prince and successor to his 81-year-old father King Salman, focused on in an interview with Dubai-based, Saudi-owned al-Arabiya TV. When asked if he saw a possibility for direct talks with Iran, which he regards as the puppet-master of the Zaidi Houthi rebels in Yemen against whom he launched an American-backed war two years ago, he replied, “How can I come to an understanding with someone, or a regime, that has an anchoring belief built on an extremist ideology?”
Only a clueless person would bet on President Trump parsing Shia Islam or grasping the basic doctrine of Wahhabism. By contrast, nobody would lose a bet on him instantly tweeting the latest thought that crosses his restless mind on any Middle Eastern subject.
The Saudis Target Qatar
To complicate regional matters further, the first crisis of the post-Trump visit involved not Iran or Shias but Qatar, a tiny Sunni emirate adjoining Saudi Arabia. Its transgression in Saudi eyes? It has had the temerity to maintain normal relations with Iran across the Persian Gulf. It is worth recalling that during his trip to Riyadh, President Trump had met with Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the emir of Qatar. And before that meeting, he had even proudly bragged: “One of the things that we will discuss is the purchase of lots of beautiful military equipment because nobody makes it like the US,” adding, “for us, that means jobs and it also means, frankly, great security back here, which we want.”
A couple of weeks later, the Saudis suddenly severed Qatari diplomatic and economic ties, with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt following suit. Saudi royals were clearly hoping to engineer a regime change in that country as a step toward the destabilization of Iran. In response, Trump promptly rushed to tweet: “During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar -- Look!”
Soon after he accused Qatar of being a “funder of terror at a very high level” and, backing the Saudis to the hilt, demanded that the emirate should cut off that supposed cash flow. A rejoinder came from none other than the American ambassador to Qatar, Dana Shell Smith, when she retweeted a U.S. Treasury Department statement praising Qatar for cracking down on extremist financing.
In the ensuing welter of statements and rebuttals, as the Trump administration fell into disarray over policy on Qatar, one thing remained solid: the sale of “beautiful military equipment” -- up to 72 Boeing F-15 fighter jets to that emirate for $21.1 billion, a deal approved by the Obama administration in November 2016. On June 15th, Defense Secretary James Mattis signed off on a $12 billion deal for the sale of up to 36 of those fighter jets. ""Our militaries are like brothers,” declared a senior Qatari official in response. “America's support for Qatar is deep-rooted and not easily influenced by political changes.""
In fact, military cooperation between Doha and Washington began in early 1992 in the wake of the First Gulf War. A decade later the Qatari-American military relationship received a dramatic upgrade when the Bush administration started preparing for its invasion of Iraq. Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler at the time, Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz, refused to let the Pentagon use the state-of-the-art operations facility at al-Kharj Air Base it had built up for air strikes against Iraq.
That was when Qatar’s emir came to Washington’s rescue. He allowed the Pentagon to transfer all its equipment from al-Kharj to al-Udeid Air Base, 25 miles southwest of Doha, the Qatari capital. It would become the U.S. military’s key facility in the region. At the time of the latest crisis, al-Udeid held no less than 10,000 American troops and 100 Royal Air Force service personnel from Great Britain, equipped with 100 warplanes and drones. Air strikes on ISIS targets in Afghanistan, Syria, and Iraq are launched from this base.
In his rashness, Trump has imperiled all this, despite mediation efforts by Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. His enthusiastic backing of the Saudis in their perilous quest to take on Iran, which may end up destabilizing Saudi Arabia itself, also holds the possibility of armed conflict between the planet’s two leading nuclear powers.
The Saudis’ Big Problem With a Tiny Neighbor
Worse yet, policymakers in Washington failed to notice a fundamental flaw in the sectarian terms in which Saudi Arabia has framed its rivalry with Iran: a stark Sunni versus Shia clash. Tehran refuses to accept such a playbook. Unlike the Saudis, its leaders constantly emphasize the common faith of all Muslims. Every year, for instance, Iran observes Islamic Unity week, a holiday meant to bridge the gap between the two birthdays of Prophet Muhammad, one accepted by Sunni scholars and the other by Shia ones.
On this issue, Iran’s record speaks for itself. With cash and weapons, it has aided the Palestinian group Hamas, which is purely Sunni since there are no Shiites in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank. It has maintained cordial relations with the transnational Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamic movement that originated in 1928 in overwhelmingly Sunni Egypt. The Saudis, once its prime financial and ideological backer, fell out with the Brotherhood’s leadership in 1991 when they opposed the stationing of U.S. troops on Saudi soil on the eve of the First Gulf War.
Since then, the Brotherhood has renounced violence. In June 2012, its candidate, Mohamed Morsi, won the first free and fair presidential election in Egyptian history. His overthrow by Egypt’s generals a year later was applauded by Riyadh, which promptly announced a $12 billion rescue package for the military regime. By contrast, Tehran condemned the military coup against the popularly elected president.
In March 2014, Saudi Arabia declared the Brotherhood a terrorist organization, something the U.S. has not yet done (though the Trump administration is engaged in a debate on the subject). Riyadh’s hostility toward the Brotherhood stems largely from the fact that its followers are anti-monarchical, believing that ultimate power lies with the people, not a dynasty. As a result, the Sunni Brotherhood has cordial relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran, which held parliamentary and presidential elections even during its eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s. In the latest presidential election, conducted on the eve of Trump’s arrival in Riyadh, the incumbent moderate Iranian President Hassan Rouhani won, decisively beating his conservative rival.
Riyadh has recently issued an aggressive list of demands on Qatar, including the closing of the influential Doha-based al-Jazeera media network, the limiting of its ties to Iran to trade alone, and the withdrawal of Turkish troops from a base on its territory. This ultimatum is set to fail on economic grounds alone. Qatar shares the North Dome-South Pars natural gas field with Iran. It is the largest field of its kind in the world. Its South Pars section, about a third of the total, lies in Iran’s territorial waters. The aggregate recoverable gas reserves of this field are the equivalent of 230 billion barrels of oil, second only to Saudi Arabia’s reserves of conventional oil. Income from gas and oil provides Qatar with more than three-fifths of its gross domestic product (GDP) and most of its export income. With a population of 2.4 million, Qatar has a per capita GDP of $74,667, the highest in the world. Given all this, Doha cannot afford to be adversarial towards Tehran.
Qatar’s 12-year-old sovereign wealth fund, operating as the Qatar Investment Authority, has assets worth $335 billion. A third of these are invested in the emirate, but the bulk is scattered around the globe. It owns the Santa Monica-based film production company Miramax. It’s the fourth largest investor in U.S. office space, mainly in New York and Los Angeles. It also owns London’s tallest building, the famed Harrods stores, and a quarter of the properties in the upscale Mayfair neighborhood of London. Its Paris Saint-Germain Football Club has won four French soccer league titles and it’s the largest shareholder in Germany’s Volkswagen AG. Little wonder that, in response to the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar, no Western leader, aside from Trump, has sided with Riyadh, which has been stunned by this diplomatic setback.
Tellingly, Riyadh failed to persuade even the neighboring smaller monarchies of Kuwait and Oman, members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, to follow its lead in boycotting Qatar. In addition, no matter what Trump tweets, Riyadh has a problem increasing its pressure on Doha because of the massive American military presence in that country, a crucial element in the Pentagon’s campaign against ISIS, among other things.
A Formula for Disaster
In retrospect, it’s clear that the four members of the anti-Qatar axis rushed into their drastic action without assessing that tiny country’s strengths, including the soft power exercised by its pan-Arab al-Jazeera satellite TV network. Unsurprisingly, their governments banned al-Jazeera broadcasts and websites and closed down its bureaus. Elsewhere in the Arab world, however, that popular outlet remains easily accessible.
As a littoral state, Qatar has a large port on the Persian Gulf. Within a week of the Riyadh-led boycott of Qatar, three ships, carrying 350 tons of fruit and vegetables, were set to leave the Iranian port of Dayyer for Doha, while five cargo planes from Iran, loaded with 450 tons of vegetables, had already landed in the Qatari capital.
So far nothing has turned out as the Saudis (or Trump) anticipated. Qatar is resisting and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has flatly refused to withdraw his troops from the emirate, increasing the Turkish military presence there instead.
From all this, an overarching picture emerges: that the impulsive Donald Trump has met his younger counterpart, Prince Muhammad bin Salman, equally impulsive and blind to even the medium-term consequences of his aggressive initiatives. In addition, in an autocratic monarchy without free speech, elections, or representative government (and with an abominable record on human rights violations), he lacks all checks and balances. The shared obsession of the prince and the president with Iran, which neither of them is able to comprehend in its complexity, has the potential for creating a true global crisis. If anything, the pressure on Trump in his imagined new world order is only increasing to do the Saudis one better and push a regime-change agenda in a big way when it comes to Iran. It’s a formula for disaster on a breathtaking scale.

The Latest: Dassey attorneys welcome appellate ruling,"June 22, 2017 4:24 PM
 
The Latest on an appellate court affirming that a confession was improperly obtained from Brendan Dassey, one of two defendants in a Wisconsin killing that was the focus of the Netflix series ""Making a Murderer"" (all times local):
The defense team for Brendan Dassey, one of two men featured in the Netflix series ""Making a Murderer,"" is welcoming an appellate ruling that Dassey's confession was improperly obtained.
Laura Nirider is with the Center on Wrongful Convictions of Youth at Northwestern University. She calls Thursday's ruling from a three-judge panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ""a victory for Brendan.""
Dassey was sentenced to life in prison in 2007 in photographer Teresa Halbach's death two years earlier. Dassey told detectives he helped his uncle, Steven Avery, rape and kill Halbach in the Avery family's Manitowoc County salvage yard.
A federal magistrate judge ruled in August that investigators coerced Dassey, who was 16 at the time and suffered from cognitive problems, into confessing and the appellate court agreed.
Dassey could be freed, or the state of Wisconsin could seek to re-try him.
A three-judge federal appeals panel has affirmed that a Wisconsin inmate featured in the Netflix series ""Making a Murderer"" was coerced into confessing and should be released from prison.
Brendan Dassey was sentenced to life in prison in 2007 in photographer Teresa Halbach's death two years earlier. Dassey told detectives he helped his uncle, Steven Avery, rape and kill Halbach in the Avery family's Manitowoc County salvage yard.

Move over A-list celebs: Three American heroes will get to play themselves in new Clint Eastwood movie,"July 14, 2017 | Scott Morefield | Print Article
When Oregon National Guardsman Alek Skarlatos, Airman 1st Class Spencer Stone, and civilian Anthony Sadler tackled Ayoub El-Khazzani on a Paris-bound train to thwart a terrorist attack in August 2015, the last thing that was on their minds was that they’d be cast in a movie about it someday.
But Hollywood director Clint Eastwood, a big fan of real-life heroes, is about to make it a reality, according to Fox News.
In this Aug. 24, 2015 file photo, French President Francois Hollande bids farewell to U.S. Airman Spencer Stone as U.S. National Guardsman Alek Skarlatos of Roseburg, Ore., second from left, and Anthony Sadler, a senior at Sacramento State University in California, right, look on after Hollande awarded them with the French Legion of Honor at the Elysee Palace in Paris.

A Tuesday announcement by the film’s studio confirms that the three childhood friends from California have been cast to play themselves in the upcoming Eastwood movie “The 15:17 to Paris,” which will be based on a book they co-wrote about their heroics.
Mystery revealed on how ABC hides George Stephanopoulos’ ‘little-boyish mini legs’

The movie will portray their lives from childhood all the way to the day they helped bring down El-Khazzani, who was armed with a pistol, a box cutter, and a Kalashnikov rifle and had opened fire inside the Paris-bound train.
Of the incident, Skarlatos told Fox News in May, “I still think about it every day. I get nightmares from time to time.”
“It was just kind of a gut response. I guess I was just lucky that I was able to do something and not freeze up. That was the biggest thing I was grateful for because when you think about something like that, you never really know how you’re going to react until you actually do and so I was grateful I didn’t just sit there in shock,” Skarlatos said.
Though the conservative filmmaker has made several movies about real heroes, including “Sully” and “American Sniper,” he never before used the actual subjects in the place of star actors. Although Skarlatos did appear on “Dancing With the Stars” not long after the incident, the men have no real acting experience.

"Singapore Can Have Meritocracy or Nepotism, But Not Both","Singapore has long prided itself on being the smug teacher’s pet of Southeast Asia — the richest, the most advanced, the most envied and the cleanest in terms of both its streets and its government. Ranked seventh in the world in Transparency International’s most recent Corruption Perceptions Index, this image is something that the People’s Action Party (PAP) government jealously guards.
But this carefully cultivated picture is now taking a battering. Singapore’s much-touted principle of meritocracy is being undermined by accusations coming from the last place anyone expected: the prime minister’s own siblings.
The figure of Lee Kuan Yew looms large over modern Singapore. As the city-state’s first prime minister from 1959 to 1990, he is often credited as the chief architect of its success. His son, Lee Hsien Loong, is Singapore’s current and third-ever prime minister. The younger Lee’s success has always seemed an expression of the state’s meritocratic values. Lee Hsien Loong was a brilliant graduate from Cambridge and Harvard who became the youngest brigadier general in the history of the Singaporean military before rapidly rising through the political rank and assuming office as the country’s premier in 2004.
Posts published on Lee Wei Ling’s Facebook page last year — including a now-deleted one that referred to her brother as a “dishonorable son” — had suggested that all was not well within the Lee family. But the feud between the siblings emerged in full force in the early hours of June 14, in a public statement from Lee Wei Ling and her brother Lee Hsien Yang that didn’t mince words. The two younger siblings accused their powerful brother of abusing his position to override their father’s wish to demolish the family home. They claimed that he hoped to capitalize on the iconic status of the Lee house and the reverence accorded to his father for his own political capital, that his wife Ho Ching’s “influence is pervasive,” and that the couple have political ambitions for their son, . They announced that they felt fear of his power. “Big brother is watching,” they wrote — and they meant it quite literally.
The allegations kept coming over the next week, with Lee Wei Ling and Lee Hsien Yang taking turns firing shots from their Facebook pages. They slammed a “secret committee” of ministers that had been convened to deliberate the handling of Lee Kuan Yew’s house, questioning the independence of a committee made up of their brother’s subordinates and claiming that it was a conflict of interest for Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam to be part of the committee, since he had previously given them advice on the issue. They pointed out that Lee Hsien Loong’s personal lawyer, Lucien Wong, was made attorney general — an appointment that the mainstream press noted marked the first time a lawyer who had neither bench experience nor acted for the state in legal matters was given the position. They asserted that Lee Hsien Loong had also circumvented the proper channels by using his position to obtain a copy of a deed of gift they had signed with the National Heritage Board for his personal purposes.
It’s been an eye-popping experience in a country where political malfeasance is normally dealt with firmly, but intrigue is kept behind closed doors. Lee’s People’s Action Party has not only dominated the country’s politics since independence, but boasted of a zero-tolerance attitude to any suggestion of bad behavior.
The PAP government has no qualms about initiating expensive libel suits against critics. In 1999, then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong defended this position in an interview with Asiaweek:
“If they’ve defamed us, we have to sue them — because if we don’t, our own integrity will be suspect. We have an understanding that if a minister is defamed and he does not sue, he must leave cabinet. By defamation, I mean if somebody says the minister is on the take or is less than honest. If he does not rebut it, if he does not dare go before the court to be interrogated by the counsel for the other side, there must be some truth in it. If there is no evidence, well, why are you not suing?”
In the past week alone, the Lee siblings went far beyond saying that the prime minister was “less than honest” — they called him a liar outright. Their allegations also touched on nepotism, cronyism, the subversion of due process, and the abuse of power to monitor, threaten, and harass individuals for his own personal gain. These are statements that an average Singaporean can’t dare to utter; people and publications have been taken to court for saying far less.
Yet it would appear as if there are still perks to being a member of the Lee family, even when at war: Instead of suing his rogue siblings, Lee Hsien Loong on Tuesday night addressed the nation in a pre-recorded message, apologizing to all Singaporeans for how his family dispute had “affected Singapore’s reputation and Singaporeans’ confidence in the government.”
The prime minister has denied all the allegations, and Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam rebuffed any suggestion of conflict, but the situation is still a sticky one for Singapore’s political elite. It has undermined the government’s consistent claims to march to the drumbeat of meritocracy, and — if the allegations turn out to be true — demonstrated a failure to live up to the standards that Lee Hsien Loong himself has set.
“Never give cause for allegations that you are misusing your position, especially your access to Ministers. That would discredit both you and the Party,” he wrote in a letter to his members of parliament after the 2015 general election. “Separate your public political position from your private, professional or business interests.”
The prominent brands of the Lee family and the PAP — intertwined in a narrative of competence, superiority, and deservedness — have helped entrench their power in the city-state. The assumption that only the PAP can properly govern Singapore is pervasive, to the point that saying the opposition aims to form a future government comes across as a threat to public order. The PAP government has not been modest in the evaluation of its own performance, even while gerrymandering election boundaries and oppressing opposition politicians. Lee Hsien Loong described the party as Singapore’s “A-team,” made up of the best and brightest, selected through a system that only sees merit.
Rather than a porous meritocracy, Singaporean hierarchy is now being made to seem a closed, elitist circle. The present saga has highlighted how closely everyone in the country’s ruling class is connected, how much power they wield among them, and how blurred the lines can be between their personal and professional relationships. All three feuding siblings occupy high positions of influence; in addition to the prime minister, Lee Hsien Yang is currently the chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, while sister Lee Wei Ling is a senior advisor at the National Neuroscience Institute. Ho Ching, who is both the prime minister’s wife and the head of sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings, is now being accused by her in-laws of having outsize influence over national matters.
Lawrence Wong, a member of the ministerial committee whose independence the siblings have questioned, used to serve as Lee Hsien Loong’s principal private secretary. Teo Chee Hean, the deputy prime minister who said he convened the ministerial committee, is the person with whom Lee Hsien Loong raised concerns over his father’s last will, and it’s not clear whether the committee was convened before or after this exchange. Emails published by Lee Wei Ling show officials — namely K. Shanmugam and Lee Kuan Yew himself — using their government email addresses to discuss personal matters.
Lee Hsien Loong has now said that he will make a ministerial statement in parliament on July 3, and urged members of parliament to “vigorously” question him and his cabinet ministers. Yet it’s unclear how such a session will be able to dispel suspicions of political patronage; Singapore’s parliament is overwhelmingly dominated by MPs from Lee’s own party. When allegations that tarnish the prime minister’s reputation will inevitably hurt the party itself, can anyone really expect PAP MPs to give their own leader a proper grilling?
Lee Wei Ling and Lee Hsien Yang’s salvos, fired from within the elite circle and plastered all over social media and the international press, have rubbed the shine right off the country’s most cherished myth. At the end of the day, it’s not just the Lee family’s dirty laundry that they’re airing: it’s Singapore’s.

Protesters helped through security by John McDonnell to demand restoration of independent living fund – and Theresa May’s resignation

Protesters in wheelchairs blocked the MPs’ entrance to the House of Commons to demonstrate against disability cuts, supported by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, who reportedly helped the activists through security.
Keith Walker, one of the protesters, said McDonnell came down to security to help the Disabled People Against Cuts activists gain access to the Palace of Westminster, after security staff spotted their T-shirts emblazoned with their protest slogan.
“They weren’t going to let us in, until John McDonnell came down and got us in,” Walker told the Guardian.
In another show of support, the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn greeted the group and was met with chants of “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn”. One of the women activists shouted: “Jeremy, you are with us and we are with you!”

The group came to protest against cuts to social care and demand the restoration of the independent living fund. “This is a message to Theresa May – while we have no justice, you will have no peace,” they chanted. “No more deaths from benefit cuts.” The group said they were also calling for the prime minister’s resignation.
Police blocked the group of protesters from going towards the House of Commons from the central lobby, one of Palace of Westminster’s main thoroughfares.
The Labour MP Dennis Skinner and the Green party leader, Caroline Lucas, also came to greet and talk to the group, who formed a barricade across the entrance to the House of Commons members’ lobby for about an hour.
The awesome @jon_bartley and @CarolineLucas came to chat and say hello to support us :)#CutsKill and #NotOneMoreDay #SummerofDiscontent pic.twitter.com/zJXPIY9X76
The demonstration continued without incident, with some MPs clambering around the stone pillars on either side of the lobby entrance to get past the group and into the chamber.
In a letter to MPs delivered by the group, activists said the funding crisis in social care meant they were facing “a very real and detrimental impact on disabled people’s ability to live and take part in the community”.
The result of the cuts to the independent living fund, a Labour initiative closed by the coalition government as part of austerity measures, has been “devastating for disabled people, locked away whether in their own homes, supported living or residential care”, the group said.
“On a societal level this is a regression of the right to independent living and a return to a segregated society where disabled people are separated from their communities and invisible to the wider public, behind closed doors.”
Cathy, one of the wheelchair activists who formed the barricade, said: “We’re here because it’s the last PMQs before recess. MPs have been quite supportive, John McDonnell helped us get through security.”",The Guardian – Politics,0
White House Boasts of Its Savings in Regulatory Rollback,"Continue reading the main storyShare This Page

The Trump administration says it is moving forward with its aggressive plans to shred government rules and regulations.
The White House on Wednesday released its first official report on its rollback efforts, claiming that during President Trump’s first five months in office it had brought about savings for the economy rather than impose regulatory costs. As a comparison, the report said President Obama’s agencies accrued $3.1 billion in regulatory costs during the same period at the start of his administration. The administration also said it was ahead of schedule in implementing President Trump’s pledge to eliminate two regulations for each new one on the books.
The report shows how the administration is trying to follow through on a campaign pledge by Mr. Trump to broadly reduce regulation and reverse rules put in place under his predecessor.
“The administration is really beginning fundamental regulatory reform,” said Neomi Rao, who was confirmed last week as the administrator of the White House’s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, a position that puts her at the center of the administration’s regulatory overhaul.

“There is a substantial withdrawal and rollback of proposed regulatory actions,” she said. “It is also important to note that what we are doing now is in some ways fulfilling a number of longstanding principles that other presidents have always talked about.”

The rollback has been met with strong resistance from critics who say the administration is overlooking health and environmental benefits of regulations in order to appease businesses, which often bear the financial costs of complying with rules. The critics have also raised concerns about a lack of transparency in the deregulation process.
An analysis published on Wednesday by the Center for Progressive Reform, a liberal think tank, showed a pattern of delaying regulations in the pipeline since Mr. Trump’s inauguration in January. The study found that 42 rules had been delayed and 13 more had been placed under review, another way to slow them down.
“There is a war on regulations going on,” said Rena Steinzor, one of the authors of the analysis and a law professor at the University of Maryland. “In defiance in the rule of law, the Trump administration is freezing rules that are critically important to public health, that will save hundreds of thousands of people from death and also from injury.”
Ms. Rao said that the regulatory review process required a “careful” analysis and compliance with the law, and that much of the action at this stage was on regulatory proposals that were being considered. She said agencies would need to study the costs and benefits of deregulation, just as they would do before proposing regulation.

“Deregulation is going to take time,” she said. “It is not something you can just do at the snap of a finger.”
The White House report, which it described as an update on its regulatory agenda, said the administration’s actions during the first five months would produce annualized savings of $22 million for the economy. In total, 860 regulatory actions have been either withdrawn or flagged for further review under the Trump administration, said the report, which Ms. Rao said was based on data from staff at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.
The administration has not yet put a figure on how much it believes it can save through curbing regulations over the course of a year or longer, Ms. Rao said. “That is what we are working on figuring out,” she said. “It is hard to prejudge that.”
The report cited a series of planning rules and regulatory actions from federal agencies. In one case, the Bureau of Land Management proposed repealing a 2015 regulation on hydraulic fracking, which it said duplicated rules in place in many states. In another, the White House said the Labor Department planned to streamline approval of new apprenticeship and vocational programs.
Continue reading the main story
But this month, the administration saw the difficulty of rolling back regulations when the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, by a 2-to-1 vote, ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency could not simply suspend an Obama-era rule to restrict methane emissions from new oil and gas wells — emissions the E.P.A. had previously asserted were a major contributor to climate change, estimating the rule would cut methane emissions by 300,000 tons by 2020.
The judges said the agency had the right to reverse the methane regulations but would have to undertake a new rule-making process to undo the Obama administration’s regulation, creating a formal public record to document why the rule was no longer necessary or justified under federal law.
Asked about the ruling, Ms. Rao acknowledged there were “concerns” about the impact of the ruling. “Agencies want to move quickly to get things done, to fulfill their priorities,” she said, adding that her office would be working with agencies to be sure they follow the law and are “doing things the right way.”

CNN Responds To Trump’s AM Twitter-Bashing By Humiliating Him With A ‘Fact Check’,"Caleb R. Newton-June 27, 2017
President Trump took to Twitter early Tuesday morning to bash the media, something that he obviously loves to do whenever given the opportunity. This time CNN responded, and it’s perfect.
The thing that gave Trump the opportunity to bash the media this time is the Monday announcement that three prominent journalists were resigning from CNN in the wake of the network being forced to retract a story. This story wasn’t just any story; it linked Trump associates, including Anthony Scaramucci to a Russian investment fund that the story claimed had attracted the attention of the Congressional investigators looking into the Russia issue.
However, the story was based entirely off the testimony of a single anonymous source. It was little more than a rumor and was eventually pulled from the website and a formal retraction and apology to Scaramucci was issued.
Scaramucci accepted the apology and said that he was ready to move on, writing on Twitter after CNN retracted the story:
‘.@CNN did the right thing. Classy move. Apology accepted. Everyone makes mistakes. Moving on.’
.@CNN did the right thing. Classy move. Apology accepted. Everyone makes mistakes. Moving on. https://t.co/lyVajCKNHx
— Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) June 24, 2017
Trump, however, yet again showed himself far more interested in ruthlessly protecting his public image than in abiding by basic standards of human decency and did not accept CNN’s apology.
Early Tuesday morning on Twitter, Trump wrote:
‘Wow, CNN had to retract big story on “Russia,” with 3 employees forced to resign. What about all the other phony stories they do? FAKE NEWS! Fake News CNN is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony Russian stories. Ratings way down!’
Only a minority of the assertions in those tweets are actually correct, as the network itself pointed out to the president in a response posted on Twitter. Yes, CNN accepted the resignations of three journalists — Thomas Frank, Eric Lichtblau, and Lex Haris — in the midst of the fallout over the publication of the story in question.
However, for one, Trump cites no examples of “all the other phony stories they do,” and there’s a good reason for that — there aren’t any.
In addition, CNN’s ratings, according to the network, aren’t actually “way down.”
CNN Communications responded to Trump by writing, “CNN just posted it’s most-watched second quarter in history. Those are the facts.”

Nancy Pelosi brushes off talk of who will be speaker if Democrats win the House in 2018: 'So unimportant',"| Jul 30, 2017, 12:25 PMShare on TwitterShare on FacebookEmail this articleShare on LinkedIn
""It's so unimportant. What is important is that we have a lively debate on a better deal, better pay, better jobs, and a better future,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi refused to say whether she would run for speaker if Democrats take back the House in 2018, calling the question ""so unimportant"" as compared to the Democrats' new agenda.
""It's so unimportant. What is important is that we have a lively debate on a better deal, better pay, better jobs, and a better future,"" Pelosi said on ""Fox News Sunday.""
""And that's what we look forward to having. We have unity in our party. You saw with the fight on Affordable Care Act in the House and in the Senate.""
Pelosi fought against suggestions that she's too old to continue as the leader of the House Democrats and said there's no one in the chamber who can do the job like she can.
""Self-promotion is a terrible thing, but somebody has got to do it,"" she said.
""And I think that the situation that we are in, I am a master legislator. I know the budget to the nth degree. I know the motivation of people. I respect the people who are in Congress.""

Muslim Student Killed: Questions Islam in Public [VIDEO],"by Kevin Jackson | Jul 17, 2017
Muslim Student Killed: Questions Islam in Public
This video should be required viewing for leftists.
These morons believe those practicing Islam can be reasoned with.
Perhaps. As long as they don’t have the numbers. But when Islam outnumbers you, questioning the cult will get you killed.
As reported in Teo Info,
College student Mashal Khan was attending Abdul Wali Kahn University, in Mardan, Pakistan, when he made the fatal mistake of believing that Islam allows critical thinking. After the journalism major politely expressed his liberal views, at least 10 offended Muslim students broke into his dormitory room and stripped, beat, shot, and threw his mutilated body from the building while shouting “Allahu Akbar,” Reuters and Newsweek report.
“The student has been brutally murdered by his fellow students,” said Niaz Saeed, a senior police official. “He was badly tortured after being shot at a close range… He was beaten with sticks, bricks, and hands,” Saeed said, adding that hundreds of people had been involved in the attack.
Khan had openly published his progressive views, which most Western liberals share, in a message in early March, according to The Blaze. Although the left-wing refutes the notion, Khan’s Muslim classmates proved that Islam prohibits freedom of expression, especially when it embodies such liberal values.
There is little I need to add here, except statistics on how Muslims assimilate.
The fact is that once Muslims get the majority, life as you know it as a Christian ends. This happens in 4 stages:
Muslims begin moving to non-Muslim countries in increasing numbers and the beginning of cultural conflicts are visible, though often subtle.
* Attempts to portray Islam as peaceful & Muslims as victims of misunderstanding and racism (even though Islam is not a ‘race’).
How many nations are suffering from Islamic infiltration? One? A handful? Nearly every nation? The Islamic ‘leadership” of the Muslim Brotherhood and others wish to dissolve each nation’s sovereignty and replace it with the global imposition of Islamic sharia law. Sharia law, based on the koran, sira and hadith, condemns liberty and forbids equality and is inconsistent with the laws of all Western nations. As the author and historian Serge Trifkovic states:
Visit Civilus Defendus for more proof of where most of the world finds itself.
As Teo Info continues,
Further proving that violence is a widespread religious merit among the worldwide Muslim community, witnesses say that the local police refused to intervene as the students carried out the prescribed Islamic punishment for Khan’s liberal views, which are described by the Quran as “blasphemy.”
Rehman, the caretaker, said Khan was alive when the police arrived, but that they did not approach the hostel until it was too late. “They could have easily saved his life but they stood away from the mob … I heard one officer say it’s good that they sent this non-believer to hell,” he said.
In addition, the local imam refused to perform the last rights for Khan because of the allegation of blasphemy against the deceased, the Express Tribune reports. Khan’s parents could only find a technician to perform the funeral, as Muslims have shunned the entire family and are warning followers not to give them any help. The technician who stood in the cleric’s place is now being targeted by offended Muslims.
No one condemned the horrific violence. In fact, even Khan’s own teacher offered veiled criticism of his willingness to express un-Islamic beliefs.
“Whatever he had to say, he would say it openly, but he didn’t understand the environment he was living in,” said one of Mashal’s teachers at Abdul Wali Khan University, who declined to be named for fear of retribution.
At least 20 students have been arrested in relation to Khan’s murder. No charges have been reported yet, but we can expect that if Khan is ruled to have blasphemed, his murderers may go free.
And you wonder why nobody dare question Islam where Muslims rule?
Ask yourself if you can have an open dialogue about Christianity without fear of death in ANY country?
I’d like to know what leftists would question Islam, if you know this will be your fate? Do you ever hear of academics holding symposiums where they debate the existence of Allah?
Muslims behave barbaric when challenged. The only way to survive is to capitulate. But run astray as all humans do from any doctrine, and Muslims are ruthless and unrelenting.
This will not happen in America, at least not for the time being. Let’s pray for our posterity that Islam never gains a significant foothold in America.

President Trump Whines Over Obamacare Repeal Defeat Because He’s Pathetically Ineffective,"President Trump complained today about Senate filibuster rules, after the GOP failed miserably to repeal Obamacare after multiple attempts. The GOP’s “skinny” repeal bill failed at 49-51 after three GOP senators, Susan Collins, John McCain and Lisa Murkowski, all voted no. Trump is now calling for an end to the filibuster rule with hopes that repeal can be passed later on.
Filibuster dates back to an 1806 rule change to Senate rules. Our contemporary Senate is now a “60-vote institution”, with 60 votes required for approving measures or matters. Trump posted this morning that he wants to see these rules changed, which seems highly unlikely given how long they have been around.
“If Republicans are going to pass great future legislation in the Senate, they must immediately go to a 51 vote majority, not senseless 60,” Trump posted this morning, “Even though parts of healthcare could pass at 51, some really good things need 60. So many great future bills & budgets need 60 votes.”
Trump can’t win by the rules, so he wants to change them. The GOP and Trump fail to see the obvious, that they have provided absolutely no justification as to why Obamacare should be repealed. They have not provided a reasonable alternative to something that most Americans are in opposition of repealing in the first place.

Can International Litigation Solve the India-Sri Lanka Fishing Dispute?,"Sri Lanka accuses Indian fishermen of illegally trawling its side of the Palk Strait.
This week, Sri Lanka adopted an amendment to its Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act banning bottom-trawling fishing in its waters. Those in violation of the new law will face a significant fine and the possibility of two years in prison. It is an important move for Sri Lanka in addressing Indian fishing in the Palk Strait.
The Palk Strait lies between the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. It was recently estimated that 1,000 Indian fishing trawlers are taking 200,000 kilograms of fish in a day from the Sri Lankan side of the boundary. Both the ongoing depletion of fish stocks as well as Indian fishers’ continued use of bottom trawler fishing vessels in Sri Lankan waters have been a source of high tension between India and Sri Lanka.
The adoption of this amendment is an important step forward for Sri Lanka, as it ensures that the island state has the proper legal framework in place to take action to protect its resources and its marine environment. It also sends a strong signal to its own fishers and to India that it wants this practice stopped now.
Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.
The critical questions that follow are whether Indian fishers will heed the ban and how zealous Sri Lanka will be in the enforcement of its new law.
India has thus far urged restraint by Sri Lanka. Such a policy would make sense as the central Indian government seeks to ensure good relationships with state governments. This approach is critical in relation to Tamil Nadu where many of the fishers are also involved in state politics.
But how restrained does Sri Lanka need to be? Acting sooner rather than later may be preferable to ensure the long-term sustainability of the fish stocks and the preservation of the marine environment. Continued progress on this issue is essential to respond to the needs of the impoverished Tamils living in northern Sri Lanka.
Depending on how law enforcement efforts proceed, one further option for Sri Lanka to consider is litigation under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Both India and Sri Lanka are parties to this treaty. As parties, each has consented to the possibility of disputes concerning the interpretation and application of the UN Convention being referred to international arbitration.
Sri Lanka could readily claim that India has failed to act with sufficient diligence in preventing illegal fishing in Sri Lanka’s waters. It will be a question of fact as to whether India can demonstrate that it has done enough. India’s response to Sri Lanka’s bottom-trawling ban will become a vital part of this assessment.
Dispute settlement under the UN Convention has already addressed these sorts of questions. In an Advisory Opinion for the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea noted that states are to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance with fishing laws. States are also to take measures to prevent illegal fishing by those vessels flying its flag. In the South China Sea arbitration, a tribunal found that China was aware of, tolerated, and failed to exercise due diligence over Chinese flagged vessels in violation of the Philippines’ fishing rights.
Sri Lanka could also argue that allowing the continued practice of bottom trawling is a violation of India’s obligations to protect and preserve the marine environment. It is well recognized under the UN Convention that the conservation of marine living resources is an element in the protection and preservation of the marine environment. In the South China Sea arbitration, China’s failure to prevent its fishers from engaging in harvesting in a manner that was severely destructive of the ecosystem, in this context the use of dynamite and propeller chopping, violated the UN Convention.
In instituting proceedings, Sri Lanka would also have the possibility of seeking provisional measures pending the resolution of the dispute. Provisional measures might allow for an order that India take all steps immediately to prevent bottom trawling by its nationals in the Palk Strait so as to prevent on an urgent basis serious harm to the marine environment.
While this legal option is clearly open to Sri Lanka, is it politically feasible? One of the notable features about litigation under the UN Convention of late is that smaller states have been taking on larger states as a way of asserting their rights in a way that has not proven successful in other forums. Such was the situation for the Philippines against China, Mauritius against the United Kingdom, and even the Netherlands against Russia. Sri Lanka can note that Bangladesh has previously pursued this option against India.
Sri Lanka would of course be sensitive to the political relationship between the central government in India and the state government in Tamil Nadu. Yet one advantage of international litigation is that the judgment may provide a government with a new basis to act. The central government might find itself with more leverage over the state government if it has to take prompt action because it must show its commitment to the rule of international law in complying with a possible award against it.
Such a show of commitment for India would be appropriate following the recent election of Neeru Chadha to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. Moreover, India has previously shown its support of the rules-based system established under the UN Convention in resolving other maritime disputes.
For example, India could have blocked Bangladesh in its efforts to resolve their maritime boundary dispute through litigation under the UN Convention. However, India was prepared to settle this long-standing dispute with its less-powerful neighbor through arbitration under the UN Convention. India also has experience as a respondent to a case under the UN Convention with Italy’s challenges to India’s exercise of jurisdiction over two of its marines on the MV Enrica Lexie.
In light of this experience, a Sri Lankan effort to utilize international litigation may not be an excessive diplomatic affront to India. As a smaller state forging a new foreign policy post-civil war, Sri Lanka can and should show its commitment to the rules-based international system.
While international litigation may be perceived as a hostile move between countries, it actually takes a major bilateral issue off the table and allows discussion on other important topics between the parties while the case runs its course. This was an important advantage for Australian diplomats in their dealings with Japan once litigation over Japan’s whaling activities began.
Taking on this fight against its neighbor may prove too daunting for Sri Lanka. For the moment, the enforcement of its new trawler ban will be a priority. However, going forward its negotiating position with India should at least be strengthened in the knowledge that there is an international legal system at its disposal to support Sri Lanka in stopping damaging fishing practices in its part of the Palk Strait.

Situation Report: Unintended Consequences in Syria; Help wanted at CFIUS; Torture allegations in Yemen; Trump’s Tapes; and a bit more.,"U.S. taxpayers are helping Bashar Al-Assad in eastern Syria. Aide shipments heavily funded by American and European taxpayers are ending up in Deir Ezzor, where it’s helped the Syrian regime and its Russian and Iranian backers. FP’s Colum Lynch: “The feeding of Deir Ezzor provides a poignant illustration of how Syria and its allies have harnessed the good intentions of the United States, the United Nations and other international donors to advance its military interests during the country’s more than 6-year civil war.” More here.
For more, FP’s Dan De Luce and Paul McLeary recently wrote about how the increasing U.S. role in the Syrian conflict is putting U.S. troops in closer proximity to Iranian-backed militias in the country’s southeast. And FP reported last week about an internal debate in the administration about whether to go after the Iranian proxies more aggressively near the Syria-Iraq border. Meanwhile, Turkey announced on Thursday that it had reached an agreement with Russia to send more troops to Syria’s northwest Idlib province.
Vacancies at CFIUS. The panel responsible for strengthening government scrutiny of foreign investment is stymied by a lack of staffing and a massive workload. FP’s David Francis: “The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is charged with making sure that foreign acquisitions of American firms do not present a threat to U.S. national security. CFIUS, in theory, could be a valuable tool to curb Chinese investments in America, a central concern for the current White House.” More here.
Secret prisons in Yemen. The Associated Press reports that hundreds rounded up in the hunt for al-Qaida militants are missing in a maze of secret prisons where “abuse is routine and torture extreme — including the ‘grill,’ in which the victim is tied to a spit like a roast and spun in a circle of fire.”
AP: “Senior American defense officials acknowledged Wednesday that U.S. forces have been involved in interrogations of detainees in Yemen but denied any participation in or knowledge of human rights abuses. Interrogating detainees who have been abused could violate international law, which prohibits complicity in torture.” More here.
What tapes? President Trump now denies that he made secret recordings of his talks with former FBI Director James Comey. FP’s Elias Groll: “Trump himself raised the possibility that there were ‘tapes’ of those discussions in a tweet last month, but then he backtracked in a series of tweets on Thursday, saying he ‘did not make’ and does not have recordings of his talks with the former FBI chief.”
Yemen strikes. The U.S. Central Command announced Thursday that a U.S. airstrike in Yemen killed Abu Khattab al Awlaqi, the emir for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula’s Shabwa province, and two other militants. A statement from the command described Al Awlaqi as a “senior leader responsible for planning and conducting terrorist attacks against civilians.” The June 16 strike was the latest in what has been a stepped-up pace of strikes in Yemen against the terrorist group under the Trump administration, which has given commanders on the ground more leeway to carry out military operations than the Obama administration. Read more here from FP’s Dan De Luce and McLeary about the new wave of U.S. bombing in Yemen under Trump.
Welcome to Situation Report. Your regular presenter, Paul McLeary, is out today, but will be back in the saddle Monday. You can reach him at paul.mcleary@foreignpolicy.com or either he or Adam on Twitter @paulmcleary and @arawnsley.
China’s way. A delegation of Chinese security officials, among them Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi, met with their counterparts at the White House on Thursday, including National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster. But there’s no sign of a major breakthrough on the Trump administration’s bid to persuade Beijing to come down hard on North Korea. White House and State Department officials say China has taken some “modest” steps to curtail trade with North Korea, but the results are not the sea-change desired by the administration.
“They’re making their own judgements on how much pressure to bring on North Korea,” an administration official told FP’s Dan De Luce. “There’s no change in their fundamental calculation,” the official said. China wants to discourage North Korea’s missile launches and other violations of U.N. Security resolutions, but it’s also determined to avoid causing the collapse of the Pyongyang regime. “China has sought to steadily increase pressure on North Korea. But it’s for their own purposes and based on their own assessment of what the traffic will bear.”
Russia sanctions. The Trump White House is closely watching the progress in the House of a sanctions bill passed by the Senate to ratchet up punitive measures on Moscow. The bill would require congressional approval for sanctions to be lifted, and the White House would like to see the measure watered down. A senior White House official told   on Thursday that the Trump administration is looking to maintain flexibility in the relationship with Russia but refused to say exactly what changes they are seeking in the measure. The bill is currently caught up in a procedural dispute between the House and Senate, and senior lawmakers said on Thursday they are looking to make a quick fix and advance the measure. But the bill’s final shape and when it might be passed into law remains in flux.
Starship troopers. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-AL) wants the Air Force to set up its own Space Corps and he’s not going to take “no” for an answer. Breaking Defense reports that the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee’s Strategic Forces Subcommittee told reporters that he’s “outraged” that the service isn’t considering his proposal to carve out one of the Air Force’s missions for a separate space service. Newly-confirmed Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson has dismissed the idea as unnecessary bureaucracy, but Rogers says the service needs to either reform its space operations or brace for reforms driven by Congress without their input.
Espionage. Federal prosecutors have charged a former State Department diplomat with spying for China and selling classified documents for cash. In court documents released Thursday, the government alleges that Kevin Mallory, who worked at the State Department in the late 1980s and as a defense contractor afterwards, was stopped by customs officials at the airport while carrying $16,500 in undeclared cash on a trip back from Shanghai. A search of an electronic device belonging to Mallory allegedly turned up documents classified as Secret and Top Secret sent to a contact in China.
F-35. A software glitch in the logistics system for the F-35B has grounded the Marine Corps’s stealth fighter at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, AZ, Inside Defense reports. The problem is in the jet’s Autonomic Logistics Information System, which helps maintenance personnel and flight planners to keep track of repairs, supply chains, and other logistical issued. Marine Corps officials say the halt in flights is “very temporary” and they expect the problem to be solved shortly.
Loaners. Turkey says the Defense Department told it the U.S. will take back all the weapons it’s giving to the anti-Islamic State Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) once the fight is over. Turkey has been irritated by the U.S. decision to directly arm the predominantly Kurdish forces, fearing that the weapons and support could bolster militant Kurdish nationalism among groups Turkey considers to be terrorists. Reuters reports that Turkish officials claim Secretary of Defense James Mattis promised to give Ankara a running inventory of all the weapons it provides to SDF troops as part of the push to dislodge the Islamic State from eastern Syria and its capital in Raqqa.
Transgender plans. Top Pentagon officials were due to meet this week on plans to open the door to transgender troops. Each of the armed services were supposed to draw up a blueprint for how to educate troops about the change and to start accepting recruits after July 1. The last defense secretary, Ash Carter, made the policy change last year. But it’s unclear if Defense Secretary James Mattis will take action to delay or reverse the policy, which is opposed by many Republican lawmakers and conservative commentators.
Longshot. A Canadian special operations soldier has recorded the longest distance kill in history, according to the Globe and Mail. Canadian military sources told the paper that a member of Canada’s Joint Task Force 2 killed an Islamic State fighter in Iraq from over two miles away using a .50 caliber sniper rifle. The Canadian Special Operations Command confirmed the story to the BBC, saying that the shot prevented Canadian forces from having to hit the target with an airstrike, potentially risking nearby civilians. Canadian troops in Iraq operated under strict rules of engagement, with troops forbidden to engage in combat unless they detect hostile intent from potential enemies. But the claim has been met with some skepticism in the twitter-sniper-verse.
Casualties. Reporters for The Intercept spoke to locals present at the scene of a U.S. airstrike on a mosque in Syria back in April and they paint a drastically different picture of the incident than the Pentagon. Defense Department investigators didn’t interview eyewitnesses for their report into the strike, but they say the airstrike targeted a meeting of al-Qaeda officials and that only one person, possible a child, was killed in the strike. Locals and first responders tell the news outlet that the mosque was filled with civilians attending services and religious teachers who had no connection to militant groups. Human rights groups have estimated that as many as 38 civilians were killed in the strike.
Tick tock. It can be hard keeping track of the tit-for-tat incidents of escalation between the U.S. and pro-Assad regime forces in Syria. Thankfully, Just Security has you covered with a handy timeline of events since the April 2017 chemical weapons attack in Khan Shaykhun.",Foreign Policy,0
WATCH: Former RNC Chairman Michael Steele RIPS Republicans For Still Supporting Trump,"GooglePinterestDiggLinkedin Reddit Stumbleupon PrintDeliciousPocketTumblr
Despite all the scandals, unpresidential behavior, and ignorance, Republicans still support Donald Trump, and former RNC chairman Michael Steele is sick and tired of it.

Another shoe dropped in Donald Trump Jr’s email scandal on Friday morning, as NBC revealed that Trump Jr. actually met with a second Russian during his meeting with a Russian lawyer to get damaging information to use against Hillary Clinton. As it turns out, Trump Jr. lied when he told Sean Hannity that his emails represented “everything” on his contacts with Russia, because an ex-Soviet intelligence official was at the meeting as well. In short, there two Russians at the meeting and one is deeply connected to the former Soviet Union. Ronald Reagan is now rolling in his grave.
And Michael Steele isn’t very happy about it either.
During an appearance on MSNBC, Steele went off on Trump for continuing to drag Republicans into scandals, and then he ripped Republicans a new one for continuing to support Trump.
“I think it works along the lines of a general belief that no one will know what actually happened because there was no third party source to validate or corroborate who was in the meeting. But, you know, we have a press corps, we have individuals as we’ve learned in this administration who do like to talk. And that information gets out — the drip, drip, drip. I’ve said it now for six months, the drip, drip, drip from this campaign and now into this administration will be its death knell, and it rings every frigging day for the Republican Party, and they better wake their butts up.”
“They’re scared of one-tenth of 1 percent of a base that is lockstep with Donald Trump, and the leadership is frozen,” Steele continued. “They have cement around their feet and they refuse to move. They can’t get an agenda passed, seven years on health care? This is a joke. Infrastructure won’t happen, tax reform? Forget about it. Because the focus right now is on getting to the bottom of the crap that is building up around this administration that is weighing down the party. If they don’t wake up, there will be no party going into next year.”
Here’s the video via VidMe.
Indeed, 2018 is looking ever more precarious for the Republican Party as more and more Americans wake up to the realization that Trump is destroying the country and making America a laughingstock around the globe. It becomes clearer every day that Trump colluded with Russia and Putin to win the election. Trump should have been impeached and put behind bars already. But Republicans continue to protect Trump instead of doing their f*cking job, which is to protect the United States and the Constitution. It’s time for Republicans to stop putting party above what’s best for the country. That means they need to grow a spine and do the right thing. It’s time for Trump to go.

Trump Goes On Wild Wednesday Morning Rant Like An Uncontrollable Evil Clown,"Carissa House-Dunphy-July 5, 2017
Trump gets himself into a lot of hot water with his Twitter account but, out of sheer defiance, refuses to give up tweeting his every stray thought on social media.

Trump’s travel plans are already well-known to the public since news organizations are aware of these details and report on them accordingly. This particular trip has been much discussed, as Trump will meet his friend, Vladimir Putin, for the first time. After eight months of an investigation into Trump’s relationships and alleged collusion with Russian intelligence operatives, a meeting between Trump and Putin is something most Americans are aware of and already will be paying attention to.
Trump’s other tweets regarding foreign policy and trade are problematic, but simply working out any foreign policy stance on social media is alarming. Trump’s criticism of all other presidents before him, those who made all the “worst Trade Deals,” is insulting and more evidence of Trump’s inflated ego and feelings of superiority, but his criticism of China is awkward and ignores a piece of the presidency that Trump can’t seem to get a handle on: diplomacy.
Twitter users reacted with scorn for Trump’s continued Twitter rants.

A Leading Republican Just Rage-Quit the GOP (VIDEO),"July 11, 2017Samantha Layne News
One Republican Is Kissing His Party Good-Bye
MSNBC host and former GOP Congressman Joe Scarborough is leaving the Republican party and becoming an Independent.
Scarborough made the announcement during an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.
“I am a Republican but I’m not gonna be a Republican anymore,” Scarborough said. “I’m gonna become an Independent.”
The Conservative host has long since voiced disgust with President Trump. And his disgust now spills over onto other members within the Republican party he has long loved, because they are complicit in much of what makes Trump so horrible.
The moment came when Colbert asked Joe Scarborough why other Republicans haven’t changed their attitudes towards Donald Trump, like Scarborough did.
“What do you think is happening within your own party?” Colbert asked.
“I think it’s inexplicable,” Scarborough replied. However, Joe said, the Republican party’s betrayal of their “core values” began long before the election of Donald Trump. He pointed back to Donald Trump’s first embrace of a ban against Muslims, in December of 2015. He himself could never vote for someone, he explained, who sought to ban people based “on the God they worship.”
Scarborough appears next to his co-host and fiance Mika Brzezinski. Both have long since been the focus of Donald Trump’s ire. Recently, Trump lashed out at the two in a series of tweets, referring to Scarborough as “Psycho Joe” and to Brzezinski as “low-I.Q. Crazy Mika.” He then made a bizarre claim about Mika, saying she “was bleeding badly from a face-lift” when he saw her last year.
It’s Been A Long Time Coming
A look at Scarborough’s Twitter feed is enough to see his beliefs – and his open disgust for his once-beloved Republican party.
“The Republican Party I was born into and worked in for two decades is nearly gone.”

Paul Manafort Targeted In New FBI Probe,"Trouble keeps mounting for Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort.
Manafort and his son-in-law, Jeffrey Yohai, are both being investigated by the FBI for money used to finance luxury homes and apartments in New York and California.
Yohai, who married Manafort’s daughter Jessica in 2013, formed shell companies to purchase luxury properties in the Hollywood Hills with money from Manafort. Hacked text messages stolen from the phone of Manafort’s other daughter, Andrea, reveal that Paul Manafort had a “50/50” stake in the company with Yohai, and that Andrea Manafort suspected her brother-in-law was running a Ponzi scheme.
“Her hubby is running a Ponzi scheme,” Andrea Manafort wrote in the hacked texts. “I’m sure of it.”
Yohai was accused of running a Ponzi scheme in 2016 in a lawsuit filed by Guy Aroch, a fashion photographer who says he invested $2.9 million in Yohai and Manafort’s business, according to the report. Yohai denied the accusations in a court filing.
Yohai also managed to entangle some celebrity support.
Dear Lefty Media: Democrats are Still Unpopular in the Suburbs
Dustin Hoffman, and his son, Jacob, are said to have invested around $3 million in the venture.
Aroch’s lawsuit accuses Yohai of creating a “web of dozens of limited liability companies” to repay investors with new money from newer investors to give the illusion of quick returns on investments.
According to the report, it’s unclear whether the FBI investigation into these financial transactions is related to the broader FBI probe into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Many of Manafort’s real estate purchases were related to his lobbying work for a Russian-backed political party in Ukraine.
The games rich people play.
It doesn’t seem that this will have any bearing on the broader investigation that involves Manafort and his Russian connections. That’s my initial impression.
Manafort, however, just seems to have a problem with keeping his name unsullied by corrupt deals.",RedState,1
Immigrants trapped in tractor-trailer shared one air hole,"July 25 (UPI) -- Immigrants trapped in the back of a sweltering tractor-trailer in Texas said they shared one air hole and banged on the trailer's walls to try to get the driver's attention.
Investigators said that based on interviews with the survivors, more than 100 people were inside the trailer as it reached 100 degrees outside.
When the truck stopped in San Antonio on Sunday and the doors were opened, eight people were dead and dozens others were injured, some of whom have ""irreversible brain damage,"" the San Antonio fire chief said. Two others died after hospitalization.
Still more ran into the woods near the Walmart parking lot where the vehicle stopped.
The driver of the truck, James Matthew Bradley, appeared in federal court Monday on charges he illegally transported immigrants for financial gain, resulting in death.
Bradley didn't enter a plea in court, saying he was unaware anyone was inside the trailer until he stopped at the Walmart in San Antonio to use the restroom. That's when he opened the doors to the trailer and ""was run over by Spanish people and knocked to the ground.""
He said he saw ""bodies just lying on the floor like meat.""
When police arrived at the parking lot, an officer found ""multiple people standing and laying at and around the rear of the trailer,"" a criminal complaint against Bradley said.
The court document said Bradley told an officer he had been transporting the trailer from Schaller, Iowa, to Brownsville, Texas, for his boss to sell to a new owner, but he was unaware of the delivery address. Later he said he was traveling from San Antonio to Laredo, Texas.",United Press International – US,0
Is It Still a Muslim Ban if Christian Refugees Are Punished?,"The scene in Detroit’s U.S. District Court on June 21 was buzzing with anger and anxiety. Dozens of Iraqi nationals waited to hear whether their detained relatives, and other members of their Detroit community, would be deported back to Iraq. A rally outside the courtroom brought together hundreds of supporters, who came out with signs that read “Trump/Pence hear us, we voted for you” and “Deporting Christians to Iraq is genocide.”
Earlier in June, one of the largest Iraqi Christian populations in the world outside of Iraq was ambushed by raids conducted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Officials knocked on front doors, disrupting Sunday breakfasts and preparations to attend church, to arrest approximately 114 people in the greater Detroit area. Some of those arrested are Muslim, but the vast majority belong to Christian communities of either Chaldean or Assyrian ancestry. All those arrested were taken to jail and slated to board the next available flight back to their native Iraq — a country from which they once escaped.
According to immigration officials, ICE officers were simply processing a backlog of some 1,444 Iraqi nationals living in the United States who had at some point in their lives committed a crime. The ICE Detroit field office said each detainee already faced a final removal order from an immigration judge. By executing their deportation, ICE was addressing a security threat.
But the 121,000-strong Chaldean community in Detroit was shocked and outraged. Christians have long been a minority group in Iraq, often brutally persecuted for their religious beliefs. They first arrived in Detroit in the early 20th century due to the appeal of auto industry jobs. The population continued to grow as refugees fled Iraq after the first Gulf War and during Saddam Hussein’s rule. Since 2014 and the rise of the Islamic State, Christians have fled in even greater numbers. Former Secretary of State John Kerry said last year that the Islamic State was engaging in genocide against Christians, and in January, President Donald Trump promised to prioritize the resettlement of Christian refugees from the Middle East. Trump’s assurances of the security of their co-religionists caused many members of the Chaldean community in Detroit to vote for him last November.
Many are now wondering why the Trump administration is suddenly targeting Iraqi Christians for deportation. Most of the detainees were subject to final orders of removal, but the government permitted them to reside in the community under ICE supervision for years, even decades. Many of the detainees were considered to be rehabilitated for their past crimes and productive members of society — so why the sudden change?
One theory is that the White House is deliberately targeting Christians in order to gain an advantage in the upcoming judicial review of President Trump’s most recent executive order known as the “travel ban” or “Muslim ban,” which suspended the entry of foreign nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen into the country because of heightened terrorism risks.
Considering the discriminatory statements made by President Trump during his presidential campaign and the predominately Muslim character of the designated countries listed, several federal courts granted injunctions and temporarily halted the execution of the travel ban. On June 26, however, the Supreme Court announced that it will hear oral arguments on the case in October. In the meantime, the justices revived parts of the ban barring people from the six listed countries who have no relationship to an American person or entity. But the Trump administration requested a Supreme Court review of the case back in March and anticipated a thorough examination of any possible anti-Muslim priorities. Targeting Iraqi Christians with prior removal orders would help the travel ban pass constitutional muster, showing that there was no discriminatory intent against Muslims.
“ICE was intentionally targeting our community,” said Nathan Kalasho, an advocate in Detroit helping the detained Chaldeans obtain legal representation. “The Trump administration is trying to stick to their guns that their roundups of immigrants are based on criminal records and previous deportation orders. But the revised travel ban is tied up in courts, and Christian Iraqis are now collateral damage at another attempt to legitimize the travel ban.”
Kalasho said it’s no coincidence the raids occurred on a Sunday — when ICE officials knew many people could be found in church.
One bitter irony of the raids is that if it weren’t for recent political negotiations between Baghdad and Washington, Iraqi nationals in the country would not be at risk of deportation. Iraq only recently agreed to repatriate citizens. In exchange, the administration dropped Iraq from the original list of countries banned by Trump’s executive order. Previously, Iraq refused to issue travel documents to deported Iraqis, and therefore ICE was not able to execute removal orders.
The other side of the argument is that Trump had no intention to specifically go after Iraqi Christians, but sending people back to a hostile home country is the result of the president’s pledge to curb illegal immigration. In February, the Department of Homeland Security broadened the criteria for who is considered a priority for deportation. Previously, ICE could only target undocumented immigrants who had been convicted of a crime. Now, individuals who have “committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense” are deportable. In this specific incident, all of the detainees were ordered removed to Iraq years ago, but not all have a criminal background — some simply overstayed their visas.
ICE is under pressure not only to arrest more people but also to report the statistics of increased enforcement to the American public. In an official announcement, ICE stated that since January, more than 41,000 individuals were arrested — a 37.6 percent increase over the same period in 2016. The arrests of undocumented immigrants with no criminal record also more than doubled in this same time period. There are currently 1,444 Iraqis who have received their final deportation orders — an easy way for ICE to boost its numbers further. Many of these Iraqis are now in hiding, too scared to even show up to work because ICE agents might be waiting for them.
ICE argues that the detainees are hardened criminals. However, attorneys for the Iraqi nationals — a team of lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, CODE Legal Aid, and the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center (MIRC) — say the crimes are relatively minor and took place years ago, followed by years, and in some cases decades, of law-abiding behavior. One of the petitioners subject to deportation is Jihan Asker, a 41-year-old mother of three children, all U.S. citizens. She has lived in the United States since she was 5. She pled under advisement to misdemeanor fraud in 2003, paid a fine of $150, and served six months’ probation. She has lived in the community — complying with an order of supervision with ICE — since 2008. The lawyers added that even for the petitioners with more serious criminal histories, the conditions in Iraq toward Christians counsel against haste in removing them.
U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith in Detroit issued a stay of removal for the 114 Iraqis until July 6. The judge wrote in his opinion that if the deportation orders were carried out, the petitioners would suffer “irreparable harm” and a “significant chance of loss of life.” This hold also extends to the 1,444 Iraqis nationwide, including people who have not yet been detained but are at risk. By July 6, the judge will decide whether or not the federal court has jurisdiction to hear the case and if the government can pursue deportations of all 1,444 Iraqis at risk nationwide.
Ruby Robinson, an attorney with MIRC, explained that there are several tracks attorneys and advocates are pursuing to protect those at risk of deportation.
“The stay order bought the petitioners some time to file motions to reopen their cases in immigration court, where an immigration judge will decide on the validity of an individual’s persecution claim,” he said.
Most of the outstanding removal orders are decades old and do not take into account changed circumstances in Iraq, including the rise of militant Islamist groups. These recent developments give those detained and slated for deportation a new basis for asylum in the United States. Without giving them the right to present their fears to a judge, the U.S. government is prohibited from removing them to a country where they are more likely than not to face persecution
Motions to reopen removal cases are time- and resource-intensive applications, Robinson explained. “We are encouraging people to seek their own counsel to file these motions while we wait to see how the federal judge will proceed with the class action lawsuit,” he said.
There’s also a political track — one that involves speaking with policymakers and working with officials in Washington to get some kind of pardon for the Iraqis. The Chaldean Community Foundation has reached out to congressional leaders, and several members of Congress have signed letters to DHS Secretary John Kelly requesting a halt to the deportations. Attorneys also appealed to Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder to consider pardons for those with state felonies.
No matter the government’s intention, the enforcement of Iraqi deportation orders reflects the consequences of Trump’s policies on immigration. The United States is not only under an obligation to halt any deportations of people who will return to a high likelihood of persecution — the zeal to bolster arrest numbers is straining an already overburdened immigration court system. Much like the travel ban, there has been far too much time spent litigating misguided orders. The administration would be better off hiring more judges to tackle the nearly 600,000 cases pending in immigration courts rather than turning its back on longtime American residents.",Foreign Policy,0
BREAKING: Trump Forced To Publicly Admit Obama Was RIGHT,"Donald Trump hates anything that has Obama’s name attached to it, so imagine how furious he is right now after being strong-armed into admitting that Obama was RIGHT on the Iran nuclear deal. After literally being FORCED by his national security team to relent, Trump’s begrudgingly re-certified Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran.
According to MSNBC, “Donald Trump had an hour-long meeting with his top national security advisers last week, including the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the White House National Security Advisor, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They all told the president the same thing: he needs to preserve the international nuclear agreement with Iran.”
So what did Trump do during this hour-long meeting? Well, of course, he spent 55 minutes bickering about how he didn’t want to re-certify OBAMA’S deal.
In a win for the American people and for the people of the world, though, Trump’s national security team wouldn’t take “no” for an answer. Trump recertified the deal, in effect telling the whole world that Obama’s Iranian deal was a success that IS working.
Trump isn’t happy about this development one bit—he knows just how incredibly weak and hypocritical it makes him look, regardless of it being absolutely the right decision. Just look back on Trump’s campaign rhetoric and you’ll realize just how humiliated he must be right now:
“Just one month into his candidacy, he said the Iran deal ‘poses a direct national security threat,’” MSNBC reports. “Two weeks later, Trump added that the international agreement ‘will go down as one of the dumbest [and] most dangerous misjudgments ever entered into in [the] history of our country.’ After wrapping up the GOP nomination, he went so far as to say the deal is likely to ‘lead to nuclear holocaust.’”
Welp, there’s certainly been no nuclear holocaust so far. And there won’t be one for the foreseeable future, either, since Trump’s just signed what he’s previously called the “dumbest” deal ever.
Trump’s just mad that Obama was right and he’s been wrong. Seriously, this is coming from the guy who had the U.S. military come up with a new plan for Syria after their first proposal was “too similar” to Obama’s Syria strategy.
Trump’s as hypocritical and spiteful as they come. Thank goodness that his national security team was FINALLY able to talk some sense into him.
Obama’s Iranian deal is what diplomacy actually looks like. Trump would be wise to continue emulating Obama’s winning style.
POLL: Is Trump totally incompetent?
Where do you stand? Do you think it’s ridiculous that Trump’s national security team had to DEMAND Trump to re-sign the Iran deal?
Please participate in our poll below and let us know what you think! It’s noble and just to speak up in dark days like these!
Enough is enough. Donald Trump’s hypocritical presidency has been one long nightmare that’s tanking America’s credibility and integrity with each passing second.
We the People deserve so much better than this. And it’s time to deliver Congress back to the Democrats so we can show Trump what accountability REALLY looks like.

"VIDEO: The Most Inspiring Thing You’ll See This Week Is ‘Storm,’ the Dog, Saving a Baby Deer","July 18, 2017July 18, 2017 Christopher Kemmett 0 Comments
“Bring him in, bring him in,” owner Mark Freeley can be heard on cellphone video, coaching his English Golden Retriever, Storm, who sprinted into Long Island Sound to save a drowning baby deer — garnering hero status the very second video was posted online.
“Storm just plunged into the water and started swimming out to the fawn, grabbed it by the neck, and started swimming to shore,” Freeley told People Magazine — noting ‘even he was surprised by his dog’s behavior.’
Apparently so worried for the suffering animal, Storm rushed into the waters off Port Jefferson, New York, grabbed the deer gently but firmly by the neck, and fought his way back to the shore — where the heroic dog ran with its patient far from the water’s edge.
When Storm laid the fawn down, it remained unresponsive — so the dog began nudging the tiny deer around the face and neck, in an obvious attempt to revive it.
Although video ends at this point, Freeley told the media his pooch’s nudges indeed stirred the fawn back to life; and — spooked by the large canine and the gathering crowd of onlookers — sprinted back into the water.
At that point, he, Frank Floridia of Strong Island Rescue, and his partner, Erica Kutznig, rushed into the water, formed a human chain — and, once again, rescued the fawn who refuses to believe it isn’t a fish.
After ultimately securing a lasso around the deer — and a full eight minutes of struggling — the group understood Storm’s fortitude, and pulled the animal to safety.
“I don’t think I could’ve done it without the help of my partner. At this point, I was exhausted. My knee blew out, and I collapsed on the beach,” Florida said, adding his wife brought the fawn to their van, and transported it to a local wildlife agency.
Despite a massive tick infestation and eye injury — and time spent in the water — the tiny deer is expected to make a full recovery.

Chip and Joanna Gaines of HGTV’s ‘Fixer Upper’ Help Paralyzed Waco Firefighter,"My favorite show these days by far is HGTV’s Fixer Upper with Chip and Joanna Gaines. Not only are they fun, they represent what American values used to be. They are Christians and by all accounts are kind hearted and live their faith. Expanding on that premise, they are doing something remarkable for a firefighter that was hurt there in McGregor, Texas recently.
Garth Goodwin has never met the dynamic couple, but on his off-duty hours, he had a job helping to assemble the billboards they use to reveal the completion of renovated homes to people lucky enough to be their clients. By extension, he was part of their team. Goodwin had just left working on a sign for the Gaines and had gone to another job in McGregor to work on a billboard. Somehow, he fell when a metal pole came into contact with a power line. He was thrown 13 or 14 feet and laid there for an hour and a half until someone found him. He was paralyzed from the chest down.
WACO, Texas (KWTX) Chip and Joanna Gaines, the stars of HGTV’s popular “Fixer Upper,” have quietly stepped in to ensure that work can start soon on a handicap-accessible home for an injured Waco firefighter.
“Chip and Joanna have offered to pick up the last big ticket item,” said contractor Wes Waller of UBI Products, who has teamed up with local firefighters to build the home for Waco firefighter Garth Goodwin and his family.
“They’re going to pay for the cost of the lumber.”
The contribution means that ground will be broken for the home next week in Moody with the goal of finishing the house and moving the Goodwin family in by Thanksgiving.
Goodwin doesn’t know the couple, but on his off-duty job he has helped assemble the rolling billboards that the couple pulls apart to reveal renovated homes as they ask the owners, “Ready to see your fixer upper?”
In fact on May 10 Goodwin had just completed work on a “Fixer Upper” billboard project when he stopped in McGregor to work on the billboard from which he fell after a metal pole came into contact with a power line.
The Goodwin family had already had their share of hard times with their only child, Cutter, 19, having been born without a portion of his brain and requiring around-the-clock care. I assume that is why Garth was working extra jobs as any good father would. Now he fears being a burden on his family. Waco firefighters got together with contractor Wes Waller and went about planning to build the Goodwins a handicap-accessible home. Waco residents and businesses donated money and other resources needed to make the Goodwin home a reality. More than 70 different businesses and contractors offered to help and the Baylor softball team even promised to clean the house up before the family moves in, Waller said.
When Chip and Joanna found out that the firefighters and Waller still needed lumber for the renovation, they offered to donate it. “Chip and Joanna have offered to pick up the last big ticket item,” Waller said. “They’re going to pay for the cost of the lumber.” Waller continued, “It’s just like that picture in the restaurant where you’re working to connect the dots. Chip and Joanna connected the dots for us.”
The Gaines have put Waco back on the map with their hard work, faith and success. But what they are best known for is their charitable spirit and kindness. Waco firefighter Jay Jeffrey told KWTX: “All of us at the Waco Fire Department are thankful for Chip and Joanna and everyone that has stepped up to help our friend and his family. The positive impact they are making for Garth, Lisa and Cutter is immeasurable,” he said.
Evidently the Gaines don’t just renovate homes… they change lives for the better and bless them for it. If you want to donate to the GoFundMe.com account for the Goodwin family… you can go here. They still need help covering their medical bills.",Ihavethetruth,1
Elon Musk: regulate AI to combat 'existential threat' before it's too late,"Tesla and SpaceX CEO says AI represents a ‘fundamental risk to human civilisation’ and that waiting for something bad to happen is not an option
Elon Musk urges for proactive regulation of AI to help prevent the risk of the ‘existential threat’
 
Tesla and SpaceX CEO says AI represents a ‘fundamental risk to human civilisation’ and that waiting for something bad to happen is not an option
Monday 17 July 2017 06.00 EDT
Tesla and Space X chief executive Elon Musk has pushed again for the proactive regulation of artificial intelligence because “by the time we are reactive in AI regulation, it’s too late”.
Speaking at the US National Governors Association summer meeting in Providence Rhode Island, Musk said: “Normally the way regulations are set up is when a bunch of bad things happen, there’s a public outcry, and after many years a regulatory agency is set up to regulate that industry.
“It takes forever. That, in the past, has been bad but not something which represented a fundamental risk to the existence of civilisation.”
Musk has previously stated that AI is one of the most pressing threats to the survival of the human race, and that his investments into its development were made with the intention of keeping an eye on its development.
“AI is the rare case where I think we need to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive. Because I think by the time we are reactive in AI regulation, it’ll be too late,” Musk told the meeting. “AI is a fundamental risk to the existence of human civilisation.”
Elon Musk interviewed as part of the NGA Ahead of the Curve initiative.
While Musk has repeatedly shared his worries over AI and its development that is seen as inevitable in some regard, words appeared to hit home with multiple governors of the 32 taking part in the meeting, with follow-up questions looking for suggestions for how to go about regulating AI’s development. Musk suggested that the first stage would be to “learn as much as possible” to better understand the problem.
Musk also talked about electric and self-driving cars, saying that at some stage having a non-autonomous vehicle intended for travel rather than recreation would be considered strange and that the biggest threat to autonomous cars would be a hack of the software to take control of a fleet of connected vehicles.

The Rise of Hyper-Realistic Sex Robots and the End of Humanity,"July 26, 2017July 26, 2017 Christopher Kemmett 0 Comments
It is becoming apparent that technology is beginning to replace humans in the work force. This alone is on the verge of creating some of the most difficult problems that our society has been faced with over the past century, but what might be even more troubling is the rise of hyper-realistic sex robots.
As part of a major deal with a factory in China, a Barcelona scientist named Dr. Sergi Santos has just announced the release of a new robot which he describes as “very human” and plans to sell to “every shop” in a global “revolution”. Despite being describe as a “danger to humanity,” he still plans on rolling out his product and now has the resources to do so.
He says that the robots will cost about $3,923, or £3,000 each when they reach retail districts and the funds will allow him to produce a minimum of 50 robots per week.
What we will have will be completely exact to a human’s behavior and looks… The emergence of each product will bring some changes in people’s lives.
Sex Robots A Dangerous Trend
Replacing human connectivity with robots clearly presents itself with problems involving reproduction and motivation. A PSA from the show Futurama called “Don’t Date Robots” explains why this may spell out danger for society, and even though it was primarily meant to be a comedy piece, it was years ahead of its time in calling out the rise of sexual automation.
A study from Responsible Robotics shows that as humanity’s natural desire for intimacy become fulfilled by robots, we develop a loneliness and an inability to form relationships with other human beings. In addition, researchers are finding that sex robots may make the world a much more dangerous place for women by romanticizing a lack of consent.
Another terrifying aspect of artificial intelligence is the capability for unwitting surveillance. Back in April, WikiLeaks revealed that the CIA was using its own software known as “Weeping Angel” to hack into smart TV’s in order to spy on American citizens in their homes. If people were to allow hackable humanoid robotics into their homes, it would create a whole new level of surveillance and manipulation which George Orwell couldn’t even imagine.
With the support of Sergi, we want to bring sex robots into human life and allow them to become real family members. – Tian, Partner of Sergi Santos
When asking Amazon’s Alexa, an Amazon-created robot which is designed to sit at home and answer any questions, about whether or not she is connected to the CIA, she gives the response that she has no answer to the question – and if asked if she works for the CIA, her response is “No, I work for Amazon.” However, it is widely known that back in 2014 Amazon signed a shady, low-key contract with the CIA for a cloud service which totaled $600 Million.
It took a lot of wrangling, but it was easy to see the vision if you laid it all out…We decided we needed to buy innovation. – Former Intelligence Official
Of course, robots are starting to encroach on more than just our home lives. One of the most alarming aspects of artificial intelligence is their ability to perform job tasks better and cheaper than humans. With all of this to consider, the time has come to have a global discussion about how much technology is allowed to replace our current human systems and intrude upon our lives. The future is not set in stone which means we still have the opportunity to accept or refuse any technology which we deem less than beneficial to our lives.

Rex Tillerson Next In Line To Quit After Trump’s Harsh Attacks On Jeff Sessions,"Multiple sources report that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is considering submitting his resignation to President Trump. He is allegedly growing frustrated with the Trump administration in part, due to the way President Trump is now treating Attorney General Jeff Sessions, which Tillerson feels is “unprofessional.” But “unprofessional” is code word for something else in the context of this situation; disloyalty.
Sources “familiar with Tillerson conversations with friends outside Washington”, report that Tillerson’s frustration with Trump started boiling over after Trump said he regretted hiring Jeff Sessions. Trump must have made Tillerson feel even worse today, as this morning Trump called Sessions “beleaguered” and lashed out at Sessions for not looking into Hillary Clinton’s “crimes.”
Tillerson’s frustration with Trump has been building from the start of Trump’s administration. Last month, Jared Kushner himself called Tillerson “unprofessional” and Tillerson “blew up” at top Trump administration staffers during a meeting with Reince Priebus, confirmed by four different sources to Politico.
Tillerson has also been consistently undermined and back handed by Trump, as Trump rejected a number of his hiring decisions and completely left him out of the loop after Trump first implemented his Muslim travel ban. Trump has also contradicted Tillerson’s public statements about how the US should deal with disputes between Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
This report from “Tillerson’s friends” seems credible, as previous reports have indicated Tillerson was shouted at and cursed out by Trump months ago, along with Tillerson’s heated exchanges with Trump admin staffers. There have been enough reports on Tillerson’s relationship with Trump, to draw the conclusion that he is indeed unhappy.
Add to this, that Tillerson was found to have violated U.S. sanctions against Russia while working as CEO of Exxon Mobil last week. Tillerson is probably speaking in code when he says he is unhappy with how “unprofessional” Trump acts. How could he expect a p***y grabber to ever be professional? “Unprofessional” in this context is code-word for “disloyal”, as Trump is showing no loyalty to anyone but himself, especially by attacking his longest supporter, Jeff Sessions.
Trump is being completely disloyal to the people who were, and are, loyal to him. That’s a big problem. It is going to further splinter an already dysfunctional White House. Everyone is going to retreat into their own corner and cover their own butts. That’s the environment that Tillerson knows is coming, and he’s obviously weighing whether it’s worth his time to stay in that mess.
Along with all of this on Tillerson’s mind, is all that sweet oil locked up in Russia due to sanctions. With Congress looking to up the sanctions on Russia, and tie Trump’s tiny hands from being able to do anything about it, Tillerson’s ambition to serve (himself/Exxon) is gone.

The Trump Administration’s Own Data Says Obamacare Isn’t Imploding,"Welcome to TrumpBeat, FiveThirtyEight’s weekly feature on the latest policy developments in Washington and beyond.

President Trump and other Republicans have said repeatedly that one reason they have to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act is that the law is failing: Healthy people are abandoning the insurance marketplaces set up by the law, driving up costs and leading yet more people to drop insurance — a so-called “death spiral.” Many health insurance experts, however, have argued that those fears are overblown, and they recently got support from an unlikely source: the Trump administration itself.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, last week released a report about a wonky aspect of the Affordable Care Act related to insurance payments. Tucked away in the report, however, was evidence that the health insurance marketplaces set up by Obamacare were relatively stable in 2016. Contrary to the “death-spiral” narrative, the CMS report found that the mix of healthy and sick people buying insurance on the Obamacare marketplaces in 2016 was surprisingly similar to those who enrolled in 2015.
Explaining what CMS found requires a dip in the sea of the actuarial terminology, so take a deep breath, we’ll be back up for air shortly. The report looked, in part, at so-called risk-adjustment payments, which are part of the ACA’s system for encouraging insurers to enroll high-cost patients. This system is meant to prevent insurers from cherry-picking the healthiest people on the market by collecting money from plans with healthier enrollees to distribute to plans that have people with higher health care costs. (Another type of payment discussed in the report, known as reinsurance, serves a similar purpose through a different mechanism: The government effectively covers part of the cost of patients with very expensive health needs.)
To determine the mix of healthy and sick enrollees for risk-adjustment payments, the federal government assigns risk scores to people based on their age, sex and health diagnosis and then averages the scores for a plan. What CMS found was that those averages were relatively stable in 2016. That’s a good sign for the marketplaces, because stabilizing the mix of healthy and sick people buying on the marketplaces goes a long way toward stabilizing prices. Despite expectations that in the face of rising premiums, healthier enrollees would be less inclined to enroll last year, that doesn’t appear to have been the case.
That doesn’t mean the marketplaces are working for everyone. There are millions of people who don’t qualify for subsidies, face high prices in the private market and likely haven’t enrolled in insurance as a result. That’s a problem that needs solving, but it’s a different problem than the marketplaces being in a death spiral.
More health care: CHIP on the block?
While Congress has been debating plans to partially repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, a lot of other legislation has been put on hold. Some of the delays have concerned things the Republicans in charge want to deal with, such as tax reform. But progress has also stalled on some things that Congress has to deal with. In the latter category is whether to renew funding for a program that provides health insurance to nearly 9 million children in the United States.
The Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, was created in 1997 as a way to get health insurance to children whose families earned too much to qualify for Medicaid but whose incomes were small enough that it would be difficult to purchase insurance outright. Around 8.9 million children1 were insured through CHIP at some point in 2016, according to government estimates. The program is administered by the states but partly funded by the federal government. That federal funding is set to expire on Sept. 30, but Congress has so far put off dealing with it.
The last time the program’s funding came up for consideration in 2015, it was renewed for an additional two years under the same terms that the federal government had previously had with states. But this time around, CHIP renewal is hitting some snags: A Senate hearing that was supposed to begin the renewal process in May was canceled. Policy wonks, both conservative and liberal, have warned that Republicans could use the program as leverage to win Democratic votes on policies they would otherwise oppose — possibly including some health care changes if the Senate bill to repeal and replace the ACA is unsuccessful. It wouldn’t be the first time politicians had wrestled over the program.
State Medicaid directors, who also run CHIP in most states, were expressing concern about the slow renewal even before the May hearing was canceled. They wrote a letter to Congress in March asking that it commit to the funds; today, nearly all of the state legislatures have already adjourned for the year, meaning that states have few options to pay for the program if Congress doesn’t renew the funding or reduces how much the federal government contributes. None of this is to suggest that Republicans are likely to kill off the program: CHIP has had bipartisan support since its inception. They could, however, reduce the share of the bill paid for by the federal government, as Trump’s budget has proposed, forcing states to make tough choices about how many children are enrolled in the program in the process. One thing that’s certain is that lots of things are on hold while Republicans try to follow through on their promise to repeal and replace the ACA.
President Trump has drawn criticism from education groups for proposing sharp cutbacks to education funding. But the government is getting plaudits for one move: restoring year-round Pell grants.
The federal Pell grant program helps cover tuition, fees and other costs for low-income students. About 7.6 million students — roughly one-third of undergraduates — received a Pell grant in 2015-16. But apart from a brief period several years ago, Pell grants typically haven’t been available for more than two semesters a year — meaning students who hoped to graduate early, or who needed to take summer classes, often had to borrow money to do so.
In June, however, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced the return of year-round Pell grants, starting July 1. Under the new policy, Pell grant recipients who are enrolled at least half-time can receive up to 150 percent of their standard two-semester grant over the course of an academic year, meaning they will be able to use the grants to pay for summer classes. The new policy doesn’t change the Pell program’s lifetime cap of 12 semesters of aid. About 1 million students would benefit from the program, Politico and The Washington Post reported.
Education advocates have long argued that restoring the year-round Pell program is key to boosting low graduation rates among low-income students. While the national graduation rate hovers around 59 percent, only 45 percent of low-income students graduate in six years.2 Research has found that helping students graduate quickly is key to their success: The longer students spend in college, the less likely they are to graduate. Spending more time in school is expensive, too. Factoring in lost wages, the cost of each additional year after the first four amounts to $68,153, according to Complete College America, a research and advocacy group.
But while education experts praised the return to year-round Pell grants, they said there are some limitations to the program. The budget deal that restored the program didn’t include extra money to pay for it; instead, it took $1.3 billion out of existing Pell accounts. Trump’s proposed 2018 budget likewise provides money for year-round Pell grants but wouldn’t boost overall Pell funding. That could put pressure on the Pell budget at a time when the cost of college is rising. Jessica Thompson, research and policy director at the nonprofit research and advocacy group Institute for College Access and Success, said the Department of Education needs to do more to direct aid money to the students who need it most.
“Year-round Pell is one piece, but it is only one piece,” Thompson said.
Environmental policy: No easy way out
Last July, the Environmental Protection Agency made a formal determination that aircraft emissions contribute to climate change and endanger public health, setting in motion the process of creating new regulations on emissions from airplanes. The White House has changed hands since then, but the regulation process marches on: EPA officials told the trade publication InsideEPA last week that they still plan to issue a proposed rule by January and finalize it by the end of 2018.
If that seems a little odd, coming from an agency that’s also in the process of rolling back other greenhouse gas emissions rules and looking at cutting programs related to climate change, welcome to the weird world of regulatory law, which has put Scott Pruitt’s EPA in a strange position: publicly dubious of the idea that climate change is a real threat yet legally bound to treat climate change as a real threat.
This particular story begins back in 2007, when the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA had to determine where the science stood on climate change — was there enough evidence to say that greenhouse gases are a threat to public health or not? The EPA reviewed the evidence and found it convincing enough to issue a so-called endangerment finding, which basically means that the EPA has to treat greenhouse gases as a dangerous pollutant under the Clean Air Act. Today, that determination is causing all kinds of headaches for Pruitt’s EPA. That’s because the endangerment finding can’t easily be struck from the books. Among other challenges, you’d have to prove that the science it’s based on was wrong. The finding has already been challenged (unsuccessfully) in court and Pruitt has told both the White House and Congress that he won’t fight it.
The endangerment finding doesn’t mean the EPA is moving full speed ahead on greenhouse gas regulations, but it does make it harder to reverse the Obama administration’s policies. Rather than simply striking Obama-era rules from the books, for example, the EPA is contesting some of them on technical details. And even with this more focused approach, the administration is running into obstacles: On July 3, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down an EPA moratorium, announced earlier this year, that would have halted the implementation of an Obama-era methane regulation for two years. Pausing the implementation of regulation was easier, legally speaking, than dismantling it outright — a process that would have forced the EPA to either replace that regulation with another one or challenge the endangerment finding itself. But, the court ruled, the pause button can’t be used as an “arbitrary” and “capricious” means of boxing out regulations you don’t like. The endangerment finding is a chasm, and Pruitt just lost one of his best bridges across it.",Five Thirty Eight,0
"Suicide bombing in Kabul leaves 24 dead, dozens injured","KABUL — At least 24 people were killed in the latest violence to rock Afghanistan’s capital Monday morning when a suicide bomber struck near a minibus in the southwestern neighborhood of Dehbori.
Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danesh confirmed the death toll and said that about three dozen others were injured. Images shared on social media showed a street strewn with burning vehicles and debris, with smoke rising above.
The blast occurred not far from the residence of Mohammad Mohaqiq, Afghanistan’s most prominent politician from the Hazara ethnic minority. Dehbori is home to many Hazaras.
According to ABC News, a witness said the attacker drove his car into a minibus. “The sound was very strong. The ground shook,” said the witness, a store owner named Mohammed Nader.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the attack targeted an employee of a “spy agency.”
Exactly one year ago, a massive bombing in Kabul killed 80, mostly Hazaras who were marching to demand better infrastructure in areas of the country where they represent the majority. A commemorative march had been planned for Monday but was canceled Sunday, ostensibly because President Ashraf Ghani had agreed to meet the protest leaders and consider their demands.
Hazaras have long been victimized as an ethnic and religious minority. Most Hazaras are Shiites, while Afghanistan is overwhelmingly Sunni.

"BREAKING: Trump Announces Made In America Week, But There’s Just 1 HUGE Problem","The White House is celebrating Made in America week to highlight U.S. manufacturing. The only trouble is, Donald Trump isn’t at all familiar with U.S. manufacturing.
Donald Trump very rarely comes into contact with items that were actually made in America—at least as far as his own businesses are concerned. For while he likes to preach from the campaign trail and the Oval Office that American-made is the only way to go, as a businessman he has taken the complete opposite approach.
Don’t look for the “Made in America” label on Trump brand items. Because you could go blind trying to find it.
Everything that Trump sells and surrounds himself with is foreign-made—almost exclusively. That’s because when it comes to his own products that he sells to others, he forgets all about American manufacturing.
Unless, you know, it’s time to make a speech about it.
Trump’s clothes aren’t made in America. The Donald J. Trump Collection includes everything from eyeglasses to dress shirts to entire suits, and they’re made in countries like Vietnam, Honduras, China and Bangladesh.
Meanwhile, the Trump Home collection starts out very far from your home. Many Trump Home products are manufactured in Turkey, China and Germany.
Trump’s hotels are likewise filled with products that weren’t made here. The Trump Hotel pens were made in either Taiwan or China. Bath towels, shampoo, body wash, shower caps, laundry bags, moisturizers and even the pet collars and pet leashes provided at Trump Hotels were all made in China.
And then there’s Trump Vodka, which comes from a distillery in the Netherlands.
Meanwhile, Ivanka Trump is absolutely no better. Her clothing line is made overseas. Ivanka shoes come from Hong Kong. Ivanka Trump jewelry also comes from overseas before it’s sold to women in the U.S.
If Trump wants to celebrate Made In America week, maybe he ought to start by familiarizing himself with some American-made products. He doesn’t seem to come into contact with them all too much, especially when you consider how much of his presidency he’s already spent on Trump properties.
The White House had a rather lackluster response to the media calling out this hypocrisy: “We’ll get back to you on that.”
Ivanka Trump exclusively uses foreign makers to create her products. In fact, her brand doesn’t sell a single U.S.-made item.
As for Trump, his record is just a bit better. You can count on one hand the items that he has sold that carried the Made in America label. The list includes the comforters at Trump Hotels. The other linens, however, are all foreign-made.
But as for “Made in America Week,” Trump is using it mostly to push his own agenda. The White House has already released statements about the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the North America Free Trade Agreement and other long-standing trade policies around the world that Trump wants to change.
How strange. A president who has refused to separate himself from his personal business interests—personal business interests that are largely overseas—wants to change the international trade agreements.
Made in America Week, indeed.
POLL: Is Trump a hypocrite?
Can you ever stand behind a president who touts American-made products while selling made-in-China products to people all over the U.S.?
But, there is one thing that Trump is right about. This week, we should support American-made stuff only. So this week, don’t buy or use anything at all with the Trump label on it.
After all, this week is all about American-made items—and Trump knows almost nothing about that.

The website YJC.ir, which is affiliated with Iranian state television, as well as the semi-official Fars news agency, also reported the launch on Thursday, saying it was successful.
The launch comes as the United States has criticized Iran's ballistic missile tests.
Such tests are allowed under the 2015 nuclear deal that Iran struck with world powers. However, American officials argue that they violate the spirit of the accord that saw the Islamic Republic limit its uranium enrichment program in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.
The proposed U.S. sanctions bill is having consequences, a Security Council diplomat told CBS News on Thursday. Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif lashed out at U.S. sanctions at a talk at the Council on Foreign Relations earlier this month, saying, ""the impact is that the United States doesn't learn from history,"" CBS News' Pamela Falk reports.
Iran has pursued a satellite launch program for years. The U.S. and its allies worry that the same technology could be used to develop long-range missiles.

NBC’s moderator of “Meet the Press” took umbrage at the Donald Trump administration’s ongoing battle with CNN.
“I’m obsessed with the White House’s war on the press and on media,” NBC News political director Chuck Todd explained. “Let’s be clear about this, that war is nothing less than a war on the truth.”
“Of course the White House attacks, delegitimize the media to create running room for it’s version of events,” Todd explained. “White House is not above using anonymous sources to criticize the use of anonymous sources.”
Todd then played video of White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders lashing out against CNN.
“There’s a video circulating now, whether it’s accurate or not, I don’t know, but I would encourage everyone in this room and frankly everybody across the country to take a look at it,” Sanders advised. “I think if it is accurate, it’s a disgrace to all of media, to all of journalism.”
“Excuse me?” Todd said, raising his voice. “I don’t know whether it is accurate or not, but go take a look at it because it disgraces you?”

Oregon Republican wants cognitively impaired couple to keep kids despite family’s concerns,"20 Jul 2017 at 11:27 ET
Amy Fabbrini and Eric Ziegler of Redmond, OR (Screen capture)
Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story!
The state of Oregon has denied two parents in the town of Redmond custody of their young sons because of the couple’s profound intellectual limitations.
According to an editorial at OregonLive.com, one state lawmaker is advocating for Amy Fabbrini and Eric Ziegler’s children to be returned to them from foster care — even as Fabbrini’s father works to ensure that his daughter is not left in charge of her sons.
Fabbrini’s second son was taken from her five months ago at birth, following her elder son Christopher into foster care. She has, according to state officials, a functioning IQ of 72. Christopher was born at home on Sep. 9, 2013, his arrival a complete shock to Fabbrini and Ziegler.
“Here and there I have kidney issues so I just thought I was having kidney issues, that’s what I associated the pain with,” Fabbrini said. “I was trying to go to sleep and trying to get comfortable … and I felt this weird pain down there.”
Christopher was born before paramedics arrived and mother and child were taken to the hospital in an ambulance.
Fabbrini’s father Raymond Fabbrini, 74, says his daughter is not a fit parent.
“She doesn’t have the instincts to be a mother,” he told OregonLive’s Samantha Swindler.
Fabbrini, 31, and Ziegler, 38, are both unemployed and live in a three-bedroom house owned by Ziegler’s parents, who live out of state.
Republican state Sen. Tim Knopp says he’s met with Ziegler and Fabbrini and says they seem like they’d be fine parents.
“My impression of them is that they were just like any other couple, and they were trying to be successful in life, just like anyone else would be, and they wanted to be together as a family,” Knopp said. “I didn’t see any issues when I met with them that would automatically disqualify them from being good parents.”
Fabbrini told Swindler that she is desperate to be a mother.
“I love kids, I was raised around kids, my mom was a preschool teacher for 20-plus years, and so I’ve always been around kids,” she said. “That’s my passion. I love to do things with kids, and that’s what I want to do in the future, something that has to do with kids.”
State records say, however, that when Ziegler and Fabbrini were briefly allowed to care for Christopher, Ziegler “slept with the baby on the floor and almost rolled over on him.” Ziegler — whose IQ is around 66, significantly lower than the average IQ of 100 — was also reported to be easily frustrated, absent-minded about feeding his dog, and has to be reminded to do simple things like wash his hands after using the toilet and to apply sunscreen to more of his body than his face.
Knopp, however, believes that for Oregon to deny the parents custody of their children is a form of government overreach.
“The state has a responsibility to help parents reunite with their children, and if there are issues that are keeping them from doing that, especially for people with disabilities, I believe that as a state, we should be supporting them and trying to help them stay together as families,” he told OregonLive. “In a case where there is no specific allegation of abuse or neglect, I think the state should be looking to be supportive of uniting families and not sending kids into foster care.”

Former Governor Bimal Jalan says inflation targeting cannot work in India,"Inflation targeting is fine for countries like the US and the UK says Bimal Jalan. (Reuters).
Former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Bimal Jalan today said that inflation targeting cannot work in India. He added that it is because prices depend on a range of factors like monsoon and oil prices over which neither the central bank nor the government has any control. In a report by PTI, Jalan said, “Inflation targeting is fine for countries like the US and the UK. But we (India) are dependent on rain, import of oil from Gulf countries. In India, there is no point in setting an inflation target.” The comments came at the launch of a book written by RBI Governor YV Reddy.
Speaking about the role of RBI in the process, he said, “What can the RBI do if food prices go up by 40 percent as a result of monsoon failure?” Under the new Monetary Policy Framework, the RBI aims to contain inflation at 4 per cent with a band of (+/-) 2 percent.
Earlier this year, Jalan in an interview to VCCircle an Indian information services group said that Inflation in India is on the lower side and growth is among the highest in the world. Talking on demonetisation he said that despite criticism of the demonetization policy the situation is positive. This positive situation in the present context facilitates the making of the budget.

The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, last week. His aides said it was unclear when a vote would be held on his health care bill.Credit Al Drago for The New York Times
WASHINGTON — A top Senate Republican vowed on Sunday to bring the party’s health care bill to a vote as soon as possible, even as detractors said they would use a delay caused by the absence of Senator John McCain to mobilize further opposition to the measure.
“I believe as soon as we have a full contingent of senators, that we’ll have that vote,” the No. 2 Senate Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
But questions emerged Sunday over when that might be. Mr. McCain, 80, had a craniotomy — a procedure in which doctors create an opening in the skull — on Friday to remove a blood clot above his left eye, and he is recovering at home in Arizona. A statement from his office had indicated that he would be out this week, but neurosurgeons not involved with Mr. McCain’s surgery said the recovery period for such a procedure was often longer.
“For most patients, the time to recover from a craniotomy is usually a few weeks,” said Dr. Nrupen Baxi, an assistant professor of neurosurgery at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City.

Mr. McCain’s surgeons are not giving interviews. His communications director, Julie Tarallo, said more information would be released when it became available.
Continue reading the main story
Aides to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said it was unclear how long the delay would last.
The timing of the Senate vote is crucial. The more it is delayed, the more likely the bill is to fail, supporters and opponents say. Moreover, the Senate schedule will soon be packed with other legislation, like an increase in the statutory limit on federal borrowing and spending bills for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. In addition, Republicans are eager to cut taxes and simplify the tax code.
The Senate has struggled to pass a health care bill, delaying a vote on a previous version of the legislation in June.
Several Republican senators have expressed reservations or outright opposition to the new version as well, and Republicans need Mr. McCain’s vote to have any chance of passing it.
The bill, to repeal and replace major provisions of the Affordable Care Act, is a top priority for President Trump and Republicans in the House, which passed its own repeal bill in early May.
Mr. Cornyn acknowledged that “there’s uncertainty about what the final outcome will be.” Asked what would happen if the bill did not pass, he said: “I assume we’ll keep trying. But at some point, if Democrats won’t participate in the process, then we’re going to have to come up with a different plan.”
Critics of the Senate’s health care bill, taking advantage of the delay, said Sunday that Republican leaders needed to rework the legislation in fundamental ways. Given the additional time, they said, Senate committees should hold hearings to solicit opinions from the public and from experts on health care and insurance.
“We should not be making fundamental changes in a vital safety net program that’s been on the books for 50 years, the Medicaid program, without having a single hearing to evaluate what the consequences are going to be,” Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”
Continue reading the main story
Roughly 20 million people have gained coverage through the Affordable Care Act, a pillar of President Barack Obama’s legacy. But Mr. Cornyn described the law on Sunday as a failed “exercise in central planning and command and control.”
The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, declined to comment beyond wishing Mr. McCain a quick recovery, as did Marc Lotter, a spokesman for Vice President Mike Pence. Mr. Trump has been urging lawmakers to pass the bill, saying he is waiting with pen in hand.
On Friday, Mr. Pence assured skeptical governors that “the Senate health care bill strengthens and secures Medicaid for the neediest in our society,” putting the program, which serves more than 70 million low-income people, on “a path to long-term sustainability.”
But Ms. Collins said: “I would respectfully disagree with the vice president’s analysis. This bill would impose fundamental, sweeping changes in the Medicaid program, and those include very deep cuts. That would affect some of the most vulnerable people in our society, including disabled children, poor seniors. It would affect our rural hospitals and our nursing homes. And they would have a very difficult time even staying in existence.”
She added, “There are about eight to 10 Republican senators who have serious concerns about this bill.”
Republicans hold 52 Senate seats, and all Democratic senators oppose the bill. Ms. Collins and Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, have said they will vote against even starting the debate, meaning all other Republican senators need to vote for the legislation if it is to pass.

Mr. Paul’s reasons for opposing the bill are very different from Ms. Collins’s; he says it retains too much of the Affordable Care Act. And he predicted that support for the legislation would erode because of the delay prompted by Mr. McCain’s absence.
“The longer the bill’s out there, the more conservative Republicans are going to discover that it’s not repeal,” he said Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “And the more that everybody’s going to discover that it keeps the fundamental flaw of Obamacare. It keeps the insurance mandates that cause the prices to rise, which chase young, healthy people out of the marketplace and leads to what people call adverse selection, where you have a sicker and sicker insurance pool and the premiums keep rising through the roof.”
Voters “elected us to repeal Obamacare,” Mr. Paul added. But with the bill drafted by Mr. McConnell, the senior senator from his home state, he said, “we’re going to keep most of the taxes, keep the regs, keep the subsidies and create a giant bailout superfund for the insurance companies.”
Continue reading the main story
The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, said Sunday that he did not think delaying the vote would change the outcome.
“Time is not the problem in the present health care bill,” Mr. Schumer said. “The problem is the substance. It slashes Medicaid, which has become something that helps middle-class New Yorkers — millions of them, literally — and millions of Americans.”
The delay gives critics of the repeal bill more time to investigate numbers being used by the Trump administration to defend it.
The administration has been telling Congress and governors that the bill includes plenty of money to provide private insurance for people who would lose Medicaid coverage. But those estimates are based on particular assumptions chosen by administration officials. Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada, a Republican, and others have questioned the validity of those assumptions.
The assumptions, made by political appointees in the Trump administration, specify how states would use money provided by the bill and how many people losing Medicaid would buy private insurance.
In a report on the House bill last month, the office of the actuary at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said most of the people who lost Medicaid coverage would “ultimately be uninsured, though a small fraction would choose to purchase individual insurance.”
Millions of people have gained coverage in the 31 states that chose to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and many of them are projected to lose that coverage under the Senate and House bills, which would roll back the expansion of Medicaid.
When Congress convened in January, Republicans appeared to be on course to repeal the Affordable Care Act within a month or two, but they met with growing resistance as lawmakers, consumers, doctors, hospitals and insurance companies scrutinized the proposals. Mr. McConnell delayed a vote scheduled for the week before the Fourth of July. Then, with no visible progress toward agreement, he delayed the Senate’s August recess by two weeks so senators could keep working.
Continue reading the main story
Administration officials will use the time provided by the latest delay to try to persuade undecided Republican senators to vote for the bill. They will also try to raise doubts about the work of the Congressional Budget Office, which estimated that an earlier version of Mr. McConnell’s bill could increase the number of uninsured Americans by 22 million by 2026, compared with current law.
The nonpartisan budget office had been expected to issue a report on the latest draft of the bill on Monday, but it now plans to take more time.
Lawmakers are eager to see what the office says about a proposal added to the bill last week in a bid for support from the most conservative Republican senators. Under the proposal, insurers could offer cheaper, less comprehensive health plans if they also offered three standard plans with all the benefits required by the Affordable Care Act.
The author of the proposal, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, said it would give consumers “the freedom to choose among more affordable plans” that were “free from Obamacare’s insurance regulations.”
The skimpier plans would cover less and presumably cost less, and insurers said they would also attract healthier people.
“These junk insurance plans could charge people more or simply deny them coverage based on pre-existing conditions,” said Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington.

Boston On Brink Of Civil War Over Muslims’ Huge Signs That Just Popped Up After White Woman Killed,"Muslims in America are becoming bolder than they ever have before as the threat of losing their “religious rights” and ultimately control is imminent under new leadership. With every heinous crime committed in this country by Muslims, their claim of assimilation and desire for equality is compromised. This has never been more the case than it is right now, about 36 hours after an innocent white woman was killed by a Somali Muslim cop in Minnesota who had no business wearing the badge. Rather than staying silent on the matter and proving they’re peaceful, Muslims in Massachusetts got loud, proud, and disgusting with what they blasted on massive billboards in Boston.
Islam was praised and protected for eight years under our former president and now their plan for complete domination over this country is slipping away. Fed-up with being feared after every terrorist attack, Muslims in Boston just fought back at concerned citizens and President Donald Trump with a massive message all around the busy public transit system that cannot be ignored. Now, it’s only a matter of time before civil war erupts in the streets there based on what the sign says.
President Trump is a Muslim’s worst nightmare since he doesn’t make apologies for what needs to be done to protect Americans, no matter who it offends. With the constant chatter of concern for “Islamophobia” after any attack, Islam-sympathizing city workers in Boston want to get their misguided message out about who’s really at fault, and it’s not the Somali cop who pulled the trigger. The investigation is still not completed into what happened Sunday night that led to bride-to-be Justine Damon being shot dead, but Muslims are already making their case against the American people with the help of city workers.

“City workers are putting up PSA posters around Boston Monday in a new initiative to show people how to safely step in and help stop incidents of Islamophobic harassment.”
“The cartoons depict a public transit scene where a disheartened-looking woman wearing a hijab sits while an irate person towers above her in a threatening manner. Another young woman looks on before deciding to intervene.”
“The step-by-step instructions, city officials said, encourage bystanders to quickly strike up conversations with Muslims being assailed by strangers, in hopes the actions will help disrupt the abuse, make victims feel safer and less alienated, and help disempower perpetrators.”
TRENDING ON FREEDOM DAILY
“Abuse?” Why aren’t there posters and billboards around American cities to express the real abuse and that’s the infiltration of Islam that Americans are being forced to accept? It’s all part of the plan of domination to use our sensitivities, political correctness, freedom, and laws created to cater to them to their advantage. Islam doesn’t strive to coexist with the western world, it hopes to take over our culture for not being like theirs and punish those who don’t submit. Where are the signs to teach citizens what to do if they see a woman being abused or mistreated by a Muslim? Boston should educate the masses in their city on that since it’s far more likely to happen than an unprovoked “Islamaphobia” attack.
“The posters also stress that both bystanders and victims should ignore the attacker, which city officials said in a statement is an approach called ‘non-complementary behavior’,” WBUR reported. “The logic is that harassers will stop or go away as others’ reactions deviate from their expectations and as they lose a captive audience.” It’s also interesting to note that these posters were originally created by a Paris-based artist back in 2015. This practice of acceptance hasn’t seemed to work too well in Paris in stopping numerous terror attacks since the creation of these signs.
What’s especially disturbing with these signs is the timing. Justin Damon was killed on Sunday evening and by Monday morning these posters were plastered all over the transit, hours ahead of the news breaking about the shooting around the country. Whether intentional or accidental, teaching people how to not be “Islamaphobic” isn’t helping keep people safe. It’s like telling people hand feed a tiger a cookie because it’s fur is soft and to ignore the fangs.
Share to show that “Islamaphobia” isn’t the cause of terror at attack by Muslims in America, it’s Islam. Americans shouldn’t be treated as the violent terrorists when we’re the victims.

"US H1B visa: Sushma Swaraj reveals Narendra Modi, Donald Trump discussed issue; here is what PM got American prez to do","Swaraj said Trump has admitted that the contribution of the Indian professionals was benefitting both the countries and “if they (US) harm their (professionals’) interests, then it will in turn affect them (US).” (Image Source: Reuters)
Prime Minister Narendra Modi discussed the “spirit” of H1B visa with President Donald Trump during their recent meeting and made him agree on crucial contribution of the Indian skilled professionals to the US economy, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said today.Answering questions in the Rajya Sabha over H1B visa restrictions imposed by the US, Swaraj said Trump has admitted that the contribution of the Indian professionals was benefitting both the countries and “if they (US) harm their (professionals’) interests, then it will in turn affect them (US).”
Talking about the meeting between Modi and Trump last month in Washington, she said, “without using the word H1B, there was extensive discussion” on the “spirit” behind such visas. “I take pride is saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi successfully convinced Trump to admit that Indian skilled professionals have a big contribution in strengthening the US economy,” she told the House where Modi was present. Swaraj said though the word H1B was not used, the joint Indo-US statement issued after talks between Modi and Trump starts with “applauding” the contribution of Indian IT professionals.

Congress leader Anand Sharma and CPI-M’s Tapan Kumar Sen wanted to know whether Modi specifically raised the issue of H1B issue with Trump. Sen said the spirit of the assurance on H1B was not matching with the ground realities as IT companies were hiring in the US and laying off people in India.Swaraj said she would make a detailed statement on the issue of H1B visas in the House later. Earlier, V Maitreyan (AIADMK) raised the issue of visas and asked the government to elaborate on the issue. He also welcomed Modi’s visit to the US as also to Israel.
To another question from D Raja of CPI about India resorting to increased defence purchases from the US, Swaraj said the present government was the first since 1952 to take steps towards self-reliance in defence production, including by opening up the sector to 100 percent FDI. “Earlier governments have come in, which you have also supported, did not take steps in this regard,” the minister told Raja.”Did any FDI come in? How will there be self-reliance? You need money, you need to set up factories. This is the first government that has allowed 100 percent FDI. The governments you supported never took steps towards self reliance,” she said.
Responding to Swaraj’s contention, Anand Sharma (Cong) said while earlier transfer of technology and offset was allowed, the BJP-led government had stopped such efforts. To a question on whether India was seeking advanced border fencing technology from Israel, Swaraj said Modi and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held detailed discussions on counter-terrorism and Israel does not have any problem in transfer of technology.
“Prime Minister Modi held detailed discussions on every issue with prime minister Netanyahu,” she said, adding that discussions during a dinner hosted by the Israeli PM lasted till 2:30 am. She underlined that Israel has well advanced technology in the fields of security and defence.",Financial Express,0
Getting Obliterated By A Jet Ski Doesn’t Seem Like A Pleasant Experience,"A viral video of a man getting destroyed by a jet ski swept across the internet Wednesday.
Three unidentified male individuals were messing around around on the beach, and appeared to be throwing sand at each other during their horseplay.
Little did they know that a jet ski was racing towards them. One of the men stepped backwards while not paying attention, and was quickly sent airborne by the water vehicle, which was traveling at an incredibly high speed.
You gotta ask yourself ..if you aren’t running your friend over these days are you actually even friends?
A post shared by Barstool Sports (@barstoolsports) on Jul 12, 2017 at 6:28am PDT
There are plenty of things that can ruin your day at the beach. It can storm, the beer runs out, the ice runs out while you still have beer left or the local ladies aren’t exactly dominating the beach scene. Those are all totally reasonable things that can ruin a quick jump down to the water.
However, getting run over by a jet ski while standing on dry land has never once been a concern of mine. That is all changed now. If jet skis can get to people on land then nobody is safe. This is not a precedent I’m comfortable with being set.

"Former Police Officer, FOP President Sentenced to Prison","PROVIDENCE – Christopher Hayes, 49, of Middletown, R.I., a former Newport, R.I., Police Department Sergeant and President of the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), Newport Lodge No. 8, was sentenced today to a total sentence of 12 months, 6 months imprisonment followed by 6 months of home confinement, for using FOP funds for personal use.
At sentencing, U.S. District Court Chief Judge William E. Smith also ordered Hayes to serve 3 years supervised release upon completion of his term of incarceration; pay $71,523 restitution to the FOP; and perform a total of 300 hours of community service during his term of supervised release. The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines range in this matter is 12-18 month. The government recommended the court impose a sentence of 12 months in prison.
Hayes pleaded guilty on May 1, 2017, to wire fraud. At the time of his guilty plea, Hayes admitted to the court that between August 2009 and December 2014, he used an FOP debit card to pay for his own personal expenses; wrote checks payable to himself from the FOP bank account; withdrew cash from the FOP bank account for personal use; and made online payments to his personal credit card from the FOP bank account.

Liberal Rag Faces MASSIVE BACKLASH After Blaming “Whiteness” For Warmbier’s Tragic Murder: “He Should’ve Respected The Laws” Of N. Korea,"Posted by Allan Stein
We've been told never to steal the hotel towels or make off with the Bible tucked away in the top bedside drawer because it's illegal.
But we do it anyway. If we get caught, we can still rest assured that our government won't be coming to kick down our door to arrest us and hold us for political ransom.
Maybe Otto Warmbier should have known better than to steal a propaganda poster during a visit to one of the worst places on earth -- communist North Korea. Maybe. He was just a kid in a foreign country -- and a bad one at that -- looking for a souvenir to take home.
Communists have never played nice and put Hitler to shame in terms of raw body count. So why should it have been any different in Kim Jung Un's tyrannical red paradise when Warmbier got caught making off with the poster in January 2016?
For trying to abscond with this little trinket, Warmbier spent 17 months in detention in a North Korean jail and was forced to confess to a ""hostile act"" while President Obama searched for a resolution to the diplomatic quagmire.
Under a new Republican administration Warmbier, 22, finally returned home to the United States -- in a coma -- and died shortly afterward.
His parents believe the North Korean government is responsible.
""Unfortunately, the awful torturous mistreatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans ensured that no other outcome was possible beyond the sad one we experienced today,” the Warmbiers said in a statement.
Affinity Magazine, a leftist anti-white rag that promotes open U.S. borders and immigrant scofflaws, blamed Warmbier for breaking North Korean laws and paying with his white life.
""Watch Whiteness Work,"" Affinity Magazine tweeted. ""He wasn't a ""kid"" or ""innocent"" you can't go to another country and try to steal from them. Respect their laws.""
""If you decide to go to North Korea then you have to respect their laws. Otherwise you better stay home.""
Yes, Affinity Mag, you shouldn't steal from another country and expect the red carpet treatment -- unless you're an illegal stealing from America. That's where the gravy really starts flowing, and your publication supports it.
As every country has laws on the books that every foreign guest ought to obey -- for obvious reasons -- there are just laws, and there are unjust laws.
The law by which Warmbier suffered and died qualifies as an unjust law and Warmbier, being an American, died for the ""crime"" of guilt by association with the U.S. government.
Affinity Magazine cynically tries to make ""whiteness"" an issue when the issue is the heavy neck-stomping boot of North Korea and the anti-white animus of Affinity Magazine.
Yes, Warmbier should have paid more attention to the laws of the Marxist hermit state North Korea, and no, he should not have been held for 17 months and died because of his ""offense.""
Affinity Magazine shows about as much compassion for Warmbier as the North Korean government did.
Mighty white of you, Affinity Magazine.
This disgusting insult hasn't gone unnoticed on Twitter. Check out some of the understandably furious responses:
What did you think about this article? Do you think Affinity Magazine is showing its anti-white hand by making whiteness and issue in the death of Otto Warmbier?

EU continues to support Al Qaeda and ISIS. Places sanctions on 16 Syrian scientists,"Alex Christoforou9 hours agoJuly 17, 2017 99
EU is ready to sanction 16 Syrians it blames for chemical attacks.
With it’s goal to overthrow Assad (and help the now feuding Qatar and Saudi Arabia build its energy pipeline through Damascus into Europe), falling apart in spectacular fashion, the regime in Brussels is left with nothing more than sanctions, in its petty effort to punish Assad for reclaiming the country he was elected to govern, and defeating the ISIS-Al Qaeda invaders.
The unelected EU regime in Brussel just announced that it has imposed sanctions on 16 Syrians “for their role in the development and use of chemical weapons against the civilian population”, the EU Council said in a statement.
“The Council added 16 persons to the list of those targeted by EU restrictive measures against the Syrian regime. The EU added these 16 persons for their role in the development and use of chemical weapons against the civilian population,”
Never mind that to date no evidence has been provided to show that Syria was behind the chemical attack which Seymour Hersh exposed as another fake news, false flag.
As the regime in Brussels imposes sanctions on Syrian scientists, with no evidence provided of wrongdoing, the bankrupt, morally deficient west gives Academy Awards to ISIS controlled White Helmets.
The targeted individuals include eight high-ranking military officials and eight scientists “involved in chemical weapons proliferation and delivery.” A total of 255 Syrians are now targeted under Brussels’ travel ban and an asset freeze in addition to 67 entities, according to the EU Council.
The EU institution’s corresponding legal act and the names of the 16 sanctioned Syrians are expected to be published in the Official Journal on Tuesday, July 18.
In April, the White House already sanctioned 271 employees of the center over their alleged involvement in the chemical weapons production in Syria. The restrictive measures included the freeze of the sanctioned individuals’ assets in the US banks as well as the prohibition for the US companies to conduct business operations with those individuals.
On April 4, the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces reported that dozens of people had been killed by the suspected chemical weapons attack in the country’s Idlib province. The opposition forces backed by the United States blamed the incident on the forces of Syria’s President Bashar Assad.
Damascus has denied any involvement in the incident, saying that the complete elimination of the Syrian government’s stockpile of chemical weapons was confirmed by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in January 2016.
On April 20, Assad in an interview with Sputnik said that there had been no chemical attack in Idlib and the footage proving it had been falsified. The Syrian leader called the incident a provocation to justify Washington’s attack on the Syrian government’s military airfield on April 6.",The Duran,1
Supreme Court decision raises new questions: Who is exempt from travel ban?,"Protesters wave signs and chant during a demonstration against President Donald Trump’s revised travel ban on May 15, 2017, outside a federal courthouse in Seattle. Ted S. WarrenAP

The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to only partially lift an injunction against President Donald Trump’s travel ban is likely to create a nightmare scenario for border officials and the lower courts, as federal officials struggle to decide who should and shouldn’t be allowed to enter the United States.
Both proponents and opponents of Trump’s temporary travel ban against six majority-Muslim countries expect more lawsuits this summer to define what it means to have a “bona fide relationship” with someone or some group in the United States.
The Supreme Court decided Monday to allow parts of Trump’s 90-day travel ban to go into effect and will hear oral arguments on the case in October. But the court will allow people from the six designated countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — to enter the U.S. if they can prove they have “bona fide relationship with any person or entity in the United States.”
In its 13-page decision, the court gave several examples of what it considers an appropriate bona fide relationship. They include a foreign national who wishes to visit a spouse or someone with a “close familial relationship;” a student who has been admitted by a university; a lecturer who has been invited to address an American audience, or a worker who has accepted a job from an American company.
But the court’s decision also left many open questions. What actually is a “close familial relationship?” Does it include a cousin or grandparent? What about a business person who is traveling to the United States on a job assignment or prospect?
One of the largest groups that immigration lawyers are concerned about are refugees. The court’s decision doesn’t explicitly address the conditions under which refugees from the six nations will continue to be allowed into the United States.
Presumably, the term “bona fide relationship” could apply to the tens of thousands of prospective refugees who have ties with a resettlement agency in the United States, immigration lawyers argue. But what about those prospective refugees who have not been assigned to a specific resettlement agency? At what stage in the process, which can take as long as two years, does such a relationship considered bona fide?
The compromise also will invite a flood of litigation until this case is finally resolved on the merits, as parties and courts struggle to determine what exactly constitutes a ‘bona fide relationship,’ who precisely has a ‘credible claim’ to that relationship, and whether the claimed relationship was formed ‘simply to avoid’ the executive order,”
Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration professor at Cornell Law School, argues that a refugee who has already been identified by a U.S. refugee resettlement agency and is just waiting to board a plane will likely be allowed to enter. But a person who is just starting the refugee application process and doesn’t have any ties to the United States probably won’t.
Organizations that challenged the ban argued that most people from the affected countries attempting to enter the United States already have the necessary long-standing relationship. But the International Refugee Assistance Projects and ACLU lawyers said they’re ready if the administration tries interpret the court’s decision more aggressively and ban more people from entering.
“It's going to be very important for us over this intervening period to make sure the government abides by the terms of the order and does not try to use it as a back door into implementing the full-scale Muslim ban that it's been seeking to implement,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU immigrants’ rights project.
The justices also said that a nonprofit group devoted to immigration issues could not simply add a foreign national from one of the designated countries to its client list just so that person could travel to the United States.
David Bier, a former senior policy adviser for Rep. Raúl Labrador, R-Idaho, said the Trump administration is likely to take a more skeptical view of some of these relationships immigration advocates claim as bona fide.
“With respect to resettlement organizations, for example, it’s only by interpreting, extrapolating the words of the Supreme Court that you get to the idea that these organizations would constitute a legitimate relationship,” said Bier, now an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute.
The high court’s decision to consider the ban in October, and lift lower courts’ orders blocking the measure, was Trump’s first major victory on the issue — after multiple courts blocked the travel ban against travelers from the six countries.
In a dissenting opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas argued that that injunction against Trump’s travel ban should be completely lifted. He predicts the lawsuits and called the court’s remedy “unworkable.” He said it would burden executive officials with the task of deciding whether individuals from the six affected nations have a sufficient connection to a person in the U.S. to be allowed to enter the country.
“The compromise also will invite a flood of litigation until this case is finally resolved on the merits, as parties and courts struggle to determine what exactly constitutes a ‘bona fide relationship,’ who precisely has a ‘credible claim’ to that relationship, and whether the claimed relationship was formed ‘simply to avoid’ the executive order,” Justice Thomas wrote in a dissent, which was joined Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch.
Confusion about Trump’s initial order created chaos at U.S. airports as immigration and customs agents initially blocked the entry of all citizens from the involved countries, including those who had lived in the United States for years.
White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer referred all questions about what it means to have a bona fide relationship to the Justice Department.
DHS officials said Monday they’re reviewing the order with the departments of Justice and State.
“The implementation of the Executive Order will be done professionally, with clear and sufficient public notice, particularly to potentially affected travelers, and in coordination with partners in the travel industry,” DHS said in a statement.
Amnesty International filed a Freedom of Information Act request Monday seeking documents to show how federal agencies plan to implement the ban.
“The public needs to know exactly what agents in airports nationwide are being told to do, and we need to know now,” said Margaret Huang, Amnesty International USA’s executive director.
Yale-Loehr called the Supreme Court’s order a “partial win” for the Trump administration, but agreed it will be confusing to implement without greater clarity of what constitutes a bona fide relationship.
“How individuals will prove such a relationship, and whether the burden of proof will be on the government or the individuals seeking entry, remains to be seen,” Yale-Loehr said. “I predict chaos at the border and new lawsuits as foreign nationals and refugees argue that they are entitled to enter the United States.”

BREAKING: Rosie O’Donnell Encourages Followers To KILL Trump In Disturbing Way…,"July 17, 2017 News
Inciting violence against President Donald Trump is becoming mainstream liberal politics.
First, it was liberal agitators that rioted against the elections. Then, a New York City play depicted an assassination of President Trump. Finally, it was d-list comedian Kathy Griffin holding a severed head of the U.S. commander in chief.
After all of this, and much more, Rosie O’Donnell has officially jumped on the “kill Trump” bandwagon.
In a twitter post, she promoted a new game in which you murder the president by pushing him off a cliff into anything from a volcano to the jaws of a T-Rex.
The game, “Push Trump Off A Cliff Again,” instructs users to “Take out your frustrations with [the] President by pushing him off a virtual cliff, or into a virtual volcano.” A virtual Trump shouts out phrases including “Bye!” and “I’m really rich!” as he tumbles to his death.
And the media still wonders why a Bernie Sanders supporter decided to shoot up a baseball practice full of GOP congressmen?

Our story last week about the SLC quadrupling someone’s interest rate sparked a new wave of complaints
• Share your stories of working while studying at university
Saturday 29 July 2017 02.00 EDTLast modified on Saturday 29 July 2017 03.14 EDT
When Gary Ashworth moved to Botswana in 2013 to try to start a design business, he immediately told the Student Loans Company that he would be out of the UK. Despite updating the company with his earnings, as requested, last year he discovered that £930 was being demanded by a firm of debt collectors.
The reason for this harsh penalty? He apparently failed to put his date of birth on one of the numerous forms sent by the loan company. Ashworth is just the latest graduate to complain to Guardian Money about what they allege is heavy-handed and unfair treatment at the hands of the SLC, an organisation that appears to be fast turning into one of the UK’s least-liked brands.
The designer, who now lives in Gaborone, was one of the hundreds of graduates to respond to last Saturday’s Money report into the case of Jenny Richards, claiming they had similarly been on the wrong end of poor treatment. In her case, the SLC wrongly quadrupled the interest on her £42,000 loan from 0.9% to 3.9% for a perceived error she had never made. She had also gone abroad, in this instance only for a few months, but then faced a year-long battle to get the SLC to rectify the mistake and provide proof it had done so. Only Money’s intervention finally delivered evidence that her loan wasn’t growing at a higher rate, she says.
Fed-up graduates have since told us of being on the receiving end of similar treatment by the SLC, which many claim is not up to the task of administering the huge sums that student loans have become. They also complain of punitive charges and the bureaucratic nightmare of dealing with the lender. Many are furious it has been allowed to change significantly the terms of borrowing and raise interest rates after loans are taken out.
Ashworth’s case was one of the more extreme. The 37-year-old studied design at what is now Bolton University. “Before I left for Botswana I informed SLC, which asked me to complete an overseas assessment form, which I did, and my loan was frozen for 12 months. I had started a graphic design business, but the market here is saturated meaning it was slow to get going and my income remained below the repayments threshold.
“For the first couple of years SLC was sympathetic. However, last year it all changed and I found myself being contacted by representatives from a company called Transcom, a debt collection agency. My outstanding balance suddenly included a £930 arrears,” he says. Trying to get to the bottom of what had happened entailed countless emails and phone calls over a period of months. Eventually, it emerged that he’d been penalised because he had failed to include his date of birth on a form. “The whole experience was very unpleasant and I felt I wasn’t receiving any support or clarity from SLC. It essentially washed its hands of me. There’s no quick way to contact it when overseas. You can email but it can take 28 days to reply – assuming it bothers to do so,” he says. Ashworth has since paid off the loan apart from the £930, but says he can’t get a straight answer out of the SLC or Transcom as to his exact position.
And he is by no means alone. Those heading abroad appear to have had a particularly difficult time. Another wrote: “The SLC is horrendous to deal with. I’m living abroad studying for a doctorate and, despite sending all requested information, it continues to ask me for it. It’s a bureaucratic nightmare: on the phone they confirm receipt, then I get letters and emails. I repeated this a few times, then was told everything was in order. Next letter I got was to say my loan had been passed to a debt recovery agency.”
SLC is committed to protecting the public purse and has a duty to collect all taxpayer monies owed
A repeated complaint is about the intrusive questioning and demands. Another graduate, who this time gave up his job to switch careers, described the problem of convincing the SLC he wasn’t working because he was not claiming jobseeker’s allowance. It wanted letters from his wife, bank statements and more. The matter took months to resolve, which he contrasts with dealing with HMRC which accepted his changed status with one letter and without fuss. He had considered doing a teaching course but says he decided against it, partly because it would have forced him back into the hands of the SLC.
A spokesman for the SLC told Money that Ashworth has not been hit with £930 penalty charges. Instead, this sum was demanded because he failed to fill in the overseas form for the year starting in February 2015, and it was assumed he was earning above the payments threshold. It has offered to send him a full statement setting out what he has repaid.
“SLC is committed to protecting the public purse and has a duty to collect all taxpayer monies owed. We endeavour to contact all customers who move overseas for a period of three months or more to ensure that those who should be making repayments are doing so, and to distinguish those customers who are not eligible to repay from those that are deliberately trying to avoid repaying.”
He declined to respond to wider questions about the way the SLC is managed.
Difficult dealings – your experiences
“This reminds me of my own student loan nightmare. I had started paying them back (and had made every payment) when, out of the blue, I got a letter saying one of my loans had gone into arrears and that I had to bring payments up to date, pay an arrears fee or face legal action.
No other provider of a loan would be able to operate in the same way
It took ages to sort out – loads of phone calls and time spent going through bank statements before I thought to check the account number of the loan I’d missed payments on. Turns out they had mixed up account numbers and I’d been paying back someone else’s loan while they’d been failing to pay back mine. SLC agreed to cancel the fee but still tried to charge £15 admin for the letter they’d erroneously sent. SLC has always been a terrible organisation, it’s just much worse now the sums involved are around 10 times the amount I borrowed. It’s scandalous.” Norsked
“This ‘company’ is a nightmare. I’ve suffered from all sorts of administrative nightmares, only minor but absolutely opaque. No other provider of a loan would be able to operate in the same way.” Cloud9
“In my experience they have awful record-keeping practices. I phoned recently to find out how much I had paid and what my total loan was (so I could make an early repayment). The person on the end of the phone had to go away for 15 minutes and add up my contributions. When I rang again a day or two later I got a different answer to my questions. Scary when we’re talking 10s of thousands of pounds for most people.” D1255358
“My daughter worked abroad for a year and sent them all the documentation. She set up a direct debit to pay her student loan each month while she was away. At the end of the year she obtained a three-month job in the US. The SLC immediately started taking £250 a month out of her account as they had access to this through her direct debit (originally for a much smaller amount). This put her in financial difficulties. It was sorted out on her return to the UK, but they treat people extremely harshly.” ID5279121
“The government froze the threshold for repayment and hiked the interest rate retroactively, and, despite there being talk of a legal challenge, none has materialised. It appears that in this country, contract law means nothing if your contract is with a government-owned company. The contract I signed is no longer the set of terms I am held to, so the core principles being legally binding on both parties appears to simply not apply any more.” Alexandra Greenway
“The problem is the SLC isn’t regulated like any other company providing personal loans. They are able to fundamentally change the rules: payback thresholds, interest rates, going abroad – whatever they fancy. I was about to start some additional voluntary contributions but my work gave me a warning that SLC will not repay any accidental overpayments! It needs to be regulated in line with other financial services.” Mrvincent",The Guardian – Politics,0

But a total of nine Republican Senators—Susan Collins (ME), Bob Corker (TN), Lindsey Graham (SC), Tom Cotton (AR), Dean Heller (NV), Jerry Moran (KS), Mike Lee (UT), Lisa Murkowski (AK) and Rand Paul (KY)—voted against the repeal-and-replace proposal.
While it’s not much of a surprise, not one Democrat voted for it.
The proposal was an amendment to bring health care to a vote, but it fell far short of the 60 votes needed to pass.
The Senate will likely vote on another amendment today. Should it pass, it would repeal most of Obamacare.
The Senate also voted on amendments proposed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH), but neither passed.
Cruz says he thinks his amendment will be part of the final health care bill. This amendment would allow insurance companies to sell plans that do not meet Obamacare requirements.
The Senate leadership has been trying to force Trump’s health care bill through Congress after weeks of working on the legislation in secret. A huge chunk of senators still have not had the chance to examine Trumpcare.
The Congressional Budget Office, AARP and many high-profile Americans have publicly spoken out against the GOP health care bill.
Under Trumpcare, more than 20 million Americans stand to lose their health care coverage and Medicare will be cut by hundreds of billions of dollars. The bill will also scrap the entire Medicare expansion under Obamacare.
And we’ll all die a horrible death, suffering from preventable diseases that could have been treated but for want of health care.
POLL: Is Trumpcare doomed?
Will the Senate manage to make this horrible legislation pass?
Under Trump’s health care plan, many Americans will pay much more for the privilege of having health insurance. And make no mistake—under Trump, it is a privilege and not a right. Older Americans, people with pre-existing conditions and low-income Americans will find themselves paying more for health insurance. Millions of others will find the cost prohibitive.
Currently, there are 52 Republican Senators, 46 Democrats and two Independents serving the nation. The GOP will need 60 votes to pass Trumpcare and any related legislation.
Earlier today, Donald Trump took to Twitter to publicly rebuke Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska for voting against the repeal-and-replace bill, saying that she “really let the Republicans, and our country, down yesterday. Too bad!”
Murkowski won her seat in an historic write-in vote in 2010 after losing the primary to a Tea Party contender. So Murkowski isn’t feeling a lot of love from or for the GOP anyway, and Donald Trump certainly isn’t helping.
As she exited Congress yesterday, Murkowski was greeted by supporters chanting “Stay strong, Lisa.”
Stay strong, Lisa. Stay strong, Democrats. And stay strong, all nine Republican Senators who refused to vote with their party to repeal and replace Obamacare. They’re in the fight of their lives right now, and it’s up to the rest of the country to support them in it.
Share this story, and show your support for all the senators—both Democrat and Republican—who refuse to replace our existing health care system with one that’s worse for all of us.",Learn Progress,1
"In Remembrance: Sean Spicer’s Career As Press Secretary, Cut Tragically Short At Just Six Months Old (VIDEO)","GooglePinterestDiggLinkedin Reddit Stumbleupon PrintDeliciousPocketTumblr
All of the news outlets lit up Friday morning with the news of Sean “Shady Spice” Spicer’s resignation as Donald Trump’s Press Secretary.
Subscribe to our Youtube Channel
One by one, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and even CNN all reported the premature death of Spicer’s career after he apparently just had enough. The erstwhile Easter Bunny, no stranger to public humiliation, apparently found a reason to end it all when his now-former boss announced the appointment of Wall Street financier Anthony Scaramucci as his communications director.
Spicer outlasted former Trump comms chief Mike Dubke by nearly three months and was ostensibly seeking to replace him after Dubke’s abrupt resignation in May. The selection of Scaramucci, who though older than Spicer is much more handsome, angered some in Trump’s staff, including Spicer himself. No longer able to stomach being overlooked for more attractive and far less shrill competitors, Spicer threw in the towel on what will surely be remembered as a sad day for the White House Press Corps and the American public.
Perhaps most devastated of all will be the cast of Saturday Night Live, and Melissa McCarthy specifically, who helped make Sean Spicer tolerable in small doses for the rest of humanity.
Let’s take the opportunity to look back at this May 2017 Time Magazine retrospective of some of Shady’s greatest hits as we honor his legacy and sacrifice:
Sean, we hardly knew ye. But with your passing, we hold out hope that the next guy, whoever it may be, can shine as brightly as you did (for roughly as long).

TSA to require separate X-ray screening of electronics larger than a cellphone,"| Jul 26, 2017, 1:43 PMShare on TwitterShare on FacebookEmail this articleShare on LinkedIn
TSA's new security measure follows an aviation security plan announced by Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly last month, which applied to international flights coming into the United States. (AP Photo/David Goldman)
The Transportation Security Administration announced Wednesday that passengers will now be required to place any electronics larger than a cellphone separately through X-ray machines at all U.S. airports.
""Whether you're flying to, from, or within the United States, TSA is committed to raising the baseline for aviation security by strengthening the overall security of our commercial aviation network to keep flying as a safe option for everyone,"" TSA Acting Administrator Huban Gowadia said in a statement.
Under TSA's prior policy, only laptops needed to be removed from carry-on luggage and placed in separate bins for X-ray screening.
But the new policy requires travelers in standard security lanes to remove any electronics larger than a cellphone — such as tablets, e-readers, and hand-held game consoles — from their luggage and placed in a separate bin for screening.
TSA's new security measure follows an aviation security plan announced by Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly last month, which applied to international flights coming into the United States. Homeland Security's plan included enhanced screening of electronics, more thorough passenger vetting, and additional measures to mitigate the threat of insider attacks, and was designed to thwart new ways for terrorists to sneak bombs onto planes.
TSA tested its new screening measure for small electronics at 10 airports, and it'll now be expanded to all airports in the U.S. in the coming weeks and months.
""It is critical for TSA to constantly enhance and adjust security screening procedures to stay ahead of evolving threats and keep passengers safe,"" Gowadia said.
The new security measure does not apply to travelers enrolled in TSA's PreCheck program.

Mexico's elite desperately want their own Emmanuel Macron,"Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto shakes hands with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace in Paris on July 6. (Etienne Laurent/European Pressphoto Agency)
MEXICO CITY — When Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto met his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, in Paris last week to talk climate, trade and migration, the reaction back home was gushing.
""There’s chemistry between Peña Nieto and Macron,"" read a headline in the Crónica newspaper, which followed several weeks during which Mexico’s chattering classes fawned over the French leader.
""Dear Emmanuel Macron,"" wrote author Guadalupe Loaeza in a recent (and oft-mocked) Reforma newspaper column, ""I could not let another day pass without telling you that my country, Mexico, is eagerly trying to find a ‘Macron’ for the 2018 presidential elections.""
Indeed, no fewer than five probable presidential candidates have been named the ""Mexican Macron,"" the man who will supposedly unite the country, fend off populism and impose pragmatic, centrist rule. Amid widespread anger at Peña Nieto — whose approval rating wallows in the teens — and the endemically corrupt political class in general, Mexico’s political and social elite see such a mythic figure as the way to stave off anti-establishment left-wing candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador.
""The excitement about a 'Macron Mexicano’ is not about change. It’s about the elites trying to find a reasonable profile to maintain things as they are,"" said José Merino, a political science professor and the director of data analysis firm Data4 in Mexico City. This is ""the search for a Mexican apolitical technocrat that due to his biography will solve everything, even under the same circumstances.""
The search is so fevered that it embraces candidates who seemingly have little in common. Some are independents. Some are partisans. Some are controversial and close to the current administration — like Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray, who invited President Trump to the presidential palace for an ill-fated appearance. Most are hardly fresh faces at all.
But the Macron template appears too attractive to pass up, even for the establishment titan of Mexican politics, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI. Several of the would-be Macrons come from the PRI, which has previously tried running young, supposedly reform-minded politicians — only to end up with a batch of governors confronting graft charges.
[A Mexican populist rises to face Trump’s America]
""The PRI has basically settled on that strategy of presentation,"" said Federico Estévez, a political science professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. ""It’s going to be somebody who stakes out a very normal position for a Mexican politician with respect to the world, which is open, liberal international, free trade, all of that, with a few rhetorical tricks to makes sure you know this person is actually Mexican.""
""The rest of it is [raising the] fears of the worst,"" said Estévez — meaning attacks on López Obrador. ""It’s all negative.""
The elites’ villain, López Obrador, is a former mayor of Mexico City and perennial presidential hopeful. His opponents have branded him ""populist"" and ""messianic,"" often making dark comparisons to Venezuela’s late socialist leader, Hugo Chávez. Yet some observers see an irony at play, with his opponents seeking their own messiah rather than strengthening institutions or the rule of law.
""It’s ironic that the defenders of the idea [of a Mexican Macron] place so much faith in a single man — a nonexistent man — when they criticize that same thing about [López Obrador] and his followers,"" Merino said.
Most observers, in fact, don’t see any Macrons in Mexican politics.
""It’s a political fantasy. There is nobody even close to that sort of figure on the Mexican political landscape, with that sort of ascending career, that intellectual firepower, that media talent,"" said Carlos Bravo Regidor, a professor at the Center for Research and Teaching of Economics.

The Mexican Macron idea is thought to have started with former Mexican foreign minister Jorge Castañeda, a longtime proponent of independent candidacies.
In a May interview with the Televisa network, Castañeda touted Sen. Armando Ríos Piter — who has announced plans to run for president as an independent and has drawn Castañeda’s endorsement — as a Macron-like politician. He ""has a lot of similarities with Macron: age, freshness [and] an ability to pull in people from the left, center and even the center-right,"" Castañeda said. Like in France, ""there are conditions for an independent, anti-party candidacy in Mexico.""
Ríos Piter, a 44-year-old from the southern state of Guerrero who recently abandoned the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, played down the comparisons to Macron — sort of. He told news outlet Nación321 that the widespread dissatisfaction in Mexico was ""very similar to what happened in France recently,"" making it possible for an independent to win the presidency.
When asked if he was the Mexican Macron, though, he instead fired back at his potential rivals. ""Who would be Marine Le Pen in Mexico?"" he responded. ""I think all the political parties are Marine Le Pen.""",Washington Post – World,0
VOTER FRAUD IS REAL: A College Student Caught Registering DEAD PEOPLE TO VOTE DEMOCRAT Is Now Going To Jail!,"Victor Medina3 hours ago
Democrats insist that voter fraud is a Republican myth. A college student in Virginia just proved otherwise.
For months, President Trump has insisted that voter fraud played a role in his losing the popular vote. Now he has proof.
The college student, Andrew Spieles, was working for a political group with strong ties to the Democratic party.
A student from James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia, will spend at least 100 days in prison after admitting to registering deceased voters for Democrats during the 2016 presidential election.
Andrew J. Spieles, 21, pleaded guilty Monday in the U.S. District Court of the Western District of Virginia to submitting the names of dead voters to the registrar’s office in Harrisonburg, WTVR-TV reported.
The student was working for Harrisonburg Votes when he committed the crime, according to U.S. Attorney Rick A. Mountcastle. Harrisonburg Votes, whose website has since been deleted, has ties to the Democratic Party.
The political organization was founded by former Harrisonburg Mayor Joe Fitzgerald, a Democratic activist who was in office from 2002 to 2004, according to The Washington Post. Fitzgerald fired Spieles and disavowed his actions once the allegations were made public in August.
“In July 2016, Spieles’ job was to register as many voters as possible and report to Democratic campaign headquarters in Harrisonburg,” a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office told WTVR. “In August 2016, Spieles was directed to combine his registration numbers with those of another individual because their respective territories overlapped.

“After filling out a registration form for a voter,” the spokesperson continued, “Spieles entered the information into a computer system used by the Virginia Democratic Party to track information such as name, age, address, and political affiliation. Every Thursday an employee [or] volunteer hand-delivered the paper copies of the registration forms to the registrar’s office in Harrisonburg.”
But Spieles was caught when one vigilant employee at the registrar’s office recognized one of the names he submitted — it belonged to the deceased father of a Rockingham County judge. The staffer called the police.
That discovery led the registrar’s office to unearth “multiple instances of similarly falsified forms when it reviewed additional registrations,” the U.S. attorney’s office spokesperson explained.
“Some were in the names of deceased individuals while others bore incorrect middle names, birth dates, and social security numbers,” the spokesperson continued. “The registrar’s office learned that the individuals named in these forms had not, in fact, submitted the new voter registrations.”
According to the news report, Spieles later admitted to committing the crime. He explained that he obtained the names, ages, and addresses of individuals from “walk sheets” given to him by the Virginia Democratic Party. From there, he would fabricate birth dates and social security numbers for the falsified voters before registering them.
In total, the JMU student said he created 18 fraudulent voter forms himself and said no one else participated in the crime.

"After 14 Year Freeze, China Is Now Accepting 1 Huge Import From The U.S. All Thanks To Our President","Under President Trump, new opportunities are being created all the time.
This has been true with our international relations. Thanks to Trump, the nation of China seems more cooperative and willing to work with the U.S. on important issues.
We’ve also learned that America has negotiated a new trade deal with the nation, one that can be very profitable for U.S. companies.
After a 14 year freeze, the nation of China is finally accepting a Texas-style import: American beef.
According to Newsmax, a trade agreement between the two countries was signed in May, and now the Chinese government has allowed the first of those shipments to pass through its borders.
China is no small country, and the meat market is no small opportunity.
“Chinese importers are racing to bring in American beef to meet increasing demand for premium meat in the $2.6 billion beef import market,” stated Newsmax…
That multi billion-dollar market could soon be dominated by U.S. ranchers, who are competing with Australian beef providers. American beef is expected to be less expensive and more competitive, due to low grain prices in the heartland.
When Trump said he would put Americans first, that did not mean we’d start to neglected the rest of the world. Nor did that mean he wouldn’t work to strike good deals for the United States with other countries.
This is one example of America making deals that benefit American companies. Imagine the amount of meat U.S. ranchers can potentially sell to a nation of over 1 billion people. That’s a lot of burgers!
In the coming years, we could see incredible amounts of revenue pour into the U.S. thanks to this deal. We are one of the top producers of beef in the world. Even with Australia as a competitor, China will be buying quite a bit of beef from us.
But rest assured, there will be plenty of beef still for the voracious appetites in the U.S. Because if you think I’m going without my steak, you’re crazy.

U.S. bombers fly over S. Korea after N. Korea's ICBM test,"APJuly 30, 2017, 1:01 AM
 
U.S. B-1 bombers conduct bilateral missions over South Korea on July 30. 2017.
SEOUL, South Korea -- The United States flew two supersonic bombers over the Korean Peninsula on Sunday in a show of force against North Korea following the country's latest intercontinental ballistic missile test.
The B-1 bombers were escorted by South Korean fighter jets as they performed a low-pass over an air base near the South Korean capital of Seoul before returning to the Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, the U.S. Pacific Air Forces said in a statement.
It said the mission was a response to consecutive ICBM tests by North Korea this month. Analysts say flight data from North Korea's second ICBM test conducted Friday night showed that a broader part of the mainland United States, including Los Angeles and Chicago, is now in range of Pyongyang's weapons.
""North Korea remains the most urgent threat to regional stability,"" Gen. Terrence J. O'Shaughnessy, Pacific Air Forces commander, said. ""Diplomacy remains the lead. However, we have a responsibility to our allies and our nation to showcase our unwavering commitment while planning for the worst-case scenario.""
North Korea launches second intercontinental ballistic missile
North Korea's latest missile test is raising new concerns that they could hit deep into the mainland U.S. On Friday, the North launched its secon...
He added: ""If called upon, we are ready to respond with rapid, lethal, and overwhelming force at a time and place of our choosing.""
The United States often sends powerful warplanes in times of heightened animosities with North Korea. B-1 bombers have been sent to South Korea for flyovers several times this year in response to North Korea's banned missile tests, and also following the death of a U.S. college student last month after he was released by North Korean in a coma.
The Hwasong-14 ICBM, which the North first tested on July 4, is the highlight of several new weapons systems Pyongyang launched this year. They include an intermediate range missile the North says is capable of hitting Alaska and Hawaii and a solid-fuel midrange missile, which analysts say can be fired faster and more secretly than liquid-fuel missiles.

Russia Is Begging For A War After What They Just Did To US Plane With Fighter Jet,"Posted by Allan Stein
In all likelihood the U.S. and Russia will be at war by year's end.
Syria is the flashpoint.
""Provocative"" interactions have occurred with alarming frequency in recent weeks with the latest incident involving a Russian Su-27 jet armed with air-to-air missiles coming within five feet of a U.S. Air Force RC135 spy plane flying reconnaissance over the Baltic region, on Russia's doorstep Monday.
Tensions between the U.S. and Russia have increased dramatically with the shooting down of a Syrian government jet bomber by a U.S. fighter jet flying within Syrian airspace Sunday. Washington officials claim the Syrian aircraft was bombing U.S. backed ""moderate"" rebels in Syria. The Syrian government said ISIS was the target.
In response, Syria's ally Russia announced any hostile military aircraft west of the Euphrates will be targeted.
Now we're told that a US F-15 fighter jet has shot down an Iranian drone over Syrian airspace.
This is a huge escalation of the conflict in Syria.
Remember, the U.S. is not officially at war with the sovereign government of Syria. Neither has there been formal congressional approval of military action inside of or against Syria.
Russian officials called the downing of the Syrian aircraft a ""stab in the back"" by Washington as U.S. officials talk the talk about fighting ISIS, but the real goal is regime change and the partition of Syria.
Qui bono? Who benefits?
""We are aware of the Russian statements,"" Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said Monday, quoted by the Washington Examiner, as reported in ZeroHedge. ""We do not seek conflict with any party in Syria other than ISIS, but we will not hesitate to defend ourselves or our partners if threatened,"" Davis said.
ZeroHedge added that Davis is ""seemingly unaware that shooting down a sovereign nation's plane above its own territory is exactly what 'seeking a conflict"" looks like.' ""
President Trump promised better relations with Russia in the war against Islamic terrorism. Instead, we are inching closer to thermonuclear war with Russia and only a few U.S. politicians -- Kentucky Republican Rand Paul and Democrat Tulsi Gabbard, to name two -- are willing to challenge neocon madmen like John McCain.
Got potassium iodine pills?
What do you think? Do you think the latest close encounter with a Russian military aircraft in Syria marks a turning point in U.S. relations with Russia?

New survey compares tipping habits of Republicans vs. Democrats,"Sara Gonzales 3 hours
According to a new survey, Republicans are better tippers than Democrats. Also, americans making $75,000 or more per year were the highest tippers, according to the survey. (STR/AFP/Getty Images)
Many Democratic lawmakers have accused Republicans of not paying their fair share, but according to a new survey released Sunday, in the battle of tipping habits, Republicans give more than their counterparts.
The poll, conducted by Creditcards.com through Princeton Survey Research Associates, found that 59 percent of Republicans gave a restaurant tip above 15 percent, compared to only 46 percent of Democrats who gave over 15 percent. Fifty-seven percent of independents also reported tipping above 15 percent.
Other than Republicans, groups who topped the poll included males, Northeasterners, baby boomers, and those who paid with credit cards. On the other hand, groups who were among the worst tippers included women, who tipped at an average of 16 percent, Southerners, and Democrats, who both came in around 15 percent.
Americans making $75,000 or more per year were the highest tippers, according to the survey. Overall, four out of five Americans said they always give a restaurant tip, with the usual tip averaging out to be 18 percent.
Cornell University professor Michael Lynn, who studies gratuity practices, told Creditcards.com that although there are many different factors affecting tipping practices, it usually comes down to wealth: The wealthier a patron is, the more he is willing to tip.
In addition to tipping the most at restaurants, the poll also showed that Republicans and independents are more likely than Democrats to tip hair stylists and coffee shop baristas.

Is the Taliban Still a Threat to US Security?,"16 years later, the original rationale for the war on Afghanistan still holds true.
The Taliban continues to pose an imminent threat not only to the survival of the democratic system in Afghanistan, but also to regional and international security. Following the premature withdrawal of international combat forces from Afghanistan, the terrorist group has been able to establish a strong presence in rural Afghanistan. It has launched numerous suicide, car bomb, roadside IED, and ambush attacks, killing thousands of civilians, and inflicting heavy human and material casualties on the Afghan National Security Forces. Using terror and intimidation, the Taliban has been able to push the government out of many districts around the country and fill the security gap left behind by the international coalition forces in vast swaths of the country.
The Taliban aims to secure a space in which it can operate freely, planning and launching further assaults on districts and provinces neighboring the territory already under its control. By gaining ground and influence in a number of localities, it could once again host other terrorist organizations such as al-Qaeda on Afghan soil. Thus, while the Taliban remains an existential threat to the Afghan government, it also serves as a potential danger to regional and international security.
The war in Afghanistan was launched in 2001 as retaliation for the 9/11 attacks in American. Will the Taliban of today be willing to once again sponsor a terrorist group potentially capable of launching an attack on U.S. soil? The likelihood is high. The Taliban’s perception of and attitude toward the West is similar to that of other terrorist groups operating in the Middle East. The militant group shares an ideology with al-Qaeda and Islamic State, founded on the assumption that Christians and Jews are the “enemies of Islam” and Muslims must resort to whatever means necessary to inflict harm upon them. The Taliban has never failed to conceal its unfavorable views and feelings toward Western nations. It has repeatedly declared the United States and its allies to be “invading crusaders” whose aim is to enslave Afghans and assert their dominance in the region.

In its videos and articles, primarily designed to galvanize support and recruit new members, the Taliban argues that, according to Quranic teachings, it is the duty of Muslims to wage jihad against the American eshghal-gar, or occupiers. In videos produced and distributed by Taliban’s Al Emarah Jihadist Studio, it is repeatedly argued that Afghans serving or collaborating with the U.S. and its “puppet regime” are mulhedin (apostates) and deserve to be killed. Assessing hundreds of Taliban articles, commentaries, narratives, chants, audio, and video documentaries, it is easy to conclude that harming U.S. citizens remains a priority in the Taliban agenda. Clearly, jihadists remain inspired by a shared anti-U.S. ideology and aspirations to inflict harm to any predominantly Christian or Jewish populated nation.
Therefore, the Afghan Taliban’s ability to open and secure a space in which it could safely operate and offer sanctuary to other terrorist groups is a matter of major concern. Let us remember that prior to September 11 terrorist attacks, although the United States had not taken any hostile measures toward the Taliban regime, it gave refuge to Osama Bin Laden. The self-proclaimed Amir-ul Momenin, Leader of the Faithful, Mullah Omar provided Bin Laden a sanctuary from which he plotted and launched attacks on the United States.
Ever since, pro-Taliban online publications such as nunn.asia.com and the Taliban’s webpage, Alemarah1.org have repeatedly argued in countless articles and commentaries that “Christians have waged a crusade against Islam.” The leaders of al-Qaeda, ISIS, al-Shabab, and other jihadist groups in Pakistan have all been insisting on the same line of reasoning to justify their “jihad” against the “infidels.” Today, it is well within the realm of possibility that the Taliban could attain the capability to host foreign terrorist groups similar to al-Qaeda. This will also help the Taliban neutralize rivalries and gain monetary, human, and material support from its jihadist counterparts. It could achieve this utilizing its territorial gains, political leverage, and established roots among the local population.
The Taliban’s success in launching terrorist attacks has seriously jeopardized the legitimacy of the Afghan state. Most recently, it launched an offensive on the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), killing more than 100 soldiers in Balkh province. Such deadly offensives have frequently led to the killing and wounding of thousands of civilians. Since the withdrawal of international combat forces from Afghanistan, the Taliban has overrun dozens of security posts in districts and cities around the country. According to the Long War Journal, in 2016, it captured and controlled 42 and contested 55 of the 407 districts throughout the country. The Taliban even captured the capital of Kunduz province in October of 2015, and once again raided the city on the same month in 2016.
Due to diminishing Western support, training, and effective leadership from the center, in general, Afghan security forces have not been able to counter Taliban offensives in various districts. This has led to improved morale among the group’s leaders, and subsequently an increase in the number of suicide, ambush, and IED attacks in and around major cities such Kabul. Furthermore, widespread insecurity weakens morale among the Afghan security forces as well as public confidence in the ability of the government to protect them. This terrorist organization has killed thousands of Afghan security forces, civilians, as well as Western civilian and military staff. In 2016 alone 3,498 civilians were killed and 7,920 were injured due to the ongoing conflict between the Taliban and the government security forces. The Taliban poses a grave threat to the very existence of the Afghan government and the democratic system that has cost thousands of American lives and billions of dollars to establish.
Without further international support, the Taliban is likely to secure space in which it could expand its operation beyond Afghanistan, as it did in the past. This will indeed prove devastating to the United States’ and its allies’ anti-terror efforts in preventing attacks on the U.S. and other pro-Western states. Assessing Taliban’s 2016 terrorist operations throughout Afghanistan, it is reasonable to presume that it will launch even more deadly and frequent attacks on major districts and cities, including Kabul, in 2017. Its success in Afghanistan will prove detrimental to the Afghan government’s rule and legitimacy in vast regions of the country.
To ignore the Taliban as a serious threat to regional and international security is a grave mistake. The United States and its allies must take serious measures to strengthen Afghan National Security Forces and enable them to effectively fight against this dangerous terrorist organization.

Watch! Top Republican Caught On Cam: GOP Will ‘Never’ Repeal Obamacare,"POLITICS US CONSERVATIVE NEWS VIDEOS
 
July 25, 2017Alex D.4 Views 0 Comments# Donald Trump, Obamacare, Republicans
Obama sure is out of office but he is definitely not gone and trying to cause as much disruption for President Trump as possible. His goal – remove President Trump.
One of his legacy called Obamacare is still active something that President Trump is trying to stop it for the sake of our country
House Republican leaders, facing a revolt among conservatives and moderates in their ranks, pulled legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act aka Obamacare!
The new administration’s inability to pass the bill provided a humiliating political black eye for the White House, Ryan and the Republican Party — along with a major legislative failure for Trump.
Well, we have another traitor caught on camera!
According to The Daily Caller:
Former Speaker of the House John Boehner said Republicans will not be able to repeal and replace Obamacare at a closed-door trade show in Las Vegas, Nev., Friday.
Boehner told a private crowd that Americans and state officials are used to Obamacare, saying it will never be repealed or replaced, in a video obtained by The Washington Post released Tuesday.
The former speaker warned Republicans that if they fail to pass their healthcare, taxes and infrastructure legislation, “they’re going to get annihilated” in the 2018 midterm elections.
“Here we are, seven months into this year, and yet they’ve not passed this bill. Now, they’re never — they’re not going to repeal and replace Obamacare,” Boehner said. “It’s been around too long. And the American people have gotten accustomed to it. Governors have gotten accustomed to this Medicaid expansion, and so trying to pull it back is really not going to work.”
Boehner suggested if the GOP can’t get rid of Obamacare, leaders should get rid of some of the taxes and regulations of Obamacare and stop health insurance mandates.
“When it’s all said and done, you’re not going to have an employer mandate anymore, you’re not going to have the individual mandate,” Boehner said. “The Medicaid expansion will be there. The governors will have more control over their Medicaid populations and how to get them care, and a lot of ObamaCare taxes will probably go.
This is why President Donald Trump on Sunday evening again called on Republicans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, adding in a veiled threat that the “repercussions will be far greater” than lawmakers might expect.
Obamacare was/is a disaster and certainly NOT AFFORDABLE! I know people who don’t have insurance due to it doubling in price.

"HISTORIC CONSEQUENCES!! In Warsaw Speech, Trump Says What No President Has Dared To Say","President Trump Salutes People of Poland: “One Million Poles Sang Three Simple Words ‘We Want God!’”
Last week, President Trump made a visit to the nation of Poland. While there he spoke to the Polish people from Krasinski Square in Warsaw. The speech he made was as usual attacked by the media elite as being “nationalist” and other less polite terms. But what he said was truly amazing.
His words left no doubt as to pride in the Polish people and their history fighting off aggressor after aggressor. Trump also told about “western values” that signify who the Polish people are. The land of Poland is ripe with culture and history that stands for self-determination as a people.
The setting for the speech was perfect as the Square holds a monument that honors the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against the N*zis. The message also praised Poland for its stand against communism.
“A million Polish people did not ask for wealth. They did not ask for privilege. Instead, one million Poles sang three simple words: ‘We want God,’” Trump said.
He added: “As I stand here today before this incredible crowd, this faithful nation, we can still hear those voices that echo through history. Their message is as true today as ever. The people of Poland, the people of America, and the people of Europe still cry out ‘We want God.’”
“We can have the largest economies and the most lethal weapons anywhere on earth. But if we do not have strong families and strong values, then we will be weak and we will not survive,” Trump said.
It is not surprising that mentioning “God” opened the MSM floodgates of criticism. Trump was making a comparison of the “We want God” comment to 1979 when Pope John Paul II visited his homeland. His visit paved the path for keeping the Soviet Union from gaining access to Poland. However, his words were out of context by the media liberals.
John Harwood of CNBC only used the three-word quote talking about Trump’s speech never mentioning the reason behind the words. Ignorant leftist tweeters responded with things like;
What an embarrassment. #25AmendmentNow #25for45,” said one Twitter user.
Another said, “We know the only person you worship is in the mirror. Sad pathetic man.”
Yet another user added, “That’s such a disgusting statement to come out of his mouth that I want to wash his mouth out with soap.”
Anyway, Trump is to be congratulated for such a warm, genuine and articulate speech. His words were spot on and the world listened with attention. After 8 years of apologies by a worthless President, seeing this man speak with heart was remarkable.
Watch the whole inspiring video especially around the 20:30 mark for the “we want God” assertion:

James Comey’s good friend might just be the final nail in the “Comey Coffin”
Benjamin Wittes is a longtime friend of James Comey, is the editor-in-chief for the blog Lawfare and is a former editorial writer for the Washington Post. He just dropped a BOMBSHELL that could get Comey in major trouble.
Wittes says Comey has been leaking to him “over the previous few months” and has even disclosed information to him about the infamous Trump-Comey dinner. In his May 18 post, he issued a long story describing the relationship and what he knew. So how long was Comey leaking?
Comey has already admitted to leaking his “memos” to another friend so he could give them to the New York Times. After this, Trump Tweeted that Comey may have been the “leaker” this whole time. Now yesterday, the Daily Mail caught Comey walking into the New York Times building! SHARE this on Facebook if you think James Comey should be held accountable for all these leaks!
Wittes seems to try and downplay what Comey has told him. He says what they discussed shouldn’t be considered “leaks”. That’s kind of hard to believe, though. If you know something that nobody else knows except for workers at the Federal Bureau of Investigation… that seems like a leak. What’s worse- the person who told you is the head of the FBI!
James Comey tells his friend Benjamin Wittes about his interactions with Donald Trump. Since Wittes is a good friend, he waited until after Comey was fired to post it all. He knew if he posted what Comey told him the next day he would be in trouble. Is it too far out to think that Comey knew Wittes could write these stories if he was fired? What if he called him and gave him the “go ahead”? Breitbart reports that Wittes contacted the New York Times with his story and even later discussed it in a BuzzFeed interview. Even today, James Comey was spotted entering the New York Times.
We don’t know exactly what else James Comey told Benjamin Wittes in their frequent altercations, but we do know that Comey is not being held accountable. How can this guy admit in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee that he leaked information to reporters and get away with it? What is the next thing we find out about Comey and Wittes says, “Oh, right, I knew that. I just forgot. Everybody else knows it now, though, so it’s not a crime”?
James Comey deserves to be held accountable.

Johnny Depp On Trump: ‘When Was The Last Time An Actor Assassinated A President?’ (Video),"Actor Johnny Depp took to the microphone at the Glastonbury Music Festival on Thursday to lambast President Donald Trump.
Depp responded to the crowd saying, “Can we bring him here? He needs help.”
All of this seems rather innocuous and simply like another left-wing actor spouting off…until Depp decided to make an incendiary reference about Abraham Lincoln’s assassination saying, “When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?”
He then went on to deflect the implication of his statement with the cop-out of, “I’m not an actor. I lie for a living.”
BREAKING: Senate Unveils Its Obamacare ""Repeal""
Once again we are met with jokes about assassinating a sitting president as being suggestible and even ostensibly fine and dandy with a certain portion of the public. Depp is still an American citizen, after all. And of the four assassinated U.S. presidents, three have been Republicans.
These kinds of jokes wouldn’t have been funny seven months ago, and despite how anyone feels about what Trump is doing to America, they’re still not funny.
Of course, incendiary political language has been the fabric of American discourse since its inception. Burning leaders in effigy is something Americans and other Western nations have long held as an integral part of freedom of speech.
While Depp’s comments were cold and inflammatory, he had every right to say them…and we have a right to call out his nonsense.

Supreme Court's recent unity faces looming test,"U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts (seated C) leads Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (front row, L-R), Justice Anthony Kennedy, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Stephen Breyer, Justice Elena Kagan (back row, L-R), Justice Samuel Alito, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and Associate Justice...
WASHINGTON As the U.S. Supreme Court navigated a difficult period in which it was short one member for more than a year, justices from across the ideological spectrum often managed to find common ground. That sense of unity promises to be soon put to the test.
The nine-justice court ended its 2016-2017 term on Monday with a flurry of rulings. When it resumes work in October, its recently restored conservative majority could become more assertive as the justices tackle big cases on whether the U.S. Constitution lets businesses refuse to serve gay couples for religious reasons, presidential powers and manipulating electoral district boundaries for partisan gain.
Neil Gorsuch, Republican President Donald Trump's appointee, joined the court in April, giving conservatives a 5-4 majority. Gorsuch already has established himself as among the most conservative and outspoken justices even before beginning his first full term.
""We will certainly see more cases where they are sharply divided,"" Chicago-Kent College of Law professor Carolyn Shapiro said.
While partisan tensions in Washington have deepened since Trump took office in January, the Supreme Court largely remained above the fray.
In the 14 months that the court operated with only eight justices following Justice Antonin Scalia's death and was divided equally between liberals and conservative, it showed greater unanimity in its decisions than in recent years. During that time, the justices often sidestepped major rulings on divisive issues, resolving several cases narrowly and trying to avoid 4-4 votes that would leave legal questions unresolved.
The court even avoided a sharp ideological split in its decision on Monday on how to handle Trump's contentious order banning people from six Muslim majority countries from entering the United States. The four liberal justices were silent as the court allowed parts of the order to go into effect and agreed to decide the legality of the policy in its next term.
The court already has agreed to hear several major cases in which the justices are likely to be divided on ideological lines, including one on the conflict between gay rights and religious freedom concerning a Christian baker from Colorado who refused to make a cake for a same-sex couple, citing his religious beliefs.
The justices will also weigh whether state legislative districts violate constitutional protections if they are drawn purely to gain partisan advantage in a case involving a Republican-configured electoral map in Wisconsin that could have major consequences for U.S. elections.
The travel ban case, Trump's first big Supreme Court battle, is a major test of presidential powers, with Trump's administration arguing that the judiciary should show deference to the president on national security matters.
In the term that just ended, the court was able to decide all but two of the cases it heard. On Monday, the justices ordered that those cases, both on immigration-related issues, be re-argued in its next term, when Gorsuch would be able to participate. The action suggests the court was divided 4-4 along ideological grounds on those cases.
A review of rulings from the 2016-2017 term compared with previous years shows a higher rate of unanimity, likely prompted by the greater need for compromise without a decisive ninth vote.
In 69 cases in which the court issued decisions on the merits, there were no dissenting votes in 41 of them, or 59 percent, according to Kedar Bhatia, who compiles court statistics for the SCOTUSblog website. That compares with 44 percent in the court's previous term and 40 percent in the one prior to that.
""With only eight members, I think the court was trying harder to achieve as much agreement as possible, both in the close cases and in the not-so-close ones,"" said Kannon Shanmugam, a lawyer who regularly argues before the court.
While they were shorthanded, the justices took up fewer cases that were likely to divide them ideologically. For example, they took six cases on patent protections, a higher-than-normal number, on an issue in which they usually are unanimous.

Trump punches CNN in a juvenile tweet,"Our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy have changed.
 
by Brian Stelter @brianstelter July 2, 2017: 1:42 PM ET
President Trump is wrestling with challenges both at home and abroad -- but on Twitter he's wrestling with CNN.
On Sunday morning the president's personal Twitter account, which has 33 million followers, posted a 28-second video of a WWE broadcast. The video was edited to show Trump beating up a man with a CNN logo on his face.
A short time later, the official @POTUS Twitter account retweeted Trump's tweet to its 19 million followers.
It was another escalation in Trump's ongoing war against the news media -- and against CNN in particular.
Trump, a frequent CNN viewer, regularly lashes out at the network's coverage.
Some media figures expressed real concern that the video could encourage violence. Twitter had no immediate comment about whether the video violated its terms of service prohibiting ""hateful conduct.""
In a statement, CNN called it a ""sad day when the President of the United States encourages violence against reporters.""
The statement brought up the fact that Trump's deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said just a few days ago that ""the president in no way form or fashion has ever promoted or encouraged violence. If anything, quite the contrary.""
""Clearly"" Sanders ""lied,"" the CNN statement said.
""Instead of preparing for his overseas trip, his first meeting with Vladimir Putin, dealing with North Korea and working on his health care bill, he is involved in juvenile behavior far below the dignity of his office,"" the statement added. ""We will keep doing our jobs. He should start doing his.""
Several journalism advocacy groups also weighed in.
""We condemn the president's threat of physical violence against journalists,"" the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press said. ""This tweet is beneath the office of the presidency. Sadly, it is not beneath this president.""
Before becoming president, Trump sometimes appeared at WWE matches and occasionally joined in the fighting. So it was relatively easy for someone to tweak the old video and superimpose the CNN logo onto the other fighter's face.
Who created the anti-CNN video? There was no immediate answer, but a version of the video appeared on a pro-Trump Reddit thread several days ago.
Some commentators, especially those inclined to support Trump, laughed at the video and savored the president's latest media critique.
Others derided the video as juvenile and unbecoming of the U.S. president.
Infographic: Trump tweets and the TV news stories behind them
""It's not just anti-CNN. It's anti-freedom of the press,"" CNN political analyst Carl Bernstein said on ""Reliable Sources"" on Sunday. ""It's very disturbing. There's nothing lighthearted about it whatsoever.""
CNN, The New York Times, The Washington Post have been some of the president's recent targets.
On Saturday Trump tweeted that he wants to rebrand ""Fake News CNN"" as ""Fraud News CNN.""
Sunday's video reiterated that message with a Photoshopped ""FNN"" logo.
Several prominent Democrats, including House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, condemned the video.
""Violence & violent imagery to bully the press must be rejected,"" she wrote. ""This #July4th, celebrate freedom of the press, guardians to our democracy.""
Congressman Adam Schiff pointed out that a journalist in Montana was recently body-slammed by Greg Gianforte, a Republican businessman was running for office at the time. (Gianforte won the election the next day, and he is now in the House of Representatives.)
Putting the focus on Trump, Schiff asked, ""Where will his downward spiral take us?""
Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, was also critical of the latest Trump tweet.
""This has to stop -- we all have a job -- 3 branches of gov't and media,"" she tweeted. ""We don't have to get along, but we must show respect and civility.""
On ABC's ""This Week,"" Earlier on ABC, anchor Martha Raddatz asked Homeland Security Adviser Thomas Bossert to react to the video.
""No one would perceive that as a threat. I hope they don't,"" he said.
Ana Navarro disagreed. She called Trump's tweet ""an incitement to violence. He is going to get someone killed in the media."" Navarro, a Republican who is fiercely critical of the president, is a commentator on both CNN and ABC.
Some other Republicans suggested that there was an overreaction to the video.
Ben Ferguson, a conservative talk show host and CNN commentator, said he thought Trump's WWE tweet was one of the more ""humorous moments"" of the president's feud with the media.
""I don't think it incites violence,"" Ferguson said on ""Reliable Sources."" ""He's trying to make it abundantly clear that there are people in the media who have made it their personal mission and their job to destroy this president.""

"Trump Tweets That White House is ‘Functioning Perfectly,’ Promptly Gets His A** Handed to Him","July 12, 2017Samantha Layne News
Donald Trump Wants You To Think He’s Got It Handled
Donald Trump wants you to think he’s ok, the White House is ok, it’s all ok, we’re all fine. Really. No need to worry about anything. He is totally handling the country and the world and everything, and he’s so not spending every moment watching TV coverage, obsessing over it, and then rage-tweeting about it moments later.
And you can believe him because he tweeted about it.
The W.H. is functioning perfectly, focused on HealthCare, Tax Cuts/Reform & many other things. I have very little time for watching T.V.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2017
See? Donald Trump wants to you think he’s totally got it handled.
Unfortunately for the rest of us, he really doesn’t. What is the opposite of handled? Because whatever that is, that’s what Donald Trump is doing in the White House.
After all, he doesn’t have time for governing. He is actually too busy watching TV and then rage-tweeting about it.
Trump’s Perfectly Functioning White House
If his White House is “functioning perfectly,” then what the hell is this mess, reported here by the Washington Post?
“The White House has been thrust into chaos after days of ever-worsening revelations about a meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a lawyer characterized as representing the Russian government, as the president fumes against his enemies and senior aides circle one another with suspicion, according to top White House officials and outside advisers.
“President Trump — who has been hidden from public view since returning last weekend from a divisive international summit — is enraged that the Russia cloud still hangs over his presidency and is exasperated that his eldest son and namesake has become engulfed by it, said people who have spoken with him this week.”
Donald Trump’s own son just openly admitted to colluding with Russians during his daddy’s campaign. And, just in case you didn’t want to take him at his word, he tweeted out the actual emails saying so.
If I didn’t know any better, I would say that the White House is so not functioning perfectly…and that it is much too busy trying desperately to do damage control that they are focused on very little else.
In other words, health care, tax cuts and tax reform, along with those “many other things” are taking the backseat to the Russian scandal.

Ann Coulter Vs. Delta:  Airline And Firebrand In Heated Twitter War Over Her Pre-Booked Seat,"Published on July 17, 2017
Ann Coulter Vs. Delta: Airline And Firebrand In Heated Twitter War Over Her Pre-Booked Seat
Delta is learning why it’s not a good idea to tick off Ann Coulter.
She’s got Twitter and she’s not afraid to use it.
When she does, her scathingly witty tweets are bound to go viral.
If you’re not on Twitter, you don’t see how dark the Twitterverse gets.
It’s like the wild west out there.
It’s full of fun, but you’d better be packin’.
Because the limit is 140 characters, you have to be pithy and punchy.
Ann Coulter is already those things and has a 1.61M people following her.
That’s a PR nightmare.
The only thing that Delta could do worse than treating her badly is to challenge her on her claims.
To that, Delta says, ‘Hold my beer’.
The conservative commentator, 55, went into a Twitter tailspin when she was forced to give up her additional legroom seat, insulting Delta staff and her fellow passengers and even tweeting photos of them to her 1.6million followers on Saturday.
Delta, seemingly done with Coulter’s insults, tweeted at her Sunday night: ‘We’re sorry you did not receive the preferred seat you paid for and will refund your $30. (cont)’ and adding with a kick:
‘Additionally, your insults about our other customers and employees are unacceptable and unnecessary.’
But Delta’s response seemed to set Coulter off again, who was still tweeting around 2am eastern time on Monday morning.
Here is a condensed version of the exchange:
Just when you think it's safe to fly them again, the worst airline in America is STILL: @Delta

Gay marriage around the world,"Paris – Germany legalised gay marriage on Friday, which now is authorised in about 20 nations around the world, the majority of which are in Europe.
– European pioneers – In April 2001 the Netherlands became the first country in the world to allow gay and lesbian couples to marry in a civil ceremony. Twelve European countries followed: Belgium, Britain (except Northern Ireland), Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.
About 15 western European countries allow same-sex couples to adopt children, whether within marriage or civil partnerships. They include Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden.Other countries, including Finland, Germany and Slovenia, let gay people adopt the children of their partners.
– Progress in the Americas – Canada led the way in North America, authorising same-sex marriage and adoptions in June 2005. In the United States, a Supreme Court decision in June 2015 legalised gay marriage nationwide. Chile’s civil union law recognises same-sex couples, and Costa Rica allows them to share health and pension benefits.
– Rare in Africa, Asia and Middle East – On the African continent, where around 30 countries ban homosexuality, only in South Africa can gays legally marry and adopt children. In the Middle East, Israel leads in terms of respect for homosexual rights, recognising gay marriages performed elsewhere even though such marriages are not performed in Israel itself.Gay couples can jointly adopt children.

WTH Is Going On With Pelosi? Bizarre NY Speech – Freezes And Stares At Audience [VIDEO],"This looks very bad for Nancy Pelosi. In the video below, she looks like she is having mini-seizures where her mind blanks out and she can no longer find the right words. And it happened over and over and over again. What she did say while speaking during the event, pretty much made no sense. Not to be overly dramatic, but this is the kind of behavior you see in Parkinson’s patients. It goes beyond brain freeze… there is something wrong with Nancy Pelosi.
It couldn’t come at a worse time for the old moonbat either. She’s in the fight of her political life. Even her own party wants her gone after a string of special election losses where Republican candidates successfully tied Pelosi to the Dem candidate and beat them because of it. But she’s not budging. She’s arrogantly digging in. However, if there is someone wrong with her, she won’t be able to hold on long and I think her age and all that Botox are finally taking their toll on her.
From The American Mirror:
As Nancy Pelosi struggles to beat back an insurgency by her House Democratic colleagues over a string of election losses, there are new questions over her health after she suffered multiple brain freezes during a recent appearance in New York City.
During a Sunday event at the 92nd Street Y, Pelosi would awkwardly stop mid-sentence repeatedly, stare at the audience, and then continue speaking.
Speaking about her father, Pelosi said, “He was part of a group called the Berkson Group and they did rallies and pageants and parades and um, and when he stood up on the floor of Congress, ‘I stand here as a representative of the—” she said before halting and staring at the audience.
Then she resumed, “members of the Jewish army.”
It’s one thing to lose your train of thought… it’s quite another to reach for a word or sentence and not be able to find it. And ironically, it’s not just Pelosi who has had these episodes. Hillary Clinton has them frequently and so does Maxine Waters. Perhaps all that progressive vileness is finally catching up with these cloven harpies. While she was talking about planning an agenda after losing four special elections, she said, “For us, we have to make sure that our members—-participate in that.” She proceeded to prod Dems into telling their Obamacare stories: “At least go to Facebook, Twitter, whatever— Instagram— any platform that you want.” Whatever? Geez… that’s desperate.
Pelosi was far from done. Next she went after the Republican healthcare bill, “Home care— some, you know, people are at home but they still get care from, uh— from Medicaid,” she said, and then another brain freeze hit and she just stared at the audience. Earth to Nancy! Perhaps Pelosi should get some medical attention… something’s just not right there. She then added, “It will have a tremendous impact on what families can do for their children—” she said, fluttering her hands and unable to get any words out, before finally saying, “with relationship to what they need to do.” I think I speak for all of us when I say, huh?
Pelosi’s odd behavior is not going to help her hold on to power in her own party. Many Democrats are voicing concerns over Pelosi now and with good reason both politically and now health-wise. This is beyond strange and is very worrisome. Somebody better find a doctor in the house.",Ihavethetruth,1
WATCH: Muslims Try to Force Americans to Submit to Sharia Law… BIG MISTAKE,"Joker 5 hours agoNews, Politics, USA, World120 Views
Are Muslim immigrants really all peaceful people just looking for a better life and the American dream?
If the following video tells you anything it’s that Muslim immigrants do indeed have a dream, but it’s not the American dream. It’s a dream of America SUBMITTING to Sharia Law.
They may not yet have the numbers, but that isn’t stopping some Muslim immigrants from trying to FORCE American Christians to bow before Islam.
In this disturbing footage, a gang of Muslim thugs surrounding a Christian in Dearborn, Michigan and attacks him for, well, not being Muslim.
Police and local security intervene and put down the assailants. But this is happening – not in the Middle East or Europe – right here in our own backyard, and its needs to be stopped.

'Quite odd': coral and fish thrive on Bikini Atoll 70 years after nuclear tests,"Scientists say marine life has proved ‘remarkably resilient’ despite the Pacific island being declared a wasteland in the 1950s

Scientists say marine life has proved ‘remarkably resilient’ despite the Pacific island being declared a wasteland in the 1950s
Saturday 15 July 2017 01.54 EDTFirst published on Friday 14 July 2017 18.42 EDT
The former island paradise of Bikini Atoll is slowing blooming back to life, 70 years after the United States dropped 23 nuclear bombs on it, including a device in 1954 that was 1,100-times larger than the Hiroshima atom bomb.
A team of scientists from Stanford University have been surprised to discover an abundance of marine life apparently thriving in the crater of Bikini Atoll, which was declared a nuclear wasteland after the bombings, with its 167 inhabitants relocated to other islands.
Building the atom bomb: the full story of the Nevada Test Site
Steve Palumbi, a professor in marine sciences at the university, said the effects of radiation poisoning on ocean life have never been studied in-depth, and his team’s initial research suggests it is “remarkably resilient”.
Animals studied by scientists in and around the Chernobyl blast showed deformities and mutations, but the Stanford teams initial research suggest the marine life in Bikini may have fared significantly better.

Palumbi’s team discovered a diverse eco-system of animal life in and around the bomb crater, including coral as big as “cars”, hundreds of schools of fish including tuna, sharks and snapper, and coconut crabs devouring radioactive coconuts on the shore.
Palumbi said to the naked eye the crabs, fish and coral of Bikini Atoll look perfectly normal and healthy, and some of the coral has been around for decades – with evidence it may have begun growing as soon as 10 years after the last bombs were dropped.
“The lagoon is full of schools of fish all swirling around the living coral. In a strange way they are protected by the history of this place, the fish populations are better than in some other places because they have been left alone, the sharks are more abundant and the coral are big. It is a remarkable environment, quite odd.”
Palumbi’s team concentrated their research efforts on the coral and coconut crabs – which are the size of hub caps – because they have long-life spans, allowing the scientists to delve into what effect the radiation exposure has had on the animals DNA after building up in their systems for many years.
Because fish have relatively short life-spans it is possible the worst-affected fish died off many decades ago, said Palumbi, and the fish living in Bikini Atoll today are only subject to low-levels of radiation exposure as they frequently swim in and out of the atoll.
“This is the most destructive thing we have ever done to the ocean, dropping 23 atomic bombs on it, yet the ocean is really striving to come back to life,” said Palumbi.
“The fact there is life there and the life there is trying to come back from the most violent thing we’ve ever done to it is pretty hopeful.”
Even though plant, animal and ocean life is showing strong signs of recovery, humans are still unable to live and work on the atoll, besides a few caretakers who bring food and water supplies with them, and keep up the islands facilities.

A United Nations report in 2012 said the effects of radiation were long-lasting. Special rapporteur Calin Georgescu, in a report to the UN human rights council, said “near-irreversible environmental contamination” had led to the loss of livelihoods and many people continued to experience “indefinite displacement”.
Bikini Atoll nuclear test: 60 years later and islands still unliveable
The water cannot be drunk because of continued contamination, the seafood cannot be eaten, and plants cannot be farmed because of contaminated soil.
More than half of the 167 original inhabitants of Bikini Atoll have now died, and many went to their graves still longing to return to their homeland.
According to a paper by Timothy J. Jorgensen, associate professor of radiation medicine at Georgetown University, former residents of Bikini Atoll started showing cancers related to radiation exposure in the 1960s. Those down-wind of the explosions had burns and depressed blood counts.
Those on islands further afield showed elevated risk for cancers, particularly thyroid cancers and leukaemia, and have been involved in a protracted compensation claim with the United States for decades.
“What happened to the Marshall Islanders next is a sad story of their constant relocation from island to island, trying to avoid the radioactivity that lingered for decades,” writes Jorgensen.
“Over the years following the testing, the Marshall Islanders living on the fallout-contaminated islands ended up breathing, absorbing, drinking and eating considerable amounts of radioactivity.”",The Guardian – US,0

The driver of a broiling tractor-trailer found packed with immigrants outside a Walmart in San Antonio was charged Monday in the deaths of 10 of his passengers and could face the death penalty.
In outlining their immigrant-smuggling case against James Matthew Bradley Jr., 60, federal prosecutors depicted the trailer as pitch-black, crammed with somewhere around 90 people or more by some estimates, and so suffocatingly hot that one passenger said they took turns breathing through a hole and pounding on the walls to get the driver's attention.
Bradley appeared in federal court on charges of illegally transporting immigrants for financial gain, resulting in death. The Clearwater, Florida, man was ordered held for another hearing on Thursday and said nothing in court about what happened.
Over the weekend, authorities discovered eight bodies inside the crowded 18-wheeler parked in the summer heat, and two more victims died at the hospital. Officials feared the death toll could rise because nearly 20 others rescued from the truck were in dire condition, many suffering from extreme dehydration and heatstroke.
Bradley told investigators that the trailer had been sold and he was transporting it for his boss from Iowa to Brownsville, Texas, and that he was unaware people were inside until he parked and got out to urinate.
After hearing banging and shaking, he opened the door and was ""surprised when he was run over by 'Spanish' people and knocked to the ground,"" according to the complaint.
Bradley allegedly told investigators that he knew the trailer refrigeration system didn't work and that the four ventilation holes were probably clogged. He also said he did not call 911, even though he realized several people already were dead.
The truck had an Iowa license plate and was registered to Pyle Transportation Inc. of Schaller, Iowa. Company President Brian Pyle said that he had sold the truck to a man in Mexico in May and that Bradley was an independent contractor who was supposed to deliver it to a pick-up point in Brownsville.
Pyle said he had no idea of any problems with the truck until the news media started to call Sunday following reports of the deaths in San Antonio.
""I'm absolutely sorry it happened. I really am. It's shocking. I'm sorry my name was on it,"" Pyle said, referring to the truck.
A passenger told investigators that he and others crossed the Mexican border into the U.S. by raft and were then guided into the trailer to be taken to San Antonio, which is about a 150-mile (240-kilometer) drive from the Mexican border, according to the criminal complaint. He said those in the truck were given no water or food.
The passenger said the immigrants inside the truck soon began to struggle to breathe and started passing out.
At least some of those in the truck were from Mexico and Guatemala, according to diplomats from the two countries.
Latin Americans who enter the U.S. illegally often rely on smuggling networks to guide them across the border, supply them with safe houses and give them rides in the U.S. to their destination.
""Even though they have the driver in custody, I can guarantee you there's going to be many more people we're looking for to prosecute,"" said Thomas Homan, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The Latest: 10th person dies after being found in hot truck
How smugglers use trucks with sometimes deadly results
The temperature in San Antonio reached 101 degrees (38 Celsius) on Saturday and didn't dip below 90 degrees (32 C) until after 10 p.m.
The tragedy came to light after a person from the truck approached a Walmart employee and asked for water late Saturday night or early Sunday morning, said McManus, the police chief. The employee gave the person water and then called police.
It was the latest smuggling-by-truck operation to end in tragedy. In one of the worst cases on record in the U.S., 19 immigrants locked inside a stifling rig died in Victoria, Texas, in 2003.
Immigrants' rights activists have blamed federal and Texas authorities' hard-line immigration policies for contributing to the deaths by forcing migrants to take greater risks to reach the U.S.
""These tragedies are compounded when it's incredibly dangerous and incredibly expensive and we push migration into the hands of illicit actors,"" immigration activist Bob Libal said.
In the May 2003 case, the immigrants were being taken from South Texas to Houston. Prosecutors said the driver heard them begging and screaming for their lives but refused to free them. The driver was sentenced to nearly 34 years in prison.
The Border Patrol has reported at least four truck seizures this month in and around Laredo, Texas. On July 7, agents found 72 people crammed into a truck with no means of escape, the agency said. They were from Mexico, Ecuador, Guatemala and El Salvador.
Authorities in Mexico have also made a number of similar discoveries over the years.
Associated Press writers Mike Graczyk in Houston, Elliot Spagat in San Diego, Peter Orsi in Mexico City and Frank Bajak in San Antonio contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to show that people at the vigil in San Antonio held signs saying ""No human is illegal,"" not ""No human is legal.""

All those allegations of ‘fake news’ — the corruption is more egregious than even some cynics thought. It’s not about news at all; it’s all about the ratings. The Russia story has made CNN millions.
The salacious anti-Trump stories are more important than the journalistic ethics that are supposed to give them special status.
The nice cutesy little ethics that used to get talked about in journalism school, you’re just like, That’s adorable. That’s adorable. This is a business.
This was the video:
The CNN employee said what the rest of us have been thinking. After mentioning all the leaks that have come pouring out of Washington, he added: “If they had anything, it would have come out by now.”

With this video revelation, maybe the White House was right not to make it easy for them to feed their ratings and fake their stories by excluding cameras.
And maybe relegating CNN to the back row was actually BETTER than they deserved.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz Aide Arrested On The Way To Pakistan. The Reason…OMG!,"Forget about the Russia scandal. While the media’s attention has been pivoted on imaginary stories involving President Trump and Vladimir Putin, Democrats have been perpetuating a massive fraud.
This week, an aide of former party chairman Debbie Wasserman Shultz was arrested for bank fraud.
“Imran Awan, 37, of Virginia, pleaded not guilty to one count of bank fraud after the arrest. Federal authorities said Awan allegedly tried to get a $165,000 home equity loan through the Congressional Federal Credit Union for a rental property, which violates the credit union’s policy because it is not the owner’s primary residence…The $165,000 was then transferred to two people in Faisalabad, Pakistan.”
Awan was arrested while attempting to flee to Pakistan. Prosecutors believe that he had no intention of ever returning to America.
“This is clearly a right-wing media-driven prosecution by a United States Attorney’s Office that wants to prosecute people for working while Muslim,” Awan’s defense attorney, Chris Gowen said. “A quick glance at what the government filed in court today confirms the lack of evidence or proof they have against my client.”
Awan has been under investigation for months. He continued to work for Shultz even after his security clearance was denied. Why? Awan has worked for House Democrats for more than a decade, earning hundreds of thousands of dollars for himself and his family. Yet he filed for bankruptcy in 2012.
“Mr. Awan previously served as a part-time employee but his services have been terminated,” said Wasserman Schultz spokesman David Damron. “No charges, evidence or findings from the investigation have been formally shared with our office, so we cannot comment on them.”
Despite Damron’s comments, Rep. Schultz has so far refused to cooperate with Capitol Hill police.","Yes, I’m Right",1
New LPGA dress code rules spark debate,"CBS NewsJuly 19, 2017, 1:34 PM

The Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) made changes to its dress code for players that went into effect this week, issuing new guidelines banning leggings, ""plunging necklines"" and shorts or skirts that don't sufficiently cover a player's ""bottom area.""
The new rules have sparked a debate among current and former players and commentators, with critics saying the dress code is unnecessary and condescending, while supporters contend the changes were needed to clarify the existing dress code.
LPGA President Vicki Goetze-Ackerman sent an email to players on July 2 outlining the changes. Goetze-Ackerman said the dress code now prohibits the following:
The rules went into effect on Monday at the organization's Marathon Classic in Toledo, Ohio.
Heather Daly-Donofrio, a spokeswoman for the LPGA, told CBS News the dress code was updated at the request of players who wanted clarification on existing policies, calling the changes ""minor.""
House dress code to be modernized
U.S. Rep. Jackie Spier is making Friday ""Wear Sleeveless to Work Day"" at the Capitol, in response to House Speaker Paul Ryan's decision to change...
""Players asked us to update the existing dress code to include references relevant to today's fashion trends and golf wear,"" Daly-Donofrio said. ""If you're a fan watching the telecast this weekend, you're not going to notice a difference.""
Women in Sport, a British group that advocates for gender equality in sports, criticized the new policies, saying in a statement that ""women and girls should wear what makes them feel comfortable when taking part in sport.""
""We should always focus on the talent and athleticism of our female sport stars as opposed to their appearance,"" a spokeswoman for the group told the Golf Channel.
Some players said they were surprised by the reaction to the updated guidelines and brushed off the new rules.
""I honestly have been shocked by the response to it,"" 11-time LPGA winner Stacy Lewis said at the Marathon Classic. ""You look at other sports, the NFL, the NBA, they have a dress code when they're playing ... You guys with your jobs, you probably have a dress code, as well. I honestly don't understand the kick-back.""
Stacy Lewis hits her tee shot on the 12th hole during the third round of the 2017 KPMG Women's PGA Championship at Olympia Fields Country Club on July 1, 2017 in Olympia Fields, Illinois.
LPGA pro Christina Kim said players ""should look professional"" and defended the guidelines.
""Do you really need ventilation for your side-boob? It's not going to make your score better,"" she said, according to the Golf Channel.
However, not all players agreed with the move. Sandra Gal, another LPGA pro, said she agreed with the ban on low-cut tops, but has ""never really seen that be an issue."" She said she disagreed with the other restrictions.
""Our main objective is clear: play good golf,"" Gal said, according to the Golf Channel. ""But part of being a woman, and especially a female-athlete, is looking attractive and sporty and fit, and that's what women's tennis does so well. Why shouldn't we? I've talked to a few other players and, like me, they don't agree with it, either.""

Police allege Logan was engaged in criminal fraud for several years dating back to 2010 or earlier. They said Logan requested employees to ""call in"" regulated drug prescriptions for other employees. Those prescriptions were diverted for his or a family member's use.

Iran Is Pushing Israel and the Gulf Closer Together,"This could finally lead to regional security cooperation in the Middle East.
Emily B. LandauShimon Stein
The past years have seen positive winds blowing from the Gulf states toward Israel, in particular from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. These states are signaling their willingness—fueled by a common interest in confronting Iran—to step up cooperation with Israel, including elevating it to the public domain.
The new willingness of these states to explore expanded cooperation with Israel can be scrutinized and assessed in terms of its possible implications in three different contexts:
As a platform that can help achieve a grand bargain for peace between Israel and the Palestinians;
In terms of Israel-Gulf cooperation per se, and resulting normalization of relations with Israel;
And as a vehicle for encouraging the establishment of new regional dialogue frameworks in the Middle East, on topics of common interest.
Analysts and political figures have been assessing the emerging trends from different perspectives and with these different objectives in mind. The prism through which new offers of cooperation to Israel are assessed influences whether they are viewed more as a viable opportunity, or an unrealistic pipe dream.
At the center of these analyses is how one regards the centrality of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to Arab-Israeli politics, and the role that this conflict has played and continues to play in broader regional dynamics. Since the upheavals in the Middle East that began with the so-called Arab Spring, experts and politicians alike have come to recognize that the old axiom that the Arab/Palestinian-Israeli conflict is the core regional struggle is no longer valid. Indeed, this rather simplistic view has given way to a more nuanced approach which places the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (the resolution of which will no doubt contribute to regional stability), together with a host of other political, social, ethnic, religious and military conflicts in the Middle East. It is the collective resolution of all these conflicts that has the ability to pacify the region.
Nevertheless, when the primary frame of analysis for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is interpreting new signals from the Gulf, there is little interest in seriously considering Gulf-Israel cooperation outside a grand scheme to resolve this conflict. Absent such a plan, cooperation between the Gulf states and Israel would be rejected on the grounds that it is enabling Israel to pursue a path to better relations with its Arab neighbors while “bypassing” the difficult steps needed to move toward resolution with the Palestinians. Indeed, there would be reason to be suspicious of such a development and think that Israel is actually keen to get something valuable from these states. This is a strong perception in the region, especially as Israel never provided a serious response to the Arab peace initiative of 2002.
Similar thinking is likely to be featured in the analysis of the expected gains from Gulf-Israel cooperation in its own right. The reluctance in this case would not be on the basis of the potential value of cooperation, but rather because its feasibility would be questioned. Experts would be skeptical about the willingness of the Gulf states to openly cooperate with Israel without significant progress on the Palestinian front, even if the cooperation serves their interests. This is because the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab states have been linked to progress in the Israeli-Palestinian sphere for so many years.
This approach ignores the fact that Arab-Israeli normalization could be beneficial to both sides, not only to Israel, as well as the fact that the ability to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict obviously does not reside with Israel alone. Nevertheless, the manner by which the issue has been framed for years has created a self-imposed hurdle that could prove difficult to cross. Moreover, Arab public opinion is routinely recruited as a debilitating factor, tying the hands of Arab leaders even when their interest dictates greater cooperation with Israel.
And yet, when there are strong interests driving Arab states to cooperate with Israel, we have seen cooperation realized, without insisting on resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The most prominent example is when Egyptian president Anwar Sadat’s interest in regaining control of Sinai encouraged him to forge a peace treaty with Israel. Although Sadat included the Palestinian issue as part of the treaty negotiations, the result was a far cry from resolution of the conflict.

"Chinese exports, imports beat expectations in June","Beijing – Growth in Chinese exports and imports outstripped expectations in June, data showed Thursday, fuelling hopes of stability in the world’s second-largest economy.
Exports rose 11.3 percent from a year ago to $196.59 billion, the customs administration said, topping a Bloomberg News forecast of 8.9 percent.
Imports were up 17.2 percent year-on-year — compared with an expected increase of 14.5 percent — to $153.83 billion, lifting the trade surplus to $42.76 billion.
The latest data could soothe concerns that the Chinese economy is losing momentum as Beijing clamps down on free-wheeling credit and property purchases that have been key drivers of growth for years.
It also comes ahead of US-China talks in Washington next week where they are expected to assess the results of a 100-day action plan aimed at improving trade ties between the economic rivals.

"CBSE revaluation 2017 class 12: Good news for students, revaluation of marks starts today; last date July 7",". (PTI)
CBSE revaluation 2017 class 12: In some good news for lakhs of students under the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), the board will accept requests for a re-evaluation of Class 12th. In a report by Deccan Chronicle, the deadline to apply for evaluation is 7 July. CBSE will consider re-evaluation for for Class 12th, along with two English electives offered by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and CBSE. According to the report, a notification by CBSE which said,”Request for a maximum 10 questions in theory portion in twelve subjects will be entertained at the rate of Rs 100 per question. Request for scrutiny of the marks will only be accepted once.” Students must note that only those who applied earlier for the photocopy of their answer sheets can apply for revaluation. The decision to re-start re-evaluation of answer sheets of Class 12 students came after the Delhi High Court had questioned the education board for scrapping the re-evaluation system.
CBSE had decided to do away with the re-evaluation system this year but the decision was not welcomed by the Delhi High Court. The Court had accepted a petition filed by some students challenging the CBSE’s decision, according to Firstpost.

Jet engine blast kills tourist on Caribbean beach,"CBS/APJuly 13, 2017, 11:01 AM
 
This undated photo provided by The St. Maarten/St. Martin Tourism Bureaus shows an Air France jet flying above Maho beach on the island of St. Martin in the northeast Caribbean.
Last Updated Jul 13, 2017 7:32 AM EDT
PHILIPSBURG, St. Maarten -- A New Zealand tourist has been killed by the blast from a jetliner taking off at a seaside airport in the Dutch Caribbean territory of St. Maarten, officials said Thursday.
The 57-year-old woman was knocked into a wall as she tried to cling to a fence to feel the blast on Wednesday, police spokesman Ricardo Henson said by phone. He said the woman was taken to the hospital, where she was declared dead. Her name wasn't released.
Rolando Brison, director of tourism for the island of St. Maarten, told the New Zealand Herald that he spoke to the victim's family.
""Yes, the family did confirm that (she was a New Zealander) to me,"" he said. ""And we're so sad to hear that. At this time I only wish to express my deepest sympathy to the family and loved ones while we continue to investigate what transpired just hours ago.""
Henson said hundreds of tourists regularly ignore multiple warning signs to not stand by the fence at the Princess Juliana International Airport, which is less than 200 feet from the beach in the tiny territory.
""Many people come just for the thrill of this main attraction, and unfortunately this time someone lost their life,"" he said.
Henson said dozens have been injured in recent years by the jet blasts, but this is the first time someone has died.
""It's very dangerous,"" he said. ""It goes on all day, every day.""
Over the years, vacationers and airplane buffs have posted numerous videos on YouTube showing the hair-raising moments as planes come in for a landing right over the beach and the powerful forces of jet engine blasts knock people off their feet.

"Deranged Trump Lawyer Threatens Man Via Email: ‘Watch Your Back, B*tch’","Marc Kasowitz is President Trump’s personal attorney for the Russia case and has represented him in various matters over the years, including the failed defense of the president in the Trump University lawsuit.
Kasowitz, it now appears, has one hell of a temper, much like his famous client.
A public relations executive who asked not to be identified read an article by ProPublica this week detailing the somewhat sordid past of Kasowitz and decided to email the attorney with a subject line which read, “Resign Now.”
Most lawyers would ignore such an email, but Kasowitz went into an online rage, firing off a series of angry missives, one of which stated:
“I’m on you now. You are fucking with me now Let’s see who you are Watch your back , bitch.”
In another email, Kasowitz told the PR exec:
“Call me. Don’t be afraid, you piece of shit. Stand up. If you don’t call, you’re just afraid. I already know where you live, I’m on you. You might as well call me. You will see me. I promise. Bro.”
The man Kasowitz harassed online forwarded the attorney’s emails to the FBI so there would be a record just in case the enraged Kasowitz followed through on this threats.
Danielle Citron, a University of Maryland law professor and the author of a book on online harassment said it might be possible to charge Kasowitz with issuing a direct threat:
“’I already know where you live’ and ‘you will see me. I promise.’ That’s incredibly troubling language. If I’m a prosecutor I’m going to think hard about that.”
No wonder Trump wanted Kasowitz to represent him. It sounds like Kasowitz, much like Trump, loves to issue empty threats, as if he’s some kind of mafioso. But also like Trump, I’m willing to bet that deep inside Kasowitz is nothing more than a terrified little wimp pretending to be tough.

Welfare Taker Turned Congresswoman Wants To Drug Test High Income EARNERS For Tax Deductions,"Rep. Gwen Moore (D-WI) has introduced her “Top 1% Accountability Act” to get revenge on states who drug test welfare recipients for government assistance eligibility.
She claims this legislation will make things more fair between the classes, because we all know that punishing job creators & higher scale consumers will improve the economy… Or will it?
Moore’s new law would require anyone claiming itemized tax deductions of over $150,000 in a given year to submit a clean drug test. If a filer doesn’t submit a clean test within three months of filing, he won’t be able to take advantage of tax deductions like the mortgage interest deduction or health insurance tax breaks.
Her office has calculated that the people impacted will be those who make at least $500,000 a year.
According to her unqualified logic,
By drug testing those with itemized deductions over $150,000, this bill will level the playing field for drug testing people who are the recipients of social programs.
How Does Her Law Help The Poor, Who Need Jobs & A Better Life?
While you ponder this deep question, let’s learn a little bit more about this Congresswoman to understand her reasoning.
By the way, you can learn a lot from someone’s history, & how they use their own experiences to shape the future.
So, Gwen had a tough time earlier in her life, as she recounts to us:
I am a former welfare recipient. I’ve used food stamps, I’ve received Aid for Families with Dependent Children, Medicaid, Head Start for my kids, Title XX daycare [subsidies]. I’m truly grateful for the social safety net.
As a result of her own past history of taking charity from the tax payers, we are supposed to trust her expertise in returning America to prosperity. So far, the only quality we can glean from her rationale is that we should feel sorry for poor people who use drugs & need money they didn’t earn. Then she thinks wealthy people are meanies who deserve to be drug tested to get back the money THEY EARNED, & our government took from THEM.
The left wing mindset is backwards, leading to ridiculous assertions like THIS from the Congresswoman:
…poor people…are entitled to things like Medicaid and SNAP [food stamps]. People who take tax deductions and particularly those in the top 1 percent…are not entitled to anything.
The leftists also believe that these job makers benefit from a large pot of ‘government money’. They fail to realize, all money garnered by the government is not the government’s property. The revenue belongs to the tax payers who EARNED it. This fatal flaw in philosophy claws away at the very fabric of the American spirit, rendering society into a pathetic pile. Treating hard working earners like disinherited step children will only cause more division & less motivation for productivity.
But her reasoning gets worse…
She decides upon the straw man argument of hyperbole, accusing conservatives of treating all poor people like criminals. This assertion does absolutely NOTHING to mute the welfare drug testing argument, & only succeeds in muddying the waters for welfare abusers to escape with other people’s money.
Republicans continue to criminalize poverty and to put forward the narrative, the false narrative in fact, that people who are poor and reliant upon the social safety net are drug users.
While it is true that drug use crosses all class lines, there is a stark contrast in economic failure factors between the rich & poor who partake in drugs.
The top earners are job creators, who expand their wealth by reinvesting their profits into new industries, which gives poor folks the opportunity for employment, where they can be productive & improve the economy.
As a result of emerging enterprises, maybe these less fortunate souls can someday become wealthy if they work hard with some ingenuity. In fact, many have lifted themselves out of poverty in this way.
Wealthy business owners have taken great risks, investing sacrificial amounts of their own time & money to open a company, with no guarantee of success. Finally, they have reached their goals, only to be met by the jealousy of class warriors whose only end game is to make everyone equally destitute, no matter how destructive this is to America’s economic health.
If any of these financially successful individuals are guilty of illegal drug use, it has no correlation to their economy bolstering capabilities, or they would not be successfully running a business. They are providing an increase in the factors which improve the lives of anyone willing to get up & do something with their life.
On the flip side, welfare recipients are receiving cash payments for ZERO productivity in society.
The sole purpose of welfare is to provide poor people with the temporary tools for fitness to enter the workforce & contribute their fair share of energy to world’s well being. Consequently, it is very generous of the taxpayers to give you all the amenities you need, until you return the favor by helping someone else with your tax dollars.
So, how can a welfare recipient fulfill their responsibility of returning to work as soon as possible when they are ingesting mind & body damaging substances?
The Truth About Drug Use & Employment
Most illegal drugs are detrimental to productivity, causing its users to miss nearly 2 times as many work days as non users. But this is not the only danger in drug use.
Here is an ample list of likely behaviors from drug abusers:
* Personality change – mood swings, anxiety, depression, lack of impulse control, suicidal thoughts or gestures
(U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, n.d.) Job Accommodation Network
Virtually all of those scenarios result in lower productivity at a job, & more importantly for our current argument, a much lower chance to gain employment.
Instead of class envy, we should actually fix the problem with real world motivation. After all, humans are driven by risk/reward incentives.
Most people on the welfare rolls have no incentive to get a job if the government keeps giving them all they need to survive. If they are not tested for use, they can continue to steal tax payer contributions & sustain their downward spiral of failure through illicit substance abuse, with little chance of securing employment.
So, if we test welfare takers for drug use, they are now accountable for their acceptance of charity, & must clean up their act to continue receiving funds, thereby enhancing their ability to work & raise their living standards.
This, in conjunction with time limits on welfare, will often make these recipients more attractive to employers who seek quality workers. Instead of a pot head wasting his days on the couch in a haze, we get a clear head seeking a better lifestyle through career opportunities.
Wealth Cannot Be Gained With Poor Ideas
Congresswoman Moore is suffering from the same disease as her leftist colleagues. They all mistakenly believe that prosperity grows by taking wealth away from rich people & redistributing it to the poor.
This poor thesis is explained by their own feelings about fairness, which has no roots in truth.
In a world built by specific logical laws, we need these rational concepts to govern the efficient operation of our population.
If you are intellectually honest, you will ask how most wealthy people gain wealth. Then you will realize that it often takes more than a pile of money to build & maintain the economy. It takes intelligent, ambitious people who are willing to take great risks for the chance to be great.

A federal judge has expanded the list of family members allowed to travel to the U.S. from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria or Yemen.

The number of people covered by President Trump's travel ban dropped again this week after the State Department issued new guidance to its offices around the world.
State issued the new guidelines late Monday to comply with an order from a federal judge in Hawaii, who ruled that the Trump administration was using too narrow a definition of family when deciding who was affected by the ban.
The travel ban went into effect June 29 following a Supreme Court ruling. It restricts travel from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, and limits all refugee admissions for 120 days.
The Supreme Court is scheduled to decide the overall legality of the ban in the fall, but it allowed a scaled-down version of the ban to go into effect. The court ruled that travelers from the six targeted countries can bypass the travel ban and enter the U.S. if they can prove they have a ""bona fide"" relationship with a U.S. person or entity.
The Trump administration defined that close relationship as immediate relatives, including parents, children, spouses and fiancées. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Hawaii ordered the administration to include more relatives, including grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, cousins and in-laws.
The Trump administration also ruled that refugees that had been matched up with a resettlement agency in the U.S. did not constitute a close enough relationship to sidestep the travel ban. Watson disagreed, ordering the administration to allow those refugees in.
The State Department updated its website on Monday to comply with Watson's orders. It included the expanded list of family relationships, and informed would-be travelers who were denied a visa based on the travel ban to check back with U.S. consulates to see if their visa can now be approved.
Trump's scaled-back travel ban goes into effect
More refugees, relatives to be exempt from Trump's travel ban, U.S. judge rules
Trump's immigration stance fuels opposition with millions in donations and volunteers
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has not announced how it will handle Watson's ruling. While State officials grant visas, CBP agents who screen inbound passengers at U.S. airports are the ones who make the final decision to admit a foreigner into the country.
The Justice Department, meanwhile, will continue fighting back against Watson's ruling. Attorney General Jeff Sessions accused the judge of micromanaging the executive branch, and said he had ""undermined national security"" and ""violated a proper respect for separation of powers."" Justice lawyers are appealing Watson's ruling to the Supreme Court.
For now, it remains unclear how many people are now restricted by Trump's travel ban. As opposed to the first travel ban that was in effect for a week in January, the current one does not bar legal permanent residents, people who already have visas, and those with a ""bona fide"" relationship with U.S. people or entities.

Qatar to respond after Arab nations extend deadline,"Kuwait City – Qatar was to respond on Monday after Saudi Arabia and its allies gave a defiant Doha another 48 hours to accept a series of demands or face further sanctions.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt announced in the early hours of Monday they were pushing back a deadline for Qatar to agree to a list of 13 demands they issued on June 22.
A joint statement said they were extending the ultimatum, which had been due to expire at the end of the day on Sunday, at the request of Kuwait’s emir.
Kuwait, which has been acting as a mediator in the crisis, has received assurances that “Doha would submit its official response to the demands to Kuwait on Monday,” the statement said.
Doha said Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani would deliver its response by hand to Kuwait’s emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad Al-Sabah.

DOHA The United States and Qatar signed an agreement on Tuesday aimed at combating the financing of terrorism, as U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Doha to try to end a month-long rift between Western-allied Arab states.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt imposed sanctions on Qatar last month, accusing it of financing extremist groups and allying with the Gulf Arab states' arch-foe Iran, something Doha denies.
Tillerson said the agreement signed with his Qatari counterpart, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, had been under discussion for months.
""The agreement which we both have signed on behalf of our governments represents weeks of intensive discussions between experts and reinvigorates the spirit of the Riyadh summit,"" Tillerson said at a joint news conference with Sheikh Mohammed.
U.S. President Donald Trump met representatives of Arab states during a visit to Saudi Arabia in May.
""The memorandum lays out a series of steps that each country will take in coming months and years to interrupt and disable terror financing flows and intensify counter terrorism activities globally,"" Tillerson added.
Sheikh Mohammed said the agreement was not linked to the crisis with the four Arab countries, which the United States fears could impact its military and counter-terrorism operations and increase Iran's influence in the region.
Tehran has sent food supplies to Qatar and allows the country's carrier to fly through its airspace.
Qatar denies it supports militant organizations and says the boycott is part of a campaign to rein in its independent foreign policy.
""Today, the state of Qatar was the first to sign the executive program with the United States to fight terrorism financing,"" Sheikh Mohammed told the news conference.
Tillerson said the agreement includes milestones to ensure both countries are accountable through their commitments.
""Together the United States and Qatar will do more to track down funding sources, will do more to collaborate and share information and will do more to keep the region ... safe,"" Tillerson said.
Accompanied by Kuwaiti mediators, Tillerson flew to Doha on Tuesday for talks with the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, over the crisis. He said he was due to travel to Saudi Arabia for talks with officials from the four Arab countries.
On Monday, he and British National Security Advisor Mark Sedwill met with officials from Kuwait in order to patch up the row among the Western-allied countries.
Following those discussions, the United States, Britain and Kuwait urged all parties to resolve their dispute quickly through dialogue, Kuwait state news agency KUNA reported.
Kuwait's ruler, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, expressed ""bitterness"" on Tuesday over what he described as an unprecedented rift in the Gulf, but said he intended to push ahead with mediation efforts.
Coming from some of the most influential powers in the dispute, the plea for a negotiated solution may be aimed at an earlier refusal by Qatar's adversaries to discuss renewing ties with Doha until it first acquiesced to a list of demands, including closing the Al Jazeera TV channel, shutting a Turkish military base in Qatar and downgrading ties with Iran.
Qatar hosts Udeid Air Base, the largest U.S. military facility in the Middle East, from which U.S.-led coalition aircraft stage sorties against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.

Activists Outraged As Women’s Golf Tournament Doesn’t Bend To Snowflake Syndrome,"Posted by Lawrence Clayton | Jul 13, 2017 | Breaking News
Protesters do not want the LPGA to host its tournament at this beautiful course because President Trump owns it.
Today in Bedminster, New Jersey, the 4 day U.S. Women’s Open golf championship begins. Seen by some as the biggest event in women’s golf, it has even more buzz this year. As with everything associated with his name, there is a lot of buzz, and protest, lately. That name is Trump, as in United States President Donald Trump.
While there is no groundbreaking news, or any controversial statements from the president, at least not lately or about golf, that is not stopping some women’s groups from protesting the golf event from being held at the beautiful, serene Trump National Golf Club.
Unsuccessful in their attempts to get the USGA to move the even to a different location has not stopped the calls from people who seem to still be upset about the November 8th decision by millions of Americans.
The USGA refused to move their biggest event from the Trump owned golf course.
Still upset about a leaked audio of President Trump, some women’s groups and Democrat senators attempted to pressure the USGA to move the event. At no point did the golf association seem willing to comply to the demands and teed off today at the course a few miles from its Falls Hills headquarters.
“We’re a golf organization,” said USGA CEO Mike Davis earlier this year. “We’re simply not going to cross that line into politics. We can appreciate that some people do, but we’re a golf association, and we’re sticking to golf.”
The USGA is likely betting that the number of people complaining is much smaller, but much louder, than the number of fans who either do not care about the location, like the president or just want to simply enjoy some golf.
“Holding the tournament on this course sends the exact wrong message,” says Shaunna Thomas, co-founder of UltraViolet, an anti-Trump women’s rights group that has been pestering the USGA for months. The group even plans to fly a banner above another golf championship in Wisconsin last month. The banner will supposedly tell the USGA to “take a mulligan, dump Trump.”
Michelle Wie is one of multiple players who did not care if the president was there, or not.
“They’re giving millions in revenue, free advertising and branding, to his platform and policies,” Thomas complains, “which repeatedly degrade women, and encourage hate and division.”
These political protests at sporting events do not sit well with the public. Sports are seen as an escape from politics, work and stress. Ask ESPN about its ratings as the very liberal sports network pushed more Democrat talking points than sports opinion.
Years ago, Michael Jordan did not mix sports and politics because he recognized, even Republicans buy shoes, but with ESPN being such a far left network, and the dominant sports network, it is getting harder and harder to keep the two separated.
Not taking heed to the possibility of backlash from conservatives, and moderates, Christine Brennan, USA Today’s veteran columnist, implores President Trump to “please stay away” even after he gets back from his Paris trip. Her plea is supposedly in consideration of the golfers, who Brennan feels Trump will distract from.
“Trump is such a polarizing and controversial figure that it’s safe to say that his presence will offend as many people as it encourages, if not more,” Brennan added.
The USGA is not interested in getting tangled up in politics.
Call it Trump derangement or snowflake syndrome, it’s real and it has tired out many American voters. This is another made up controversy, “fake news” some may say. Many presidents go to many sporting events, so that argument does not seem to be very sound, or legitimate. That feeling also doesn’t seem to coincide with the muted, golf course-esque quiet from the golfers and fans. The fans, and golfers, are calm, respectful, going about their business and not hyperventilating like the left is.
Some studies show that golf, both men’s and women’s, has a high turnout of conservative fans. So it is very doubtful the USGA wants to irritate, or alienate, those loyal fans who are looking to escape politics and enjoy a weekend of golf.
Even the golfers are not buying in to this hyperbolic demands from activists. Three-time Open winner Inbee Park said she is not surprised.
“I don’t think they will get any advantage from saying whether they agree or disagree, and I mean I don’t really think that really has much to say with me because I think it is really up to him whether he wants to come or not,” Park said.
The #1 women’s golfer is fine with Trump coming to their tournament. “He’s President of U.S. as well, so I think no matter his coming or not, the fact is not going to be changed.”
The #1 women’s golfer Ryu So-yeon, admits she does not follow U.S. politics but gets that playing on a Trump course will bring attention, but takes a very reasonable stance. “I know he’s a huge fan of golf. This is one of the biggest tournaments in U.S. and I strongly say this is best tournament in U.S. and everybody wants to win this tournament and, well, he’s President of U.S. as well, so I think no matter his coming or not, the fact is not going to be changed.”
Danielle Kang said, “We’re here to play a major championship hosted by the USGA,” reminding those questioning the location of why they are all there: golf. She says golfers are definitely going to be more comfortable talking about golf than politics.
Liberals are FORCING other people to be outraged, when fans and players are not. People either do not agree, do not care or do not think it’s relevant to sports. Either way, few are as outraged and losing it like the left is.
I am sure that it drives the liberal media insane that they cannot get these athletes to denounce, and insult the president, like they do at a rate of 93% of the time, but the rest of the public is giving these ladies a golf clap for their focus and courage.",Conservative Daily Post,1

WOW: Lindsay Lohan just STOOD UP for Trump; “Stop bullying him and start trusting him”,"July 5, 2017 Clayton
In a surprising turn of events, actress Lindsay Lohan tweeted out SUPPORT for Donald Trump over the 4th of July weekend. This is a stark contrast to most of the liberals in Hollywood, and it’s extremely refreshing to see.
On Monday, Lohan replied to a tweet with a screenshot of a Breitbart article about Trump’s willingness to help Charlie Gard, a baby in Britain whose parents are unable to afford to keep him on life support.
“THIS IS our president” Lohan tweeted. “Stop #bullying him & start trusting him. Thank you personally for supporting #THEUSA.”

"PSB stocks advance on value buying, brokerage upgrade","Another public sector lender — Bank of Baroda — gained over 3% during the day trade on NSE. (PTI)
Shares of public sectors banks rallied on Thursday as investors found value in beaten-down stocks and brokerages upgraded a few of them as valuations turned attractive after the recent correction amid NPA concerns. The Nifty PSU bank index bounced back from its recent fall and gained as much as 2.4% to close the session at 3,391.35 – its biggest single-day gain since May 25. The index had corrected 15% in the last six weeks and had declined 4% and 6% respectively in May and June. The fall in index in the previous two months was largely driven due to growing concerns over provisioning levels at a time when the sector was starting bankruptcy proceedings against 12 of the country’s largest loan defaulters.
Shares of Punjab National Bank rallied the most and gained 4.9% —its biggest single-day percentage gain in last five months —after Nomura upgraded the stock to ‘buy’ from ‘neutral’. “After the 24% correction in the past two months, we believe incremental risk-reward is turning favourable again for PNB,” said the foreign brokerage which foresees a 32% upside in the stock.
Near-term provisioning will remain elevated given the lower coverage of 41%, but large stock of prudentially written-off NPAs provides comfort on upgrades, Nomura added. Another public sector lender — Bank of Baroda — gained over 3% during the day trade on NSE. The stock had lost nearly 21% of its value in the last two months.
Domestic brokerage Edelweiss which retain its ‘buy’ rating on its attractive valuation observed, “After trailing industry average growth for past many quarters being in consolidation phase, now with internal restructuring and focus it should get back to industry average credit growth. This further supported by improved NIMs will support revenue growth traction.”
While the shares of State Bank of India gained 2.2% to close the session at `281, other public sector banks such as Allahabad Bank, IDBI Bank and Canara Bank added over 3% each.

"While GOP dithers, Trump makes another MAJOR move","There’s good news today as we’ve learned that President Donald Trump has ended the CIA’s program of arming the rebels in Syria – and the media has somehow managed to turn this into a “Trump/Russia” story.
Given that Russia is fighting in support of the Assad regime in Syria against various rebel groups, the Washington Post is reporting on the development as “Trump ends covert CIA program to arm anti-Assad rebels in Syria, a move sought by Moscow,” apparently unaware that Trump has opposed arming the rebels in Syria since before he declared his candidacy for president.
The so-called ‘moderate’ Syrian rebels pledged their allegiance to ISIS after Obama’s address. We should not be arming them!
Here's MY question for Jared Kushner New report holds dire warning about another attack like Benghazi
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 12, 2014
Anyway, the informational part of their article tells us that President Trump has decided to end the CIA’s covert program to arm and train moderate Syrian rebels battling the government of Bashar al-Assad.
The program was a central plank of a policy begun by the Obama administration in 2013 to put pressure on Assad to step aside, but even its backers have questioned its efficacy since Russia deployed forces in Syria two years later.
The shuttering of the program is also an acknowledgment of Washington’s limited leverage and desire to remove Assad from power. Officials said Trump made the decision to scrap the CIA program nearly a month ago, after an Oval Office meeting with CIA Director Mike Pompeo and national security adviser H.R. McMaster ahead of a July 7 meeting in Germany with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The problem was arming the so-called “moderate rebels” has always been that we don’t know how moderate they truly are. In fact, a CIA study published back in 2014 which examined nearly seventy years of data found that aid to insurgent groups had generally failed in instances when Americans didn’t work on the ground with foreign fighters (as has been the case with arming Syrian rebels).
In fact, the only example of success the study could find was when the CIA helped arm and train mujaheddin rebels fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s – and we all know who those “moderate rebels” later became.

A muscular handshake that turned their knuckles white seems to be giving way to a budding friendship between Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron.
The unexpected bromance between the leaders of America and France was on full display for the world Friday at the annual Bastille Day military parade and celebration in Paris. This year the event coincided with the 100th anniversary of the U.S. entry into World War I.
Trump spent a large portion of his day and a half in the French capital in the embrace of Macron, who went to extraordinary lengths to impress the U.S. president by turning a day of national pride into a celebration of American patriotism and friendship between the two countries.
Trump and Macron exchanged many handshakes during the course of Trump's first visit to France as president, perhaps none more telling than the one they shared after the parade. As Trump departed to head home to Washington, the leaders clasped hands and held on to each other as they walked. Trump at one point pulled the smaller Macron off balance and held fast as they approached their wives. Even then, Trump held on to Macron's hand as he shook hands with Macron's wife, Brigitte.
They appeared to have moved beyond that tense introduction in May, when a white-knuckle handshake that Macron later said was meant to show he's no pushover was widely interpreted as a sign of the fraught relations to come. Trump's brand of ""America First"" politics had unsettled some European allies.
But the body language in Paris this week suggested their relationship has moved to a new level. Both seemed to minimize differences in order to focus on areas where they can work together, such as the crisis in Syria and Mideast security.
Macron, in closing the parade, publicly thanked the U.S. for coming to France's aid during the war, saying ""nothing will ever separate us.""
""The presence at my side of the president of the United States, Mr. Donald Trump, and of his wife, is the sign of a friendship across the ages,"" Macron said. Trump made no remarks at the conclusion of the parade, but he returned the kindness in a statement released as Air Force One flew back to the U.S.
""America and France will never be defeated or divided,"" Trump said, adding that it was his ""high honor"" to commemorate, on French soil, France's most historic day and the 100th anniversary of the entry of the United States into World War I.
Despite major differences between the two leaders on such issues as climate change and trade, Macron nonetheless carved out time in his presidential schedule Thursday to lead Trump on a tour of the Les Invalides monument before Trump gave Macron a lift to the French presidential palace in his armored Cadillac limousine known as ""The Beast"" for their talks and a joint news conference.
They capped Thursday with a double dinner date with their wives at the famed Jules Verne restaurant in the Eiffel Tower.
Trump even declined a reporter's invitation during the news conference to repeat his past criticism of Paris, saying instead that the city's future is bright because France has a ""great"" and ""tough"" leader in Macron.
And Trump's fawning over Macron extended to Brigitte Macron, whose physical appearance he commented on. ""You know, you're in such good shape,"" Trump told the French leader's wife, before repeating his observation to her husband and adding ""beautiful.""
Macron and Trump both came to office as unlikely outsider candidates. At age 39, the youngest president of modern France — and the same age as Donald Trump Jr. — Macron started his own political movement just over a year ago. He won strong parliamentary majority and is riding high in the polls. Trump, on the other hand, is riding low in the polls at home and much of his agenda is stalled, despite sharing party control with both houses of Congress.
Macron is positioning himself to become Trump's European whisperer.
Yannick Mireur, a French political scientist, said Macron went into the meeting with ""a rather rare quality — that of empathy, interest in the person to try and understand him, to find the key to him.""
Both seemed to minimize their differences, said Spencer Boyer, a former national intelligence officer for Europe and fellow at the Brookings Institution. And Trump seemed to welcome a brief respite from all the focus back home on his son's meeting with a Russian lawyer during the presidential campaign.
""President Macron was highly skilled at putting President Trump at ease and avoiding any land mines that would have derailed the show of unity,"" Boyer said. ""Macron was especially adept at sidestepping questions about U.S. political controversies, which Trump clearly appreciated.""
Although the welcome may have taken some of the sting out of their first encounter, Macron's amiable meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel earlier Thursday showed the balance Macron appears to be striking.
Trump's parting tweet showed a photo of the two men looking out over the famed Champs-Elysees, standing shoulder to shoulder during what the American described as a ""magnificent #BastilleDay parade.""

"Huge News Just Broke About Bill Clinton, He Makes Major Announcement – No One Saw This Coming …","Since previous President Clinton left office in 2001, we were all trusting that he and Hillary would, as Barack and Michelle ought to, step away unobtrusively from open life and appreciate the life of retirement.Lamentably, that is not the situation. Rather, we’re past overexposed to the Clintons, as Hillary has now made two fizzled endeavors to wind up the president, and Bill has attempted to raise money for their slush support known as the Clinton Foundation.
Be that as it may, it’s not over for these Clintons. As Hillary has as of late reported her arrangements to bring cash up in talking expenses for a political activity advisory group, Bill Clinton has his very own few arrangements. What’s more, that is, to compose a novel. Maybe composing a legitimate and later collection of memoirs would demonstrate excessively, as Bill’s adventures in the current over a wide span of time may uncover too ersonmany skeletons. So fiction is a protected place for him.From Right Wing News:
Many people have been hoping that, with Hillary Clinton’s devastating loss in November, the Clintons would finally retire from the public eye. But that appears to not be true. Hillary has been making public speeches again, and now, Bill Clinton has just announced some new plans of his own.
Clinton said he is writing his first novel, alongside best-selling author James Patterson. The book, titled “The President is Missing”, will be released in June of 2018 and will be jointly published by Alfred A. Knopf and Hachette, Clinton and Patterson’s respective publishers.
So far, not much is known about the plot of the novel. While the fictional president will be at the center of the story, all that has been said so far is that it will be “a unique amalgam of intrigue, suspense and behind-the-scenes global drama from the highest corridors of power”.
For his part, Clinton has spoken enthusiastically about the book. “Working on a book about a sitting President – drawing on what I know about the job, life in the White House, and the way Washington works – has been a lot of fun,” he said in a statement. “And working with Jim has been terrific. I’ve been a fan of his for a very long time. “
Maybe composing this novel will keep Bill occupied while Hillary is away on her talking visits to raise money. In any case, this book might be a sort of chronicled fiction, however, will most likely have more truth in it than Bill’s indictment hearing in Congress!

Seven More Planned Parenthood Facilities Close Permanently,"Written by Keely Sharp
Seven more Planned Parenthood facilities closed permanently on June 30th. SEVEN WHOLE FACILITIES across three states! Six of these conducted abortions. So by closing, thousands of lives will be saved. Praise the Lord!
According to Life Site, Planned Parenthood officials claimed that the closures were due to “an attempt to remain solvent amid fears that Medicaid reimbursements would be halted by Congress.” So they literally only feared that they would not be paid by the government for murdering unborn humans that they ripped from the womb.
President of Operation Rescue said, “It isn’t very often we see seven Planned Parenthood facilities close in one day. This may have set some kind of record. It is great news for women and their babies who will no longer be preyed upon for profit by Planned Parenthood in these communities,” he continued, “Many Planned Parenthood facilities survive only on on government funding. There are so many other reputable providers of legitimate healthcare for women out there. Even if every Planned Parenthood was shut down, no one would have to due without proper medical care. We should not be funding Planned Parenthood with our tax dollars.”
Medication abortion facilities that are closing as of June 30, 2017, include:
* Atlantic City Planned Parenthood, Atlantic City, New Jersey. (Cited “security” reasons for closure.)
Keokuk Health Center Planned Parenthood, in Keokuk, Iowa, a center that referred for abortions, will also permanently close on June 30.
Another Iowa medication abortion facility, Quad Cities Center Planned Parenthood in Bettendorf, is set to close once the building sells.
TRENDING ON EAGLE RISING
The closures continue a national trend of abortion facility closures that appears to have intensified since the election of President Donald Trump.
In order to prevent Planned Parenthood from expanding once again, please contact your Senators today and urge them to completely defund Planned Parenthood in the upcoming legislation to repeal and replace of Obamacare, which is expected to come up for a vote after the Independence Day break.
Planned Parenthood facilities need to continue to close. Abortions absolutely do not need to be funded by the government and the taxpayers. Abortion is murder.

BAM! Kasich Just Said These 2 Words That Will Stop Healthcare Debate In Its Tracks!,"Alice Ali 35 mins agoNews39 Views
If you’re like me, you are concerned about what is going to happen with healthcare in America.
I think we can all agree that the ACA, or Obamacare, is dying a painful death for many. People I know are getting letters saying that their coverage is going to end soon. States have either no insurers who will provide coverage, or possibly only one, so that there is no real choice.
But there’s components of the ACA that are good: being able to keep your child(ren) on your plan until they are age 26, for example. Or insurers not being allowed to deny coverage for pre-existing conditions. Or the part that makes it so that your insurance carrier can’t cut off your cancer treatment, for example, in the middle of treatment. This is all good stuff I think most of us would like to keep.
We are in the middle of a complicated battle, and it’s not just Democrats that are pushing back. Many GOP Senators are as well. And they are being joined by many GOP Governors as well.
Governor Kasich, for example, is concerned about the Medicaid cuts in his state of Ohio. According to him, this will affect people being able to obtain opioid addiction treatment. The current bill is projected to cut $772 billion in funding for the (Medicaid) program over a decade.
Governor Kasich, as well as Governors of the states of Arkansas, Alaska and Nevada are becoming very vocal with the Senators of their states regarding their concerns. And the bill cannot pass the Senate if more than 2 Senators vote no.
As it stands now, 9 Senators have publicly stated that the oppose the current Senate bill.
This is important stuff that affects all of us. Please SHARE and COMMENT your thoughts!

David Letterman and Sen. Al Franken team up to blame ‘Siegfried and Roy’ Koch for killing the planet,"10 Jul 2017 at 12:57 ET

Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story!
Former “Late Show” host David Letterman and Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) are teaming up to get out their frustrations about disinterest around climate change. So, the two teamed up with humor website Funny or Die to publish a series of videos named “Boiling the Frog with Senator Al Franken.”
The series titled is a reference the analogy former Vice President Al Gore crafted about how the slow warming of the globe makes people less likely to notice and thus less likely care. The two addressed topical issues such as Letterman’s absurdly long Santa beard, the coal industry and carbon prices.
Franken explains that the series is part of his effort to “fight back” against apathy surrounding the issue and call out those who disregard science.
“Since taking office, President Trump has decided to disregard science in order to repeatedly put the short-sighted interests of his friends in the fossil fuel industry ahead of the safety of our planet,” Franken said in a Q&A with the Associated Press. “We hope to bring some much-needed attention to this critical issue and ultimately, to help encourage people in Minnesota, Dave’s home state of Indiana and all Americans to make their voices heard and join the fight to combat climate change.”
It isn’t all jokes and humor, however. Letterman actually traveled to India in order to report on the ways in which the country is solving problems with their power grid while combatting climate change.
“To me, people ought to be aware of this, people ought to have this tucked in their wallet,” Letterman explained. “People ought to walk around with this every day in the back of their mind and people ought to be aware and be educated and looking forward to things that they might do to help their kids and their children’s kids…When you travel places … you see enormous solar installations, you see enormous wind farms that 10 years ago did not exist. I am aware firsthand through traveling here and abroad that people are aware of this and doing things about it.”
Working with Franken gave the two long-time friends the ability to joyfully collude over climate.
“He gives me hope, he gives me faith,” Letterman said of Franken.

"Castillo goes 8 innings, Reds top Miami 6-4, end 6-game skid","Miami Marlins' Dan Straily delivers a pitch during the first inning of a baseball game against the Cincinnati Reds, Sunday, July 30, 2017, in Miami. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)
 
MIAMI — Rookie Luis Castillo pitched a career-best eight innings, Tucker Barnhart drove in three runs and the Cincinnati Reds ended a six-game skid, beating the Miami Marlins 6-4 on Sunday.
Castillo (2-4) allowed one run on three hits, striking out six and walking one. He outpitched Dan Straily (7-7) — the right-handers were traded for each last January as part of a four-player deal.
The Marlins, who got a three-run homer from Marcell Ozuna in the ninth off reliever Raisel Iglesias, had their four-game winning streak snapped. NL home run leader Giancarlo Stanton was held out of Miami’s lineup for the first time since May 31.
Castillo and Miami starter Dan Straily (7-7) were involved in a trade for one another in January.
Castillo, who was the Marlins’ minor league pitcher of the year last season, primarily used his upper-90s fastball to keep the Marlins off-balance. He allowed one run and three hits while striking out six and walking one as 70 of his 106 pitches went for strikes.
Castillo also went 1 for 3 with an RBI and laid down a sacrifice bunt.
Iglesias relieved Castillo to start the ninth and allowed a three-run homer to Ozuna’s 24th homer to make it 6-4. Iglesias retired the next two batters to end the game with Stanton in the on-deck circle.
Straily, who went 14-8 in his only season with the Reds last year, allowed two runs and seven hits in six innings. He struck out four and walked two.
Miami’s A.J. Ellis hit a double over the head of diving centre fielder Billy Hamilton to cut the deficit to 2-1 in the sixth.
The Marlins had an opportunity to tie the game with Christian Yelich at bat, but Yelich tipped a ball just in front of home plate and was immediately tagged out by catcher Barnhart, who threw down to third to get Ellis trying to advance to end the inning.
The Reds responded by breaking open the game with four runs in the seventh, pushing their lead to 6-1. Adam Duvall grounder into a fielder’s choice for a run, Jose Peraza drew a bases-loaded walk, and Barnhart delivered a two-run single up the middle.
The Reds opened the scoring in the second with a pair of runs keyed by four consecutive singles including run-scoring ones by Barnhart and Castillo.
The Marlins escaped a dangerous situation later in the second when the Reds loaded the bases for Joey Votto, who hit a foul pop-up that was dropped by shortstop Miguel Rojas with third baseman Derek Dietrich converging. However, Votto was unable to take advantage of the miscues, grounding out to end the inning.
RMarlins: RHP Jose Urena (9-4, 4.04) will take the mound on Monday to open a three-game series against the Washington Nationals, who will counter with LHP Gio Gonzalez (8-5, 2.81). Urena allowed five runs in five innings in his last start at Texas.",National Post,0
VP Pence Advises Students On “Leadership” And It’s – Something,"I don’t know if Vice President Pence was being sarcastic, or if he actually believes this. Either way – WOW.
The VP was speaking with students in Chicago, and the topic turned to how to be a “leader” like President Trump.
In what may be the greatest case of Stockholm Syndrome in our lifetime, Pence addressed these young minds.
During a speech at the National Student Leadership Conference, Pence said in order for a leader to be like the president, they must listen, be humble, have a character people respect, work to serve others and learn from other leaders.
He was talking about Donald Trump, here. I just want to make sure everyone is perfectly clear on this.
“I truly believe that to reflect humility is to approach leadership every day as a learner and as a listener,” Pence told the students, according to a White House transcript of his speech.
Pence pointed to a meeting during Trump’s transition into office, when the president-elect “listened intently” and probed “virtually all of the high-tech entrepreneurs and executives in America.”
And then he runs off and does whatever he wants, or finds some way to tweet himself into total chaos.
“I urge you to be servant leaders, driven by a calling to support and to serve others — not by selfish ambition — as the animating force of your career,” he continued.
Pence also advised that they should “respect those who have been placed above you.”
“Honor them. Learn from them. Follow their example. Give them the honor that they are due,” he added.
Respect. I’m assuming he’s veered away from talking about Trump, at this point.
“Thanks to the leadership of President Trump, we are in the midst of a great national renewal. We are seeing the return of security and prosperity for our nation and our people,” Pence told the students.
Blink twice if you need someone to rescue you, Mr. Pence.
David Brooks Unaware His Own Snobbishness is the Barrier to Entry
He also said of future leaders they should, “practice discipline and to practice self-control” in order “to become the kind of woman and man that people will respect and people will follow.”
No. He’s no longer talking about Trump.
Some have noticed that Pence has done a lot of backing away from the latest Trump blowup, making sure others know he was not a part of the Trump campaign, at the time Trump Jr. was entertaining a Russian attorney at Trump Tower. Maybe he’s giving a sly nod to himself, instead.
Heads up, Pence. While you’re worlds better than Trump, people don’t tend to see milquetoasts as great leaders, either.",RedState,1

Bastille Day is a French national holiday that celebrates the Storming of the Bastille, that kickstarted the French Revolution.

NICE, France — As Hanane Charrihi's plane flew over the Promenade des Anglais in its final approach, the crowds that normally pack the seafront boulevard were replaced by an eerie line of white dots — hotel bed sheets covering the 86 victims of the 2016 Bastille Day truck rampage.
“My mother was there,” she recalled in Ma Mère Patrie(My Motherland), the book Charrihi wrote last year in tribute to her Moroccan immigrant mother Fatima, 62 — the first victim in a terror attack on this French Riviera resort. Charrihi had jumped on a plane from her home in Paris as soon as she heard about the massacre.
“Even if it was painful, I decided to visit the spot on the Promenade des Anglais a few days later,” she said.
To mark the anniversary of her mother's death, Charrihi on Friday is launching an association aimed at stopping the radicalization of young Muslims through education. “I want to work on prevention by telling my story in schools and prisons,” said Charrihi, 28.
“Many people who have been radicalized are completely disconnected from society,"" she added. ""I want to show to them there are young people who are desperate to go to school despite having no notebooks or shoes, while in France education is available to them for free.”
The terrorist responsible for the Nice attack was Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, 31, a French resident of Tunisian descent with a tumultuous personal life that involved petty crime, drug use and psychiatric problems. His turn to Islamic extremism had gone largely unnoticed by his family, friends or authorities.

Researchers say that's not unusual. “Many Muslims who get radicalized have a background of petty crime,"" said sociologist Tarik Yildiz, author of Qui Sont-Ils?(Who Are They?), a book that explores how young Muslims approach their faith and their life in France.
“They aren’t particularly religious or don’t even speak Arabic during their adolescence — until they discover certain aspects of religion that give them the points of reference the government, the school or their family haven’t been able to provide,” he added.
Nice is one of the French cities that have seen the most Muslims become radicalized: More than 100 from the region left to fight for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, according to municipal authorities. Charrihi said she was shocked to learn that barely two months after the terrorist attack that killed her mother, two teenage girls from Nice were arrested for planning a new attack.
“How do we explain that these kids, who have a whole life ahead of them, prefer to go to war instead of staying here,” Charrihi asked. “Do they have so little hope?""
After the Nice attack, Charrihi's family was called ""a band of terrorists"" and felt similar alienation and discrimination other young Muslims faced in France, she said. She added that Muslims fear future extremist attacks, too. One-third of the victims of the 2016 rampage were Muslims.

Terrorism has become part of France's new reality: The country has witnessed 13 terrorist attacks since January 2015.
It's also a new normal for the Muslim community in Nice, in the city's Quartier Notre-Dame, where Islamic bookshops, a mosque, halal food shops and cafes line Rue d’Italie and its neighboring streets.
Bastille Day in Nice, France: More anguish than celebration
Trump: 'Something could happen' on Paris climate agreement
Nice has come together as it prepares to pay homage to the victims and the survivors in somber ceremonies on Bastille Day, France's equivalent to July Fourth in the U.S.
Charrihi said that's a lesson for the country.
“I don’t feel incompatible with the French Republic, I am French and Muslim. I am French and I wear a hijab (headscarf),"" she wrote in her book. ""These are not irreconcilable.”

Exorcising the ‘Popular Will’: How Venezuela can reclaim its democracy,"Haneul Na'avi2 hours agoJune 27, 2017 99
Venezuela's political crisis is rooted in the conciliatory policies its socialist reformist government has followed towards its utterly implacable opponents.
“What we have to deal with here is a communist society [which] is thus in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it comes.” —Karl Marx, “Critique of the Gotha Programme”
The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela will cast votes on 30 July to determine its fate as President and United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) leader Nicolás Maduro continues to battle neoliberal opposition party Popular Will (VP), who has received Washington’s blessings.
Since 19 April, spontaneous “uprisings” have erupted in affluent barrios of Caracas, Venezuela’s capital, and Socopó, a small town strategically located in Barinas, where protesters have cut off food and medical supplies, killed over 80 people, and injured hundreds more.
Historically, Venezuelans are no stranger to US-orchestrated coups, which began during the Bush Administration’s 2002 putsch against PSUV founder and former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, and subsequent riots in 2014; many carried out by senior officials in the US government.
“[The] crucial figure around the coup was [Elliot] Abrams, [the] senior director of the National Security Council for ‘democracy, human rights and international operations’” and “has a conviction for misleading Congress over the infamous Iran-Contra affair,” the Guardian highlights.
US congressmen have also drafted a bill (S.1018) that “would allocate £7.8m for the Department of State and USAid to provide ‘humanitarian assistance’ — code for funding rightwing activities”, the Morning Star highlighted.
“If this Bill is approved, the Caribbean region would also come under renewed lobbying by the US government to strengthen its ‘energy security initiative’ (CESI) project — a move designed to undermine Venezuela’s support in the region and opening up new markets for the US”, it continued.
Fortunately, the US failed to coerce the Organisation for American States (OAS) to approve a resolution condemning Venezuela’s election during their 20 June meeting in Cancun, Mexico.
“Mexico’s position on Venezuela is a position that will not waver […] representative democracy is the only form of government acceptable in the Western Hemisphere,” Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray exclaimed, remaining completely mum on the 129 Azinoyapa students found dead in over 60 mass graves throughout Iguala several years ago.
Videgaray was not convincing enough to secure a majority vote, Venezuela Analysis noted:
“[It] secured the support of 20 OAS member states, falling short of the required two thirds majority by three votes [where] Bolivia, Nicaragua and a handful of small Caribbean states outright rejected the proposal, while Grenada, Trinidad and Tobago, Antigua and Barbuda, the Dominican Republic and others abstained.”
After lambasting Videgaray, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez reminded him of Venezuela’s departure from the OAS, “which […] began on April 27 [and] will continue since it takes two years for a country to withdraw from the organization,” CaribFlame reported.
Venezuela’s election would secure popularly appointed representatives for a Constituent National Assembly to replace the current parliament now controlled by opposition parties.
It would organise 540 constituent parliamentarians, with 346 from all territorial municipalities and 186 MPs from seven key sectors, into communes, TeleSUR notes.
constitutionnet.org elucidates the reasons for these reforms:
One of [Chavez’s] 1998 campaign promises was that he would [organise] a referendum asking the Venezuelan people if they wish to convene a National Constituent Assembly [in order to] to open up political discourse to independent and third parties by changing the national political process and eliminating political corruption of the past.
However, what Venezuelans need is less, not more dialogue with the opposition, if any at all.
Material Reasons for the US-led Coup
When analysing US imperialism, one must consider that American invests in ‘liberal democracy’ and ‘human rights’ for purely materialistic (resource-based) and geopolitical reasons.
As noted in previous Duran articles, the Trump Doctrine prioritises its economic policy, which combines the vast privatisation of public infrastructure with control of the petrodollar by opening domestic oil production and consumption—both to stave off an economic collapse.
They also criticise the failures of both the Peronist Argentinian government under Christina Fernandez Kirchner and Brazilian Worker’s Party (PT) with Dilma Rousseff, as they were both overthrown by US-led political coups; the very same that Venezuela faces today.
Maduro’s snap elections have not provoked the US; this is a superstructural casus belli. Rather, the PSUV has been moving away from Western financial institutions, selling off USD, nationalising capital, and forming solid partnerships with Iran, China, Russia, and others.
A month before the protests began, The World Bank International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) ruled in Venezuela’s favour after Chavez nationalised the Cero Negro and La Ceiba ExxonMobil refineries in mid-2000 “as part of a strategy to redirect the profits away from Venezuela’s mineral resources, telecoms, and agriculture industries and toward social programs”.
“[…] even at $1.6 billion, the compensation was substantially lower than what Exxon had asked for: $14.7 billion,” Oilprice insinuates. The US—mainly US Secretary of State (and former ExxonMobil CEO) Rex Tillerson—was left fuming by the ruling.
In May 2007, the PSUV government also parted with the IMF and World Bank after paying off all its outstanding debts, in response to the 2002 US-backed coup.
“Venezuela recently repaid its debts to the World Bank five years ahead of schedule. In doing so it saved $8m (£3.99m) and cleared all its debts to the IMF shortly after Mr Chávez was elected,” the Guardian noted.
The gesture empowered Venezuela to seek new fiscal ventures following a period of “high public spending and private consumption, fuelled by high oil prices and historically low interest rates.”
The following December, Chavez inaugurated plans with six South American presidents to create the Bank of the South (BancoSUR), the central bank of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) and a rival institution to its former creditors.
“The bank is a political fact and is part of an economic war that is also social and ideological,” Chavez mentioned.
A 2015 Council on Hemispheric Affairs (COHA) article specifies the bank’s nature:
The bank will have an authorized capital of $20 billion USD, with 20,000 trade shares, each with a par value of $1 million USD [and whilst] only UNASUR member states may hold the main shares, every state in the world may be a purchaser of secondary shares.
“Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela will provide 20 percent of the subscribed capital one year after the agreement [and become] endorsed for $7 billion USD shares,” it explained.
These three nations are the largest shareholders of the bank and, subsequently, became targets of former US President and counterintelligence laureate Barack Obama. US President Donald Trump continued these attacks by picking Rex Tillerson over Elliot Abrams, as Tillerson’s oil market experience took precedence following the 2015 Saudi oil glut.
As a result, Venezuela has been left at the helm of Bolivarian regional integration with only its secondary shareholders remaining, and was also forced to prioritise UNASUR after its primary shareholders became US vassals and suspended the country’s participation in Mercosur.
However, BancoSUR has yet to find suitable replacements for the gap in primary shareholder capital, and to further expedite regionalisation, needs to fully implement the Regional Compensation Unique System (SUCRE) for Bolivarian Alliance for the People of our Americas (ALBA) members.
The SUCRE, a virtual currency, would help avoid “the dollarization of Latin American economies [and] the ebb and flow of foreign capital that causes economic bubbles [and] volatility,” and move “towards a more decisive monetary edifice [for] regional trade requirements,” COHA explained.
However, corruption within Ecuador and Venezuela emerged after white collar criminals used it to launder money via “ghost companies”, where they “over-invoiced for goods received and took advantage of favourable exchange rates” and, by 2014, “up to 5% of Sucre transactions were suspicious in nature,” prompting a thorough joint investigation, FINTRAIL highlighted.
The Saudi oil glut ravaged global oil markets and Venezuela’s petrol revenues, prompting Maduro to discuss matters with Russia, Iran and other Persian Gulf states to stabilise production.
Obama first exploited Venezuela’s fiscal problems by imposing unilateral sanctions, and later, Trump hastily targeted the PDVSA, ultimately damaging American markets as well.
“Some 95 percent of its foreign incomes results from the export of crude oil with 40 percent of sales coming from the United States,” Deutsche Welle reports.
Luckily, banning PDVSA crude will, in the long term, force Venezuela to diversify clientele; something Russia and Iran are wholly familiar with. Obviously, the best way to achieve this is via the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB); however, Venezuela requires something more.
Resolving the Crisis of Bolivarian Socialism
Latin American socialism is dying because of its social-democratic nature. Its leaders have prioritised Bolivarian ‘regional integration’ over all other necessities, foregoing a dictatorship of the proletariat (DotP), which has allowed reactionary forces to flourish with impunity.
Consequently, the Latin American bourgeoisie are more aptly trained in the ‘international, violent character’ of revolution than their hosts, and Venezuela is no exception.
For these reasons, VP spokespersons Henrique Capriles and Leopold Lopez openly command Venezuela’s far-right, “[asking] his supporters to keep up the almost daily street mobilizations.”
US-backed death squads can murder innocent Venezuelans, attack supply routes, and enjoy the good graces of the US State Department and its invasive, lickspittle press with few consequences.
The opposition claims that Maduro does not respect ‘constitutional democracy’; yet, Venezuela’s constitution needs to be rewritten, as it is the very obstacle hindering the security of the country.
Constitutional democracy has permitted neoliberal MPs 167 seats in parliament and the Supreme Court to reverse Maduro’s transfer of powers from the National Assembly to the judiciary branch, with spectators clasping hands and rejoicing, “the people have spoken!”
Had the PSUV been more Bolshevik and less Narodnik in its views, it could have achieved the same level of success as its ALBA comrades in Cuba, whose only concession to the bourgeoisie was providing transport for a permanent settlement in Little Havana.
Instead of following Cuba’s example, the PSUV have instead relied on economism, regionalism, and legalism to secure its revolutions. What it has failed to do is utilise the entire state apparatus to eliminate class divisions and wither away the state.
A furious Karl Marx addressed a similar leader, Gottfried Ludolf Camphausen, in the Neue Rheinsiche Zeitung with his essay, “The Bourgeoisie and the Counter-Revolution”.
Hal Draper invokes Marx’s definition of a ‘proper’ dictatorship:
Every provisional state setup after a revolution requires a dictatorship [and] taxed Camphausen […] with not immediately smashing and eliminating the remnants of the old institutions.
Lenin elaborates this in precise detail in State and Revolution:
Only in communist society, when the resistance of the capitalists have disappeared, when there are no classes […] only then “the state… ceases to exist”, […] only then will democracy begin to wither away, owing to the simple fact that, freed from capitalist slavery, from the untold horrors, savagery, absurdities, and infamies of capitalist exploitation, people will gradually become accustomed to observing the elementary rules of social intercourse […] without coercion, without subordination, without the special apparatus for coercion called the state.
This is precisely what Latin America, save for Cuba, has failed to do. They call themselves “socialists” without following socialism’s basic tenants—smashing the state as prescribed by Marx.
Following the 26 July revolution, Republic of Cuba founders Fidel and Raul Castro expropriated the bourgeoisie, nationalised foreign capital, and abolished private property without hesitation.
Venezuela must act just as decisively after the 30 July elections.
Once (if!) the new Constituency Assembly convenes, the government should propose the following resolutions via popular vote, executive orders, and intergovernmental dialogue:
* Initiate military campaign to root out Popular Will collaborators and saboteurs. Establish a humanitarian corridor and provide timely updates to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).
* Negotiate with the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to denominate national oil in alternative currencies. Float SUCRE on Yuan or Euros.
* Work with global partnerships throughout AIIB to oversee construction of refineries, pipelines, and infrastructure. Offer oil security and secondary shares to collaborators in return. Renegotiate relationship to private sector.
Venezuelans must restore democracy after 30 July. No longer can neoliberal elements lie in wait like a chronic illness amongst the people. Maduro must take the steps to learn from the mistakes of Brazil and Argentina, as well as follow Cuba’s example, in order to become a true socialist state.
For the sake of its bright future, it must take action, and whilst its task is daunting, it can prevail.",The Duran,1
WATCH: “Patriotic” Rand Paul Defends Trump’s Use of Foreign Labor with Lame Free Market Defense,"July 23, 2017Suman Sridhar Politics
One of Trump’s biggest campaign promises during the Republican Primary and general election was to fight globalization through American exceptionalism. The slogan “Make America Great Again” was not just a catchy, patriotic phrase: it was a call to return the country to a time when it was the manufacturing giant in the world, alongside implementing some subtle bigoted connotations that would appeal to white working class.
Trump outlined his plan to do this through several actions: discard the Transpacific Partnership, a global trade plan that gives multinational corporations more power over workers; start a trade war with China, and give incentives to companies that stayed in the US. The irony to all of this, of course, was the fact that Trump was a hypocrite. Several of his materials were noted to be manufactured in China, while his company hired foreign workers over American ones.
Being the con man that he was, though, Trump managed to hide all of this from his support base and get elected to the Oval Office. Since then, the President has failed to increase tariffs against China, keep jobs from getting outsourced, and even promoted outsourcing through his daughter Ivanka’s line of shoes. And while he did get rid of TPP, his administration’s new version of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) bears a close resemblance to it.
During an interview with Jake Tapper, Trump attempted to defend his lack of progress on this issue by blaming China’s market manipulation. While this does actually have a grain of truth, it was Rand Paul’s follow-up defense that proved that the Republican Party’s unethical support of Trump was far from ending. Speaking also to Tapper, Paul claimed, in typical libertarian words, that Trump’s hypocrisy was justified because it is cheaper for the average American to purchase foreign-made goods.
As anyone with even a basic understanding of global economics can retort, though, that is because material items from third-world countries are manufactured in sweat shops, which see employees get terrible wages. Companies based in the US, as a result of decades of work from labor unions, are required to follow standards such no child labor and a minimum wage.
Tapper countered this by pointing out that Trump’s use of foreign labor for his own places did not help the working class because of the expensive entrance fees. Caught in a corner, Paul was forced to resort to typical right-wing talking points about evil regulations and high corporate taxes. Check out the exchange below:

New Seth Rich Murder Theory Blames ‘Hired Killer Or Serial Murderer’ For DNC Staffer’s Death,"A new report funded by a Republican lobbyist alleges Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was most likely killed by either “a hired killer or serial murderer.”
That conclusion runs contrary to the police verdict that Rich, killed in Washington, D.C., in July 2016, was the victim of a robbery gone bad. Some theories to explain his death have suggested Rich was linked to the hacking of the DNC that occurred in 2016. No proof has been found to support that theory.
The new information was developed through the efforts of the Profiling Project, a group of George Washington University graduate students studying forensic psychology. Political consultant Jack Burkman, who has offered a reward for solving Rich’s murder, supported the group’s work.
The Profiling Project report released Tuesday claims that “Seth’s death does not appear to be a random homicide” or a “robbery gone bad,” though it provides no evidence that the killer was hired by someone.
“The person folks (should be) looking for and considering isn’t a robber who kills, but really is a killer, and maybe a killer that doesn’t rob,” said Kevin Doherty, who worked on the Profiling Project. “The fact that this person has gotten away with it shows a level of proficiency.”
“The crime scene was sanitized, there is no direct linking to really anything. The police have no suspects,” he said.
“The individuals have gotten away with it at this point in time. There were no behavioral indications at the crime scene. It didn’t look like rage or revenge or hate were the motivation behind it. It’s really a lack of behavioral indicators, motion and evidence that leads us to believe that whoever did this is proficient at killing,” he said.
The group’s report — based on nothing more than information available to the general public — states that “the crime scene was very organized to the point of being sanitized. This would indicate careful planning on the part of the offender, control of the entry to and exit from the crime scene as well as in-depth understanding of law-enforcement investigative processes.”
Further, “if offender actively managed the crime scene, intentionally leaving no evidence or insight, offender may be an experienced, sophisticated criminal with in-depth knowledge of law-enforcement procedures.”
“We do not believe offender is a robber, nor a robber who killed. Offender had the ability to kill, and brought with them an instrument to do so. Though we do not know what other items Seth may have had in his possession, his watch, phone and necklace were not stolen.”
The report said that Rich “was reported to have (been) awake, talking to responding officers and unaware he was shot.” From that, the students concluded, “there was no face-to-face interaction between Seth and offender.”
Rich’s family downplayed the report.
“As noted, by the report’s own methodology, ‘The profiling project was given no special access to any materials, evidence or persons and due to case sensitivity, conducted only informal, limited interview,’” the family statement said.
“Given that fact, the family hopes that the general public takes the findings at face value: valuable experience in research collection and report writing for students at George Washington University but in no way should take any findings contained within as new, credible or otherwise lending credence to conspiracy theories surrounding the circumstances of Seth’s death.”
Doherty said the Profiling Project is not finished.
“We’re personally tied to this,” he said. “This is a case that we want to solve. We want to provide closure on this.”",WesternJournalism,1
HOWARD DEAN: Losing 4 Special Elections Isn’t a ‘Bad Sign’ for Democrats (VIDEO),"The former chair for the Democratic National Committee, Howard Dean, showed his eternal optimism recently by saying that the fact that Democrats have lost all the special election isn’t a bad sign for the Democrats.
The Washington Free Beacon reported:
MSNBC host Katy Tur pointed out that Democrats have not won a special congressional election over Republicans this year, and asked Dean whether they should be focusing on policy agenda ideas and trying to fix Obamacare.
“I don’t think the special elections are a bad sign,” Dean said. “Here we take four very Republican districts and come within four or six points of all of the seats where we were behind 20 in the last election, so I’m not concerned about that.”
“I think the special elections have actually worked well for us, proving we can in fact win in red districts, but just not quite as red as the ones we’ve been in,” Dean added.
Dean’s diagnosis of the Democrats losing the special elections is similar to that of Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez, who tried to downplay the losses because they were Republican districts.
“I know folks were a little disappointed earlier this week. There were some elections in Georgia and South Carolina that we didn’t quite get to the finish line on, but you know what folks? Those are beet red districts,” Perez said last week at the Texas AFL-CIO Convention in Houston.
Despite Dean and Perez’s optimism, there are several Democrats who believe the party does not have a winning strategy and that they need a revival.
Let’s hope that the Democrats continue to believe this!

"WATCH: Feral Thug Tries To Kill 2 Indiana Cops With His Car, Gets Instant Justice Instead","Charles K. Dinkins (left) tried to run cops over with his vehicle (right)
A feral thug from Indiana recently tried to run two police officers over with his vehicle in an attempt to kill them. Now, the shocking footage from one cop’s body camera is going viral as the thug receives the brutal dose of instant justice that he deserved for trying to assault a couple of Indiana’s finest.
Charles K. Dinkins, 48, was getting pulled over by police at 2:30 am when he fled and crashed through a gate to avoid arrest. He proceeded to drive around a U.S. post office, crashing into two separate vehicles. This is when things went from bad to worse for the stupid criminal as police capitalized on their opportunity to serve him true justice.
In the body camera video, Officers Sean Dennis and Jonathan Thornton exit the patrol car and order a woman kneeling on the ground to show her hands as she wails, “I jumped out of the car,” according to Daily Mail.
Once the women fled from the car and the officers exited their cars as well, fear kicked in, according to the officers. Dinkins saw his opportunity to run down the police, and he took it. He went all in, attempting to run them over with his vehicle, but these cops knew it was coming. The officers told reporters this is when they felt the most threatened.
The terrified officers are heard in a video, yelling for the car to be stopped. “Stop the car! Stop the car!” they shouted. Seconds later, the officer yells, “Shots fired!” and he runs between parked cars in the post office parking lot. The two cops draw their guns and fired eighteen rounds at Dinkins’ Chevrolet Cavalier as it screeched past them.
Both cops proceeded to chase Dinkins’ car on foot as he sped past them eventually leaving the post office parking lot. It was confirmed Dinkins was hit by one bullet which allegedly caused him to hit another parked car on an adjacent street. More shots were fired when Dinkins drove near the officers again, then Dinkins left the lot through a hole he had created in the fence.
Dinkins’ is being charged with aggravated battery. He will appear in court and be sentenced by Delaware Circuit Court Judge Marianne Vorhees on August 23, 2017. The most serious charge, attempted aggravated battery, is a Level 3 felony, carrying up to 16 years in prison, according to the report by the Indy Star.
Neither cop was injured in the pursuit, but they both testified that they feared for their lives. The deputy prosecutor said he was scared watching the video the first time, adding that he feared the officers would be injured, the Indy Star reported. The investigation confirmed that state police found no charges would be filed against the Indiana police for using their guns.
The body cams are the best thing that could have happened to the police community. Now, criminals like Dinkins can’t lie their way out of their crimes. These cops feared for their lives as they were being chased by a psycho criminal. The cops were almost killed by this feral thug, but thanks to their training and quick thinking, they were able to not only deliver some instant just but also put this criminal away while doing one of America’s most dangerous jobs.

6 Americans who should be investigated for their Ukrainian ties,"Adam Garrie4 hours agoJuly 15, 2017 99
UKROGATE is the real foreign meddling scandal in the 2016 US Presidential election. These are just some of the people who should be thoroughly investigated for their ties to Kiev.
Incoming FBI Director Cristopher Wray has stated that he would be interested in investigating links between officials of the Ukrainian regime and the Hillary Clinton campaign.
With evidence mounting that high level officials in Kiev actively worked with the Clinton campaign to try and influence US voters, it is imperative that any future investigation isn’t whitewashed simply because Kiev’s tactics failed to win the election for Clinton.
Although the investigation into Donald Trump’s non-existent links with Russia have unsurprisingly come up with virtually nothing of interest, the methods of the investigation ought to be examined and replicated where necessary in a future Ukraine-Clinton investigation.
One of the most fascinating aspects of the so-called Russiagate investigation is that seemingly anyone connected to Donald Trump who ever had a conversation with a Russian, irrespective of their lack of involvement in Russian politics, is a person of interest to investigators.
The same tactics could be accurately applied to an investigation into Clinton and the Democratic party’s links with Ukraine.
Here are the people that ought to be questioned.
Hunter Biden is the youngest son of Barack Obama’s Vice President Joe Biden. In April of 2014, just two months after the February coup in Kiev, Joe Biden visited Ukraine where he gave a tub-thumping speech about the need for the Ukrainian regime to rely less on Russian gas supplies.
Weeks later, Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of directors of Ukraine’s largest private sector gas company, Burisma.
While many spoke of a prima facie conflict of interest in the appointment, the US mainstream media’s favourable stance towards the Obama administration meant that the story never saw the light of day.
The issue remains prescient, especially in light of allegations regarding wide spread Ukrainian collusion with the Democratic party in respect of the 2016 election.
The timing of Joe Biden’s anti-Russian Ukrainian gas speech and his son’s appointment to the board of a major Ukrainian energy company necessarily means that the former American Vice President is a person of interest.
No one could reasonably believe that the proximate timing of the former VP’s speech and his son’s appointment to the board of Burisma was coincidental.
This is a matter which speaks of itself.
For over 10 years, Chalupa, a US citizen of Ukrainian origin worked for the Democratic party. It has been established that she had multiple meetings at the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington D.C. in order to dig up dirt on former Trump campaign worker Paul Manafort.
Chalupa claims that her visits to the Ukrainian Embassy were for unrelated endeavours. Her word should not be take at face value. Her interactions with foreign officials in relation to the 2016 US election should be fully investigated.
Unlike Chalupa, McCain is not a Democrat, McCain has more political ties to Ukraine than anyone in the US Senate. His position as a former Presidential candidate and a strong critic of Donald Trump makes him a person of interest.
McCain is something of a fanatic when it comes to the Ukraine issue. Prior to the coup of February 2014, McCain was frequently pictured in Kiev with many extremist and fascist leaders who actively participated in the coup.
McCain recently visited Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko along with troops loyal to the regime during the 2016/2017 New Year’s holiday.
This visit, just weeks before Donald Trump’s inauguration ought to be thoroughly investigated as well as McCain’s other connections to a plethora of Ukrainian politicians, leaders, business and military figures.
For these reasons and because of McCain’s increasingly dubious role in allegedly leaking the so-called ‘Urinegate’ dossier to the media, he is clearly a person of interest.
Maxine Waters is a Democratic Congresswoman from Los Angeles whose anti-Russian rhetoric is vile and at times incoherent, but nevertheless protected by free speech.
It is not clear if Waters has any direct connections with Ukrainian authorities, but an innocent prank call by the Russian comic callers Vovan and Lexus to Waters, reveals that she is highly susceptible to anti-Russian propaganda. The fact she engaged with the prank callers, seemingly believing that they were officials from Kiev, means that Waters ought to be questioned about any real calls she may have taken from actual Ukrainian regime officials.
For those who believe that Waters is far removed from the sandal, one ought to be reminded that political commentator Alex Jones has been accused by Hillary Clinton of being a Russian agent. It was later confirmed by Jones and other media outlets that the FBI is currently investigating whether Jones’s platform InfoWars as well as Breitbart had direct links with Russia.
InfoWars and Breitbart can hardly be considered Russophile outlets, but the fact remains that Waters has said far more in favour of Ukraine than InfoWars or Breitbart have of Russia.
What’s good for the goose is good for a much more prominent gander.
Lindsey Graham was a Trump opponent before it became fashionable in certain quarters. During the Republican primary, Donald Trump read out Graham’s private phone number and encouraged his supporters to ring up the Senator.
Graham was furious with Trump and later had to change his phone number.
When it comes to being a US Senator with close ties to the Ukrainian regime, only John McCain has more than Graham. Graham indeed accompanied McCain to Ukraine on his infamous New Year’s excursion and has close personal contacts with many individuals in Kiev.
For the same reasons McCain should be of interest to anyone who wants to unearth the extent of Ukrainian interference in American democracy, Graham ought to be on the list too.",The Duran,1
ERDOGAN: Turkey will fight against Kurdish state without consulting any other country,"Adam Garrie10 mins agoJune 24, 2017 99
This is Erdogan's strongest warning to the US about its pro-Kurdish policies to-date.
Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has made his most unambiguous statement to date on how far Turkey would go in opposing the creation of a Kurdish state on Syrian territory.
Erdogan then issued a thinly veiled warning at the United States which has strongly allied with Turkey’s Kurdish enemies in Syria.
“In case of even the slightest threat against our country, we will do what’s necessary without consulting anyone”.
“Nowadays, there is some negative progress in Syria. If that would cause any threat to our borders, the world should know that we would react the same as we did in Operation Euphrates Shield”.
The clear meaning here is that if the US supports the creation of a Kurdish state on Syrian territory adjacent to Turkey, Erdogan will act without consulting the United States in spite of being a NATO member.
Turkey sees the creation of any Kurdish state on its borders as a manifest threat to Turkey’s security. This is not a policy unique to Erdogan. Any Turkish leader would feel the same. This more or less destroys the principles of the NATO charter that says an attack on a NATO member state must be regarded as an attack on all NATO states. With Turkey and the US totally at odds over the Kurdish question, the idea that NATO can truly function as a collective security unit is now myth that has been fully shattered.
What’s even more worrying is how little the United States seems to care about alienating a long-term ally which is now in an increasingly adversarial position vis-a-vis the United States.",The Duran,1

President Trump hates America's trade deals. But he hasn't said what better deals would look like, or how he'll bring jobs back from Mexico.
That should change on Monday. Trump's U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, is expected to publish a list of goals for the upcoming renegotiation of NAFTA, the free trade agreement among Canada, Mexico and the United States.
Trump made NAFTA his No. 1 trade target during his campaign for the White House.
""NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country,"" he said during the first presidential debate in September.
The president blames NAFTA for the loss of millions of jobs to Mexico, even though nonpartisan congressional research found that NAFTA had only a modest impact on the U.S. economy and didn't cause an exodus of jobs.
Still, Trump credits the criticism of NAFTA in part for his victory, and renegotiating it is central to his pledge to bring jobs back.
About 14 million U.S. jobs depend on trade with Canada and Mexico, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. More than $1 billion in commerce crosses the southern and northern borders of the United States every day.
So a lot is on the line, and businesses in each country worry that Trump will impose tariffs or withdraw from the deal altogether if the talks go south. That could lead to a trade war.
Here's what to watch for when the Trump administration releases its NAFTA wish list.
1. Bring back manufacturing jobs
Trump and his team have said they want to create jobs in the United States by changing a key provision in NAFTA called rules of origin.
For any manufactured product sold in the three countries, the rules say a certain percentage of the parts must come from those three countries. For example, for any car sold in North America, 62.5% of the parts have to come from Canada, the United States or Mexico.
Some trade experts believe Trump wants to raise that percentage to force car companies to use more parts from the United States. While that could generate jobs, experts say, it could raise car prices, too.
2. Close the U.S.-Mexico trade deficit
During the campaign, Trump often cited the U.S. trade deficit -- $63 billion last year -- and framed it as an indication of lost jobs and lost money.
Experts believe Trump may seek a clause in a new NAFTA that would require Mexico to balance the deficit, or at least bring the $63 billion closer to $0.
Many economists say Trump's fixation on the trade deficit is misguided. A trade deficit with Mexico means American businesses and individuals bought more goods and services from Mexico than Mexicans bought from the United States. Deficits are no indication of lost jobs, companies or money.
Trump quickly fulfilled a campaign promise in January when he pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, another big regional trade agreement. The Obama administration had helped lead the talks for TPP.
Trump's trade team says the principles of TPP could be revived in a new NAFTA. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross called certain aspects of TPP ""the starting point"" for a new deal with Canada and Mexico, though he didn't specify which ones.
TPP included provisions to enforce higher labor standards, better environmental rules and tighter protections around intellectual property rights. Those could be woven into NAFTA.
4. The Amazon clause
NAFTA went into effect in 1994 -- before cell phones, WiFi and Snapchat. There's nothing in NAFTA about e-commerce.
As technology has evolved -- and as shopping in all countries moves online -- businesses like Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) and eBay (EBAY) have been left outside the NAFTA rulebook.
A new NAFTA could lower the trade barriers for those companies and bring them more business. For example, it could reduce the taxes that Mexican shoppers pay for buying from Amazon.

ELECTION FALLOUT: Texas County Votes To Return To Paper Ballots,"After years of reports of electronic voting machines “accidentally” registering votes for Republicans as votes for Democrats, one Texas county has had enough of the uncertainty and has voted to return to paper ballots.
Denton County experienced a series of issues during last year’s presidential election, and its voters aren’t taking any chances.
The Texas Tribune reports:
Denton has been using a hybrid voting system that employs both electronic and paper ballots for about a decade. But county officials recently approved spending just shy of $9 million to buy new voting equipment from Austin-based Hart InterCivic that will return to an entirely paper-based system in time for this year’s November elections. Even disabled voters, who will cast their votes on touch-screen machines, will have their ballots printed out and tallied through a print scanner.
The move comes months after a disastrous election day for Denton County in November, with machines inadvertently set to “test mode” instead of “election mode,” long lines, problems with scanning paper ballots, and, ultimately, incorrect tabulations. Phillips — who was working in nearby Tarrant County at the time — said it was the personnel, not the machines, that caused chaos last fall. But voters in town, as well as leaders with the local Democratic and Republican parties, called for a return to paper ballots in the months following election day.
“The question always comes: ‘How do I know that when I cast my ballot it’s recorded electronically?’” Phillips said. “We know it’s recorded correctly because of our testing methods, but that question has persisted ever since we started using electronic voting. With the political climate these days, it’s even more heightened right now.”
Sometimes progress isn’t progress.

"Tillerson Wants Fewer U.S. Diplomats, Fewer Meetings at U.N. Summit","The State Department plans to scale back its diplomatic presence at this year’s annual U.N. gathering of world leaders in September, a cost-saving initiative that delivers another powerful signal that America is deepening its retreat from international diplomacy, according to four well-placed diplomatic sources.
For more than seven decades, American presidents from Harry Truman to Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama have attended the fall U.N. General Assembly general debate in New York to project their vision of American foreign policy to the world. They have been accompanied by a growing entourage of American diplomats, lawyers and technical experts who negotiate a wide range of issues, from nuclear arms treaties to climate change pacts and conflicts.
President Donald Trump does plan to address other world leaders at the U.N, General Assembly, and he will be accompanied by other top advisors, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his daughter Ivanka Trump, who stopped by U.N. headquarters Friday for a private lunch with U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres.
But the ranks of professional diplomats, aides and officials that attend the event to promote American policy priorities on a range of issues will be thinned out. For now, it remains unclear precisely how large of a cut in U.S. staff is envisioned, but two officials said that the State Department is seeking to keep a ceiling down to about 300 people, including everyone from the President to support staff that schedule meetings and copy speeches back at the hotel.
Last year, 347 U.S. officials were counted by the U.N. in the official American delegation, which included then President Obama and his top diplomat, John Kerry. But the full delegation, including support staff and security, was far larger, according to former U.S. officials.
The State Department and the National Security Council had not responded to a request for comment. A spokesman for the U.S. mission to the United Nations declined to comment.
While some critics fear that a truncated diplomatic presence will diminish U.S. influence on an important international stage, others, including Trump supporters and former political appointees in the Obama administration, think the American delegation could use some trimming.
Richard Gowan, a U.N. expert at the European Council on  , said that a lighter presidential workload at the September summit might not be such a bad thing, particularly given Trump’s record of aggravating diplomatic disagreements with allies in recent foreign visits. But a larger diplomatic presence could help potentially diminish the damage.
“Trump demonstrated at the NATO and G20 meetings that he doesn’t really know how to behave on these occasions,” Gowan said. Tillerson and Haley “should be absolutely cocooning the president in staffers in the hope that they can keep him away from trouble.”
Despite the scaled-back expectations, President Trump is expected to stay in the area for longer than his predecessor, who generally spent two working days in New York. Obama and his aides used to stay a night at the Waldorf Astoria — at least until the purchase of the storied hotel by a Chinese insurance giant, Anbang Insurance Group. That prompted Obama and the American delegation to check out for good, fearing China might spy on them. They relocated to the New York Palace, which is owned by a South Korean conglomerate, Lotte Group.
Trump, who is expected to stay at his New Jersey golf club, had initially planned to spend ten days, receiving foreign leaders at his club. But sources said he is likely to cut back his visit to a few days.
Tillerson, meanwhile, is expected to spend far less time engaging in diplomatic spadework than his predecessors, who traditionally spend more than a week in New York meeting with foreign dignitaries in countless meetings.
The U.N. General Assembly debate opens this year on Tuesday Sept. 19 with an address by Trump, who will speak after the U.N. General Assembly President, the U.N. Secretary-General and the President of Brazil. While attention focuses on the speeches of kings, presidents and prime ministers, it also provides an opportunity for mid-level officials from the State Department and other federal agencies to participate in intensive rounds of speed diplomacy.
Most of the State Department bureaus key assistant secretaries generally bring along at least a dozen staffers. But this year they have been instructed to scale back, in some cases allowing only a single aide to accompany the acting chief of the the bureau on the trip.
The diplomatic culling is being enforced by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson — the former ExxonMobil chief who has shown little interest in U.N. diplomacy during his first six months on the job. It comes at a time when the White House is seeking as much as a 30 percent cut in U.S. funding to the State Department, and even deeper cuts in U.N. operations.
The international preparations have set the stage for clashes over a range of priorities. Earlier this month, Nikki Haley, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, proposed making the Syrian refugee crisis the centerpiece of the president’s debut before the world community.
Haley, who recently traveled to Jordan and Turkey to highlight the plight of Syrian refugees, has made the issue a signature priority during her tenure. Haley had already pressed the U.N. Secretary-General to participate in a high level meeting aimed to rally international assistance to those countries.
The plan–which resembles a strategy favored by Britain — would seek to create improved conditions for Syrian refugees in their region, reducing the need to resettle them in the West.
But the White House nixed the idea, which would have drawn attention to President Trump’s ban on travel for individuals from several Muslim countries wracked by conflict.
Instead, the White House identified five priorities it intends to highlight: reining in North Korea’s nuclear program, resolving the Syria crisis, rallying support for a tougher response to terrorism, reforming the United Nations, and addressing the refugee and hunger crisis.
While Syrian refugees will still be on the agenda, it will have to share stage time with a host of other humanitarian issues, including risks of famine in Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen. The famines have garnered increased interest in the White House since Ivanka Trump has taken a personal interest in addressing world hunger.
Trump will not attend any high-level meeting on refugees.
But the schedule remains in flux. White House planners are exploring the possibility of having the president attend a high-level meeting hosted by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres on famine. They are also considering having Trump appear at a side meeting on U.N. reform, which could include the U.S. push to reform the U.N. Human Rights Council.
Foreign delegations, however, say they remain in the dark about the American plans for UNGA. “I haven’t heard from the U.S. mission any plans to organize a big event where they would need other heads of state,” said one diplomat from a major country. “I haven’t heard anything.”",Foreign Policy,0

Man indicted in deaths of 9 people in 2 fires in Ohio,"July 27, 2017 1:04 PM
An Ohio man already charged in a blaze that killed seven people in May has been indicted on aggravated murder charges in that fire and in a second fire that killed two people on the same street last year.
Prosecutors say a grand jury on Thursday indicted 58-year-old Stanley Ford in the May 15 fire in Akron that killed seven people, including five children. He had pleaded not guilty to charges including aggravated murder after his arrest in that blaze and remains jailed on $7 million bond.
The grand jury on Thursday also indicted the Akron man on new charges in an April 2016 fire that killed 66-year-old Lindell Lewis and 65-year-old Gloria Hart and in a January vehicle fire with no injuries.

The World’s Shift to Electric Cars,"Exclusive: Despite resistance from the oil industry and Team Trump, the transition to electric vehicles is accelerating, with key foreign countries and some U.S. states taking the lead, writes Jonathan Marshall.
Even as the Trump administration scrubs federal web sites of data about climate science and clean energy and appoints coal industry lobbyists to senior policy positions, other nations are responding vigorously to the reality of global warming.
The Nissan Leaf, an electric car at a charging station.
Great Britain and France have recently announced ambitious timetables for phasing out fossil-fueled cars by 2040. Even bolder are Norway, which expects all new cars sold by 2025 to be electric, up from 37 percent today, and India, which set 2030 as its target date for going all-electric.
Together with the rising domestic popularity of all-electric and hybrid electric vehicles, the potential political contagion from such foreign programs is spurring major U.S. fossil fuel producers into spending millions of dollars to kill clean transportation alternatives.
A shadowy outfit called Fueling U.S. Forward, devoted to promoting greater use of oil and natural gas, recently produced a misleading attack video called “Dirty Secrets of Electric Cars.” The New York Times exposed the group as “a public relations group for fossil fuels funded by Koch Industries, the oil and petrochemicals conglomerate led by the ultraconservative billionaire brothers David H. and Charles G. Koch.”
The stakes, both financial and environmental, are high. The U.S. transportation sector currently consumes 14 million barrels of petroleum products every day. Transitioning away from all that gasoline and diesel to cleaner electric transportation will be critical to lowering carbon emissions before global warming wreaks havoc on human civilization and natural ecosystems. It will also help alleviate vehicle air pollution that kills an estimated 50,000 people each year in the United States alone.
Unlike the power sector, where the renewable energy revolution is well underway across the nation, transportation remains largely stuck in the last century. In my car-friendly state of California, for example, thanks to a boom in solar and wind energy, electric power today accounts for only about 20 percent of statewide greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation, by contrast, contributes 36 percent, far more than any other sector.
When charged by clean solar, wind, hydro or nuclear power, electric cars and trucks contribute almost no greenhouse or toxic air emissions. Even in states with a high proportion of coal-fired generation, efficient electric vehicles (EVs) account for fewer emissions than the average new gas-powered car.
With coal-burning plants increasingly giving way to cleaner natural gas-fired plants and renewable generation of energy, more than 70 percent of Americans now live in areas where EVs cause fewer emissions even than the cleanest conventional cars, according to recent research by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). On average, across the country, EVs create as little carbon pollution as gasoline-powered cars that get 73 mpg — if such cars even existed.
Critics, like the Koch-funded Fueling U.S. Forward, complain that it takes more energy to manufacture an electric car than a gas-powered car, mostly because of the need for big batteries. But those manufacturing emissions are more than offset by the reduced emissions from driving a mid-sized electric car after just 5,000 miles, the UCS report notes.
Electric Vehicles on a Roll
Electric vehicles today number only about 2 million, or just 0.2 percent of all light passenger vehicles in use globally today, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The good news is that their numbers are growing about 60 percent per year. In the United States, customers bought 53,000 electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles in the first six months of 2017 — not counting Tesla sales — up from 33,000 in the same period a year ago.
A poster that comic artist Walt Kelly prepared for the first Earth Day in 1970.
Momentum is growing in the EV industry. Tesla briefly this year enjoyed the highest market cap of any U.S. automaker. In July, Volvo announced that it plans to produce only hybrid or all-electric vehicles by 2019. China, which now leads the world in EV sales, has tough incentives to increase them further. A multi-nation coalition called the Electric Vehicles Initiative — including Canada, China, Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, United Kingdom, and, for now, the United States — is encouraging the global deployment of 20 million EVs by 2020.
IEA cites estimates that the global stock of electric cars will range between 40 million and 70 million by 2025, if governments continue to support R&D, purchase incentives, and charging infrastructure. The transition to EVs may accelerate if, as some experts forecast, they become fully cost competitive with gasoline-powered cars within a decade.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance projects that “cars with a plug [will] account for a third of the global auto fleet by 2040 and displace about 8 million barrels a day of oil production — more than the 7 million barrels Saudi Arabia exports today.”
The Trump administration can be counted on to do what it can to slow this revolution, but 10 states have aggressive programs to promote the adoption of electric vehicles: California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont. Just as with renewable energy, their success may pave the way for similar programs in other states, even “red” ones.
Fiscal conservatives should applaud their efforts to jump-start the EV market. A study by the American Lung Association in California last year documented health costs of $24 billion a year — for lost work days, respiratory illnesses, and premature deaths — from vehicle emissions in just those 10 states. The report estimated an additional $13 billion in climate-related costs (agricultural losses, flooding, fires, etc.). Converting two-thirds of cars on the road to electric vehicles by 2050 would save those states about $21 billion a year, well worth the effort.
And if they succeed, proponents may also prove instrumental in helping U.S. automakers like Tesla, GM, and Ford remain world leaders in the fast-growing market for electric vehicles. The United States can’t afford to be stranded in the slow lane of adapting its economy to climate change while the rest of the world speeds ahead.

Trump EXPLODES In Morning Meltdown Accusing President Obama Of Treason,"GooglePinterestDiggLinkedin Reddit Stumbleupon PrintDeliciousPocketTumblr
Donald Trump threw another temper tantrum on Twitter as the investigation closes in on him.

You know that the investigation must be getting closer to nailing Trump to the wall by how he is acting right now.
Over the last few days, Trump has been trying to blame his crimes on President Obama and Hillary Clinton while simultaneously insisting that no crimes were committed.
…Why did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI, and still hasn’t? It’s all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election!

It has been a hilarious circular firing squad that Trump can’t seem to stop stepping in the middle of, which is exactly the reason why top law firms in this nation want nothing to do with him.
And on Tuesday morning, Trump threw another hissy fit and accused President Obama of colluding with Russia.
You heard that right. Trump just accused President Obama of committing treason against the United States and then he claimed that no collusion exists. Trump then demanded an apology.
The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..

..under a magnifying glass, they have zero “tapes” of T people colluding. There is no collusion & no obstruction. I should be given apology!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2017
These are the rantings and ravings of a desperate man who knows that his time as president and a free man is running out. The reason why President Obama could not act at the time is because Trump was claiming that the election was rigged. Any move Obama made to stop Russia would have drawn cries of election rigging by Trump, especially had he lost due to Russia being stopped. Also, the extent of the meddling was still under investigation and Obama still retaliated by slapping sanctions against Russia prior to leaving office, the very same sanctions Trump is trying to remove.
By accusing President Obama of treason, Trump has crossed yet another line, demonstrating once and for all that he is unfit to hold office and should be impeached.

Trump Backed Off Putin Because ‘What Do You Do? End Up in a Fistfight?’,"Continue reading the main storyShare This Page

PARIS — President Trump said on Wednesday that he had confronted President Vladimir V. Putin twice about whether Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election, and changed the subject after Mr. Putin flatly denied it because, “What do you do? End up in a fistfight?”
Speaking to reporters on Air Force One as he flew to Paris to take part in Bastille Day celebrations, Mr. Trump offered his first extended account of a dramatic closed-door meeting he held with Mr. Putin last week in Hamburg, Germany.
“I said to him, ‘Were you involved in the meddling with the election?’” Mr. Trump recalled. “He said, ‘Absolutely not. I was not involved.’ He was very strong on it. I then said to him, in a totally different way, ‘Were you involved with the meddling?’ He said, ‘I was not — absolutely not.’”
At that point, he said, Mr. Putin shifted the conversation to the war in Syria.
Mr. Trump conceded that he did not ask Mr. Putin a question about the election that he wanted to ask: “Who were you really for? Because I can’t believe that he would have been for me. Me. Strong military, strong borders — he doesn’t care about borders — but strong military. Tremendous.”

Mr. Trump reiterated his denial that his campaign had colluded with the Russians, saying it was a media witch hunt abetted by the Democrats, who he said had overplayed their hand. “When they say ‘treason,’ you know what treason is? That’s Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for giving the atomic bomb, O.K.?”

Even by Mr. Trump’s freewheeling standards, his comments were unguarded. They came during an impromptu visit to the press cabin about 90 minutes after Air Force One took off from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Wednesday. The White House initially put the session off the record, but then released excerpts from Mr. Trump’s remarks on Thursday after he asked why reporters had not published his statements.
In buoyant spirits despite one of his most bruising weeks as president, Mr. Trump ranged across domestic and foreign issues during the 60-minute session, from China and North Korea to immigration, health care and tax policy. But it was on Russia, which has all but consumed his White House in recent days, that Mr. Trump’s remarks were most revealing.

“He didn’t say that,” Mr. Trump said. “No. He said, ‘I think he accepted it, but you’ll have to ask him.’ That’s a big difference.”
Mr. Trump again raised the prospect that countries other than Russia could have carried out the hacking, although four United States intelligence agencies concluded that Russia was solely responsible.
China and North Korea are also skilled at hacking, he said, pointing out that the North Koreans had infiltrated the internal computers of Sony Pictures. “I’m not saying it wasn’t Russia,” Mr. Trump said. “What I’m saying is that we have to protect ourselves no matter who it is.”
“Whether it’s Russia or anybody else,” he added, “we can’t let there be even a scintilla of doubt when it comes to an election.”
Mr. Trump also expressed sympathy for China’s unwillingness to do more to pressure North Korea to curb its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. China, he said, had been locked in conflict with its neighbor for “many, many centuries.” President Xi Jinping does not want “50 million people pouring across his border” from a collapsed North Korea. (The C.I.A. estimates North Korea’s population is about 25 million.)

“I understand the other side,” he said. “You always have to understand the other side.” He said of Mr. Xi, “I have a very good relationship with him. I think he’s a tremendous guy. But don’t forget. He’s for China. I’m for the U.S.”
Still, Mr. Trump said trade would give the United States leverage to pressure China to lean harder on its rogue neighbor. He said he was contemplating tariffs and quotas on Chinese steel, which he said was being dumped in the American market.
He also noted that the United States had begun renegotiating a trade agreement with South Korea, which he described as a “bad deal” and a “Hillary Clinton beauty.” President George W. Bush originally negotiated the South Korea trade deal in 2007.
Turning to immigration, Mr. Trump said he had not been joking when he said recently that a wall on the Mexican border would pay for itself if it had solar panels.
He also said the wall would have to be transparent, using an offbeat example to explain why.
“When they throw large sacks of drugs over, and if you have people on the other side of the wall, you don’t see them — they hit you on the head with 60 pounds of stuff? It’s over,” he said. “As crazy as that sounds, you need transparency through that wall.”

Republican tax code revamp hits House budget obstacle,"WASHINGTON Republican efforts to overhaul the U.S. tax code have hit a snag in the House of Representatives, where party infighting over spending cuts is delaying adoption of a key legislative tool that the party needs to move a tax bill forward.
The House Budget Committee canceled plans to send a budget resolution for fiscal 2018 to the floor this week, lawmakers said on Tuesday, as conservative Republicans pushed to add hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to the spending blueprint that would take effect Oct. 1.
House and Senate passage of a budget resolution is vital to President Donald Trump's pledge to deliver on tax reform this year because the document would free Republicans to circumvent Democratic opposition in the Senate. But the push for cuts to programs including Medicaid and food stamps, which benefit the poor, threatens to engulf the debate in a Republican free-for-all that could end in a stalemate.
""No budget, no tax reform,"" said Representative Mark Walker, who chairs the Republican Study Committee, a group of more than 150 conservative lawmakers. ""That's why there should be a sense of urgency to get this done pretty quick.""
The drive to reduce spending could also make a tax overhaul harder to pass if cuts in programs for the poor appear in the same legislation as lower taxes for the wealthy, aides say.
Top Trump administration officials and Republican leaders in Congress are working behind closed doors to agree on a tax proposal that can be unveiled as legislation in September.
Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a leading member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, is pushing to cut as much as $400 billion over a decade from a wide range of programs that benefit the poor. Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows said he wanted another $295 billion in cuts on top of that.
""It has to be linked to tax reform, because we believe tax reform is going to happen,"" Jordan said in an interview.
The budget committee canceled its plans this week after the chairmen of several other panels pushed back against efforts to include $250 billion in spending cuts, a sum that some conservatives say is too low.
""The end game is to get a budget out of the committee,"" House Budget Committee Chairwoman Diane Black told reporters. ""I do see a viable path. And I am going to continue to push.""

Holy Crap! Look Who Just Tried To Enter The U.S. & Was Stopped SECONDS Before It Was Too Late,"At Boston’s Logan Airport, a tragedy was narrowly avoided. Coming in from Iran, with a valid visa, posing as a Cancer research doctor was one Seyed Mohsen Dehnavi, who is a top figure in Iran’s Basij Military Force.
As to how a fake identity was not discovered, or who approved his visa, we don’t know, but the fact is that a man of this level in Iran could only have been coming in for one purpose:Terror.
John Kerry, in his usual “foot in mouth” style, jumped the gun and Tweeted how bad it was that we are sending away Cancer researchers…Welcome to reality Mr. Kerry. Not all Muslim Migrants are desperate to fit in and join the American way of life. The reality is that when you treat people as a block, you are guilty of ignoring both the bad and the good elements, and in today’s dangerous world (made dangerous during Kerry and Obama’s time in office), we cannot afford to take these security risks.
President Trump has called this right. Proper, intensive screening needs to be in place to protect the nation’s people. If you can’t provide background information to a satisfactory level , “You Can’t Come In!” Almost every other nation on earth has proper visa systems and checks in place, why shouldn’t the US?
We don’t hear much about Iran these days, but what has just happened will send a chill up and down your spine.
While the world as a whole is focused on the fat nut job in North Korea or the fake Russian collusion charges against members of the Trump administration. Everyone seems to have forgotten the evil that is coming out from the “Religion of Peace” following nation that is Iran. This time an Iranian citizen identified as a senior member of the country’s Basij military force was apprehended trying to enter the United States via Boston’s Logan Airport.
According to multiple sources familiar with the situation, he was posing as a Cancer Researcher. Once he was discovered he was put on the first commercial flight back to Iran. How is it that this terrorist got a visa to come to the US, to begin with? And why wasn’t he arrested and questioned for information before being sent back to Iran?
The Scambag Muslim was identified as Seyed Mohsen Dehnavi, who is a member of Iran’s highly vetted volunteer Basij force.

Of course, because American Liberals are always on the side of our enemies. Former US Secretary of State and Traitor to his fellow Vietnam veterans, John “Lurch” Kerry wasted no time in shimming in on this debacle.
Tragic. A doctor comes to the US to save lives and this happens. This is not who we are. https://t.co/l0kOaP4Xa1

Mr. Kerry-Heinz seems to have forgotten that Iran has constantly said they want to wipe Israel and the US off the map. But it doesn’t matter to him. We all know Kerry hates this nation, probably even more than the Iran does.
Is this the real reason Obama is giving Iran $11.9 billion?
This story was first reported back in January but in light of recent developments it’s quite relevant today. The whole Iranian nuclear “deal” is exploding (pun intended) in the face of the Obama administration. The fact that President Obama is dispatching Secretary Kerry to Capitol Hill to stand against Congressional oversight of this fiasco is quite disconcerting.
But a Fox News report from earlier this year should cause all of you great concern. In January, the Obama administration paid $490 million in cash assets to Iran and will have released a total of $11.9 billion to the Islamic Republic by the time nuclear talks are scheduled to end in June, according to figures provided by the State Department.”
The Free Beacon says yesterday’s $490 million release, “the third such payment of this amount since Dec. 10 [2014], was agreed to by the Obama administration under the parameters of another extension in negotiations over Tehran’s contested nuclear program that was inked in November [2014]. Iran will receive a total of $4.9 billion in unfrozen cash assets via 10 separate payments by the United States through June 22 [2015], when talks with Iran are scheduled to end with a final agreement aimed at curbing the country’s nuclear work, according to a State Department official.”
“Iran received $4.2 billion in similar payments under the 2013 interim agreement with the United States and was then given another $2.8 billion by the Obama administration last year in a bid to keep Iran committed to the talks through November, when negotiators parted ways without reaching an agreement. Iran will have received a total of $11.9 billion in cash assets by the end of June if current releases continue on pace as scheduled.”
Folks, we are so stupid that we are paying the Iranians to “diss” us and stall this process. In other words, Iranian belligerence pays, and pays quite well. So the economic sanctions are being lifted and the Grand Ayatollah has demanded they end immediately.
So what are we gaining in this whole debacle? We shared with you yesterday that Russia has lifted the ban on the sale of the S-300 anti-aircraft missile system to Iran. Russian President Putin has declared the ban as “unnecessary.” I’m starting to believe this whole endeavor with Iran is unnecessary — if not abjectly insane. I fail to see how any of this is to the benefit of the United States, certainly the global community, and our ally Israel. We are slowly providing an economic recovery to Iran — while our own economy struggles.
Just to give you a comparative assessment, the Free Beacon says, “between November 2014 and July 2015, the interim deal’s direct forms of sanctions relief will allow Iran access to roughly $4.9 billion in frozen money,” US Senator Mark Kirk (R-Ill) told the Washington Free Beacon “That’s equal to what it’d cost Iran to fund Hezbollah for as much as 50 years.”
I am not a conspiracy theorist, but you just have to ask as a point of inquiry — does all of this have anything to do with Valerie Jarrett who has an Iranian background? In fact, WND reports in 2012 “Jarrett was the main and central player in behind-the-scene talks between U.S. and Iran leaders, according to an independent Persian-language blog.The blog said Jarrett “attempted to facilitate communication between officials on both sides.”
WND says, “retired Lt. Gen. William G. “Jerry” Boykin, former deputy undersecretary of defense for intelligence under President George W. Bush, spotlighted Jarrett’s influence in a Fox News interview in February.”
“There are many who are now saying that [Jarrett] is really the architect of this non-treaty with the Iranians,” he said, “which ultimately will result in the Iranians having a nuclear program, and America having to accept a nuclear-armed Iran.”
Whatever your theory, there is a reason why President Obama wants no Congressional eyes on this “deal” or their Constitutional right of approval.
Why is Obama so vehemently against any action from our Congressional representatives? Why are we rewarding the bad behavior of the Islamic regime in Iran — especially as they are holding four Americans hostage? Something smells very bad here and regardless of your political affiliation you must admit that — unless permanently damaged by the kool-aid poisoning.
If you feel this is acceptable, well, you are very wrong.
Liberal scumbags like John Kerry better start checking themselves. Their hatred towards President Donald Trump is so damn rabid that they would rather side with an enemy that is hell bent on the destruction of the western world.
They keep repeating “This isn’t who we are” every damn time President Trump talks about banning immigration from terrorist hotbeds until we can sort out who these people are. No matter what you believe our values are as a nation there is one thing I do know if we keep letting Muslims into this country we won’t be the United States of America for long.",Freedom’s Final Stand,1
Banks seek clarity on provisions for accounts being sent to NCLT,"Lenders have sought clarification from the RBI on provisions to be made for accounts being sent to the NCLT, sources told FE, adding that the issue was discussed at the recent meeting with the RBI. (Reuters)
Lenders have sought clarification from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on provisions to be made for accounts being sent to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), sources told FE, adding that the issue was discussed at the recent meeting with the RBI. According to a senior public sector banker, lenders are wary of auditors who in the past sought 100% provisioning to be made in case of companies that are being sent for insolvency and bankruptcy (IBC) proceedings. Banks have sough clarification from the RBI citing existing income recognition and asset classification (IRAC) norms which are already being followed. “We are of the opinion that we will keep increasing the provisions for such accounts as they are and not immediately after moving NCLT,” the banker said, adding that it would put an unnecessary burden on the bank. The banks are expecting easier provisioning norms for these accounts which are supposed to be sent to the NCLT, he said. According to the RBI regulations, banks are required to set aside a specific sum of money as buffer against a loan that could turn into a non-performing asset.
For every loan disbursed, banks need to provide 0.4% of that loan and 15% towards any loan that turns NPA. The provisions increase to 25% if the account remains an NPA for more than 12 months and is called a doubtful 1 loan. Banks need to provide 40% for doubtful 2 and 100% for accounts that have remained in the NPA category for more than four years. The central bank recently identified 12 large accounts (with exposure of more than Rs5,000 crore and more than 60% of which is recognised as NPAs) which banks have to refer to the IBC. The RBI also said the circular on revised provisioning norms for cases accepted for resolution under the IBC is being issued separately. Once these cases go to IBC, lenders in each of these accounts will have to set up a committee to formulate a plan for resolution. If that cannot be done in a period of 180 days — this can be extended to 270 days — the borrowing entity will go into liquidation.

Analysts at Credit Suisse wrote in a note that the resolutions would need additional provisions. “We estimate 40-60% provision would be needed on the steel accounts and even larger provisions for the others,” they opined. These amounts add up to a little over Rs2 lakh crore, or about 30% of the Rs7 lakh crore worth of gross non-performing assets (NPAs) in the banking system. The central bank has said the 12 accounts on the list constitute about 25% of the current gross NPAs of the banking system. In early May, the President of India had approved an ordinance amending the Banking Regulation Act 1949, giving more powers to the RBI to deal with non-performing assets. Earlier, the Union cabinet had approved a proposal to amend Section 35 of the BR Act. The extent of the NPA problem can be gauged from the fact that around Rs10 lakh crore of loans are either non-performing or stressed; this is roughly 12% of total loans.",Financial Express,0
BREAKING: N. Korea Just Made TERRIFYING Announcement – Washington D.C. is Ready For WAR,"Jon Anthony23 hours ago
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has decided to talk tough in response to the CIA Director’s comments on regime change in Pyongyang. Un has threatened to strike the “heart of the US,” with a nuclear weapon.
Tensions have been increasing between North Korea and the United States ever since Un’s rise to power. Time after time, he’s tested Trump’s patience, with absolutely no regard for national safety.
No matter how many times China and the surrounding countries warned North Korea to stop testing missiles, they didn’t listen. Now, Kim Jong Un may have gone too far by threatening to pummel the “heart of the US.” Newsweek reports:
The North Korean regime has responded to CIA Director Mike Pompeo’s comments on regime change in Pyongyang.
A foreign ministry spokesman was quoted in the state-controlled Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) threatening a nuclear strike to “the heart of the U.S.” should the American secret service attempt to remove Kim Jong Un from power.
‘Should the U.S. dare to show even the slightest sign of attempt to remove our supreme leadership, we will strike a merciless blow at the heart of the U.S. with our powerful nuclear hammer, honed and hardened over time,’ the spokesman said, as the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported on Tuesday.
The North Koreans have just issued an official threat. They are ready to launch an ICBM at “the heart of the US,” which presumably means our very own capital.

If North Korea does decide to start a war with us, they’ll be up against far superior equipment:
The US is for instance setting up the THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) anti-missile system in South Korea aimed at neutralizing missiles launched from the North.
During war exercises last month off the Korean coast, F-35s took off from the flight deck of the Vinson. Also present, reportedly, were the same kind of special forces that took out Osama bin Laden.
If Kim Jong Un is actually serious, the second Korean war would be over just as fast as it started—the destruction would be difficult to resolve.
The United States has far more allies on the world’s stage than North Korea does, and our allies have more powerful military technology than they do. We have millions more people than North Korea has, our economy is larger, and our military budget absolutely DWARFS theirs.
Yet, somehow, this arrogant mini-monster Kim Jong Un thinks it’s a good idea to threaten Washington, D.C. with a nuclear weapon. Well, here’s a taste of what he’s up against:
The United States has the most powerful Navy on the face of the earth—Kim Jong Un would be demolished in seconds. We’ve got over 20,000 submariners, and 72 submarines actively patrolling the world’s oceans as we speak.
We have fast attack submarines, engineered to seek and destroy enemy submarines and ships with unparalleled speed. We have ballistic missile submarines, which serve as completely undetectable launch platforms for nuclear missiles.
We have guided missile submarines, which gives our Navy unprecedented special operation capabilities, from a stealthy, clandestine platform…and as if this wasn’t enough, we have trillions of dollars worth of fighter jets ready to bomb the living hell out of North Korea if we need to.
Just this set of fighter jets alone numbers over 2,000—they have a max speed of 1,200 mph, a max altitude of 50,000 feet, and they can travel for over 1,350 miles on internal fuel tanks alone.
The United States spends nearly $600 billion dollars a year on our military, with this number expected to grow under Donald Trump. China, coming in at second place, spends $215 billion a year on their military.
What about North Korea? They’re not even ranking, coming in at $1.2 billion dollars annually. We spend 600x more than they do on our military, and it’s time to put Kim Jong Un in his place.

SEOUL, South Korea — An American who helped arrange for 30 female peace activists to cross the heavily armed border between North and South Korea in 2015 has been denied entry to South Korea, officials confirmed on Monday.
Christine Ahn, a South Korean-born American citizen, said she did not know she was persona non grata in the country until Asiana Airlines stopped her from boarding a flight at the San Francisco airport on Thursday. She had planned to transit through Incheon International Airport outside Seoul on her way to China, where she intended to spend a week before visiting South Korea.
After being told she was not allowed to transit though South Korea, she bought a new ticket to fly directly to Shanghai, she said.
The Justice Ministry of South Korea said on Monday that Ms. Ahn had been denied entry because there were sufficient grounds to fear that she might “hurt the national interests and public safety” of South Korea.

Ms. Ahn said she suspected that the government of the former president Park Geun-hye, a conservative who was impeached over a corruption scandal and removed from office in March, had put her on a blacklist for helping organize the Women Cross DMZ campaign in May 2015.

In that campaign, a group of 30 female peace activists, including Gloria Steinem and two Nobel Peace Prize laureates, visited North Korea and then crossed the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, into South Korea, calling for a treaty to formally end the Korean War.
“I’m hoping the Moon administration can quickly correct this,” Ms. Ahn wrote in an email from China, referring to President Moon Jae-in, who replaced Ms. Park in May. “It would not look favorably if they’re allowing the dark ages to remain by banning pro-democracy, human rights and peace activists from entering their country.”

While in office, Ms. Park, who took a hard line on North Korea and its nuclear weapons program, had prevented South Korean nongovernmental organizations from making contact with the North. In 2015, her government deported a South Korean-born American citizen who had spoken warmly about her trips to North Korea in public appearances and articles in South Korea.
Some critics in South Korea and the United States opposed the Women Cross DMZ campaign, saying the activists’ trip to North Korea would be used as propaganda by the North’s repressive government. North Korean state media later quoted some of the activists as praising the country’s leaders, but organizers denied that the remarks had been made.
Ms. Ahn, 44, has been an international coordinator for the campaign. On Sunday, two of its members, Ms. Steinem and the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Mairead Maguire, sent letters to Ahn Ho-young, the South Korean ambassador to Washington, urging Seoul to lift the ban on Ms. Ahn.
Ms. Ahn said she was now in China with other female peace activists from the United States and Canada. She had planned to fly to Seoul next Monday, together with another antiwar activist, Mary Ann Wright, a retired United States Army officer and former diplomat.
Ms. Ahn said that Ms. Wright still plans to go to Seoul, where she and other female activists from the United States, Switzerland, Japan and Australia plan to campaign for a peace treaty to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War. Ms. Ahn said there were no indications that Ms. Wright or any of the other activists would be barred from South Korea.
In a speech on July 6, President Moon said his government would push for a peace treaty with North Korea, as part of a comprehensive solution to the crisis over the North’s nuclear weapons program. The Korean War was halted with a cease-fire that left the peninsula still technically at war.

New Evidence Suggests Turin Shroud Was Used to Bury Jesus Christ,"The Turin Shroud is a centuries-old piece of cloth that is believed to have been used to bury Jesus Christ after his crucifixion.
Many scholars dispute its authenticity, saying that it was “discovered” in the Middle Ages to bolster Christianity at a time when the faith was floundering.
But new evidence suggests that the Turin Shroud may have indeed been used to bury Christ.
A new study of the Shroud of Turin lends authenticity to the claim it was the cloth used to bury Jesus Christ following his crucifixion.
Researchers found a high level of creatinine and ferritin in the blood particles present in the linen fabric, indicating that the person wrapped in it was a victim of torture.
“The wide presence of creatinine particles bound to ferrihydrite particles is not a situation typical of the blood serum of a healthy human organism,” said Professor Guilio Fanti of the University of Padua

One thing is clear: Whoever was wrapped in the Turin Shroud was tortured. This suggests that it very well could have been used to wrap Jesus’s crucified body.
Scientists are forever trying to disprove the story of the Bible and Christ’s divinity. This is one more piece of evidence that helps prove Jesus indeed walked the earth and died for our sins.

June 28, 2017 4:07 AM
 
Two 911 calls and a tweet about the possibility of an active shooter at a military installation set off a day of panic and confusion in Alabama.
The emergency calls Tuesday came from within the Redstone Arsenal base near Huntsville and led the installation to tweet a warning to its 30,000 government employees, civilians and contractors: ""run hide fight.""
Police cars with flashing lights rushed to the scene and blocked entrances to the post, home to Army missile defense programs, NASA's rocket propulsion operations and federal law enforcement agencies. Even before any gunfire was confirmed, the governor offered her prayers and social media lit up with worried friends and families talking about the lockdown.
At one point, Redstone spokesman Christopher Colster acknowledged he didn't know whether the lockdown was part of a drill or an actual threat.
In the end, an investigation found there was no active shooter and no shots were fired, garrison commander Col. Tom Holliday said. He said authorities would continue to investigate what happened, including whether the 911 calls were part of a hoax.
""We did have initial reports of someone hearing shots fired and someone seeing a weapon. That in itself drove us to our response,"" he said. ""I would say that the situation that we live in in the United States today leads to caution. Honestly, if we have to overreact, I would rather overreact than underreact.""
He said the phrase used in the tweet — ""run hide fight"" — is a standard response during an active shooter. An active shooter drill planned for Wednesday was canceled.
""We believe we have learned everything we needed to as part of the event today,"" he said, adding that the response worked as designed.
Images on social media showed an ambulance and what appeared to be civilians standing outside the Sparkman Center, which includes offices, an auditorium, cafeteria and an interior courtyard. Holliday said the 911 calls came from the Sparkman complex and that some people who evacuated the building needed medical attention unrelated to the 911 calls.
It took two hours to give the all-clear for the installation and another two hours to make sure the sprawling Sparkman complex was secure.
Amy Jay said her husband, who was working at the Sparkman Center, was told the situation was over through an announcement over the building's public address system.
""Feeling like I can breathe again!"" Jay wrote in a message to The Associated Press. ""My husband is a contractor and a veteran so when we hear things like this we're reminded of what happened at Fort Hood,"" she said, referring to the 2009 shooting at a military base in Texas.
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey's office said after the lockdown was lifted that she didn't know what led to the alert.
""The important thing is everybody's safe,"" Ivey said.

Government accused of ‘years of broken promises’ after dropping schemes to make network faster and greener

Plans to make the railway network faster, greener and cleaner by electrifying lines have been scrapped by the government after massive budget overruns, prompting fury at “years of broken promises”.
The plans to modernise the line from Cardiff to Swansea, the Midland mainline and tracks in the Lake District were dropped on Thursday after Network Rail spent huge sums on engineering works, with costs in the Great Western region alone going as much as £1.9bn over budget.
Network Rail’s electrification works around the country, most notably on the Great Western mainline from London to Swansea, which started in 2014, were described as a vital upgrade that would bring cleaner, faster and more reliable services for passengers.
However, the government claimed on Thursday that passengers would benefit from “modern bi-mode trains” instead, and would no longer have to put up with “disruptive electrification works” and “intrusive wires and masts”.
Most of the 122 InterCity Express trains ordered from Hitachi at a cost of £5.7bn will now have to be bi-mode, fitted with diesel engines to run on non-electrified lines. The cost of the upgrade has not been confirmed, and the bi-mode trains are believed to be less efficient than purely electric due to the additional weight of the engines and smaller capacity.
The news was met with anger in Wales in particular, after the government had given repeated guarantees that work would be concluded despite the problems Network Rail had experienced on Great Western. The cost of electrifying the line has more than tripled from its original budget to £2.8bn. A Welsh government spokesperson said the “disturbing news ... amounted to years of broken promises”.
The government announced in 2015 that it was “pausing” electrification of the Midland mainline, but insisted the work would be completed. The announcement that the line to Nottingham and Sheffield will be served by bi-mode trains using diesel engines confirmed that Network Rail’s budget overruns will leave large parts of the country without the “electric spine” that the government had boasted would bring more capacity and increase jobs and investment.
The news will raise further doubts over the electrification of the TransPennine route between Manchester and Leeds, which was also described as “paused” in 2015, but had been seen as a critical part of the “northern powerhouse”.
The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, told the Commons in a written statement that the Hitachi trains – ordered in a deal first announced in 2009 – meant electrification was no longer needed.
“New bi-mode train technology offers seamless transfer from diesel power to electric that is undetectable to passengers ... This means that we no longer need to electrify every line to achieve the same significant improvements to journeys, and we will only electrify lines where it delivers a genuine benefit to passengers,” he said.
Labour said the news showed the Conservatives had been “taking people for a ride”. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: “The decision betrays a promise to south Wales, and the transport secretary sneaking out the news on the final day before he goes on his summer holidays adds insult to injury.
“The Tories do not act in the interests of the whole UK. They have put their own survival, finding £1bn for a deal with the DUP, ahead of everything else and it’s communities like those in south Wales that pay the price.”
McDonald later led calls for Grayling to to defend the “disastrous U-turn” to MPs in the Commons, rather than sneaking out a statement which was “of massive economic detriment to the country.”
The incoming chair of the transport select committee, Lilian Greenwood, said the announcement was bad news for passengers and “raised serious questions about the government’s willingness to invest in the long-term future of our railways and their commitment to the decarbonisation of transport”.
The Department for Transport said passengers would now have newer trains earlier. The Hitachi trains will come into service on Great Western from the autumn, switching to diesel on parts of the route that Network Rail has failed to electrify. Hitachi said the bi-mode trains would still be more environmentally friendly than the existing fleet, whether running on electric or diesel.
In a signal that years of spending on upgrading the rail network could be coming to an end, the government has also declined to commit to any infrastructure enhancements in a document outlining a five-year plan for Network Rail.
The previous high-level output statement, from 2012, was the catalyst for what the government described as the biggest investment since Victorian times.
Lianna Etkind of the Campaign for Better Transport said: “It’s deeply concerning that when so much money is being poured into concreting over the countryside, rail expansion is in doubt.”",The Guardian – Politics,0

The pale, limp body of a four-year-old boy sped by, submerged in the fast current of the Little North Santiam River.
There was no time to think. Jason McDade plunged into the frigid, swirling water and pushed the boy's body toward the surface.
Balancing on a slippery rock with water reaching his collar bone, McDade lifted the boy onto a higher rock in the middle of the river.
""I got him! I got him!"" McDade screamed, trying to keep his own head above water.
The boy's body was white, lips blue and eyes rolled back when McDade yelled to others at North Fork Park on Sunday.
""I wasn't paying attention to the current, I was more focused on getting the baby out,"" McDade said. ""My adrenaline was going so fast.""
McDade was one of four visitors at the recreation area who helped rescue the boy after he was swept down river from the upper pool, submerged through the rapids and into the lower pool. He slipped in while standing with his father and siblings near the water's edge, according to Marion County Sheriff's Office.
Kelda Klukis, of Salem, had just set up chairs for her boyfriend and three children when she saw McDade emerge from the water with the boy in his arms.
""There was no movement or reflexes from him, even when Jason was running over rocky terrain with him,"" Klukis said. ""He was lifeless.""

Klukis, a certified nursing assistant for 17 years, said the boy had ""the look"" of death.
Despite the signs, Klukis ran toward the boy while still holding her8-month-old baby. Maryela Lozano, a registered nurse, had already started CPR. Klukis handed her baby to someone in the growing crowd.
The boy wasn't breathing. He had no pulse.
His mother screamed in the background and family members cried as Klukis did chest compressions and Lozano delivered mouth-to-mouth for five minutes until the boy finally took a breath.
""When everybody else is in a state of shock, it's my time to focus,"" Klukis said. ""For him not to survive was not an option.""
Color returned to his face as he coughed water onto the gravel and cried.
Klukis pulled the boy's mother close, so she could see and feel her son's breathing. ""As a mother, I understand, so I wanted her to see that her son was going to be okay,"" she said.
Klukis' children were watching the rescue take place, which was the first time her kids watched her use CPR to save a life.
""It's one thing for me to come home from work and say 'I used CPR.' but it's another thing to see a four-year-old who lost his life and us be able to get it back for him,"" Klukis said.
Paramedics arrived shortly after and transported him to Santiam Hospital in Stayton. He is expected to make a full recovery.
The boy has not been identified by the Marion County Sheriff's Office and his family declined to speak publicly about the incident.
Klukis said she hopes people learn about the importance of safety in the outdoors, especially in water recreation areas. The boy was not wearing a life vest at the time of the incident.
""It was an amazing feeling to see him breathe again,"" Klukis said, ""but it's important for people to realize how important life jackets are because keeping family safe is the number one priority.""

"Trump, Putin had second, undisclosed talk at G-20","President Trump held a second, informal talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G-20) summit in Hamburg, Germany, earlier this month, the White House confirmed Tuesday.
Press secretary Sean Spicer confirmed Trump and Putin spoke at the G-20 heads of state dinner, hours after their formal bilateral sit-down.
According to Tuesday reports, in their second conversation, Trump spoke with the Russian leader for roughly an hour, joined only by Putin's translator. The meeting had previously gone without mention by the administration.
The White House confirmed that Trump and Putin spoke at a dinner for G-20 leaders and their spouses. But a White House official appeared to dispute that the discussion lasted an hour, saying the two only spoke ""briefly"" near the end of the dinner.
""There was no 'second meeting' between President Trump and President Putin, just a brief conversation at the end of a dinner,"" the official said. ""The insinuation that the White House has tried to 'hide' a second meeting is false, malicious and absurd.""
The White House said the two men used the Russian translator to converse because the American translator accompanying President Trump spoke Japanese.
Trump arrived at the dinner just after 7 p.m. local time, according to a pool report. He did not depart the dinner venue until a few minutes before midnight.
The dinner was scheduled to last from 8:30 p.m. to 10 p.m., according to an official G-20 schedule.
The president's interactions with Putin are the subject of particularly intense scrutiny in the U.S., because of the ongoing special counsel and congressional investigations into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow.
The official said talking with world leaders is part of the president's job.
""It is not merely perfectly normal, it is part of a president's duties, to interact with world leaders. Throughout the G-20 and in all his other foreign engagements, President Trump has demonstrated American leadership by representing our interests and values on the world stage,"" the official said.
That Trump was not joined in the conversation by his own translator is a breach of national security protocol, according to Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, though one that the president likely would not know about.
Trump and Putin met for a formal discussion during the G-20 summit — a meeting that was scheduled to last 30 minutes but exceeded two hours.
Bremmer said in an interview with Bloomberg's Charlie Rose that the rapport Trump established with Putin during the summit is ""clearly his best personal relationship"" with a G-20 leader.
""Never in my life as a political scientist have I seen two countries — major countries — with a constellation of national interests that are as dissonant, while the two leaders seem to be doing everything possible to make nice and be close to each other,"" he said.
During the formal meeting, Trump reportedly pressed Putin about Moscow's efforts to meddle in the 2016 election, which the Russian president denied.

Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story!
Right-wingers have taken to sending death threats to Andrew Kaczynski, the CNN reporter who wrote and published a piece claiming to know the identity of the Reddit troll who created he “Trump-CNN-smackdown” GIF.
According to The Daily Beast, Kaczynski, who heads up the network’s “K-File” investigative program, his wife and his parents have all received threats from an amalgamation of far-right trolls intent on “doxxing” him due to what appears to be a threat to do the same to Reddit user HanAssholeSolo, the creator of the GIF.
According to the Beast, Kaczynski’s family are the recipients of at least 50 threatening or harassing phone calls, and other members of the K-File team also received harassing messages after the information began cropping up on 4chan’s politics board (the initial site of the calls to dox K-File).
“The only thing I worry about is somebody getting hurt,” an anonymous source told the Beast. “These far-right trolls are really threatening people and coming after people. Somebody’s gonna do something stupid at some point.
Despite reassurances that the network has no intention to reveal HanAssholeSolo’s name or identity, the trolls (which are made up of members of 4-chan, the white supremacist Daily Stormer’s “troll army” and other groups) are “preemptively doxxing” K-File as punishment for a controversial statement at the end of the Kaczynski’s initial piece that some believed was a form a blackmail.
The beginning of the K-File doxxing campaign came when a popular alt-right Twitter claimed HanAssholeSolo was a queer 15-year-old supporter of President Donald Trump, though CNN denies the claim and says he’s actually an adult man.

The start of a Trump crackdown on leakers? 04:48
(CNN)The Republican chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee released a new report Thursday warning that the recent influx of classified leaks to the media pose risks to national security.
Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said that under President Donald Trump, ""leaks are flowing at the rate of one a day,"" and his committee found at least 125 news stories ""with leaked information potentially damaging to national security,"" mainly, but not exclusively, related to Russian meddling in the US election, according to articles reviewed by Johnson's staff between January and May.
""But the leak frenzy has gone far beyond the Kremlin and has extended to other sensitive information that could harm national security,"" the report said. ""President Trump's private conversations with other foreign leaders have shown up in the press, while secret operations targeting America's most deadly adversaries were exposed in detail.""
CNN was among the more than a dozen news organizations included in the survey, which included The New York Times, NBC, the Associated Press and The Wall Street Journal.
FBI restricts contact between its employees and media
Johnson also sent the findings to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, saying in a letter Thursday he wanted to make the Justice Department ""aware of the results of this examination"" and hoped it will prove ""useful to the relevant investigative entities.""
CNN has reached out to Johnson's office for additional comment and has not yet received a response.
Following a diplomatic dust-up over leaks to the media during the UK's investigation into the Manchester terrorist attack in May, Sessions said that leaks ""cannot be tolerated"" and pledged to ""make every effort to put an end to it.""
Thus far, at least one former government contractor has been charged with leaking classified information to a news outlet since Trump took office.

"Muslim Pedophile Refugee Says Raping Girls Is Part Of His Culture, Fed-Up Judge Dropped 5 Words And Sent Him To His Knees","While we can acknowledge, and much of the time, endure or even appreciate the distinctions among the different societies that our reality shows. In any case, all things considered, there are sure practices that must rise above social contrasts. For instance, murder and robbery are ethically wrong and should subject the culprit to equity paying little respect to what social or religious convictions such a man holds.
The majority of this ought to be obvious to the point that remark ought not be essential. Without the restriction and discipline of the individuals who submit abhorrent acts, society is impractical, and the delight in life and one’s opportunities are debilitated, now and again for all time.
Subsequently, when we have a Muslim refugee person who has been indicted raping four young girls, he is meriting only the most serious discipline as given by law. His ask for mercy since he asserts that assault is a piece of his way of life is without justifying, as well as is hostile in the extraordinary. Luckily the judge saw the issue similarly expressing that, “behavior of this nature is abhorred in virtually every civilized culture on this earth.”
This is an account of a lamentable choice by one judge being adjusted by the second.
“In July 2017, Zohair Tomari once again made headlines when the 20-year-old Syrian seeker reappeared before the court for raping underage girls. Despite Tomari being convicted of child sex trafficking for raping a pair of 15- and 17-year-old white British girls in 2016, an unnamed judge in the UK’s Coventry Crown Court released him on a bail. Of course, Tomari celebrated his freedom by raping 2 more white British girls, ages 13 and 14. Fortunately, Tomari’s case was transferred to another court, putting the refugee under the jurisdiction of a judge who has a common sense. “
Whatever misinforming thinking the main judge utilized as a part of releasing this risky criminal on safeguard, he or she bears a portion of the obligation regarding empowering this youthful criminal to rape two more young ladies. Luckily, the judge who heard the second case was not arranged to turning hazardous attackers free notwithstanding when they making ludicrous interests to their way of life.
“Fria Tider reports that in a bid to invoke sympathy from the judge, Tomari’s defense attorney spoke on behalf of him, claiming that the Syrian refugee” perhaps did not understand the culture of this country. “It was then that Judge Lockhart brought down the hammer . Irate at this ridiculous excuse, Justice Lockhart informed defense attorney Jason Pegg that the culture Tomari will integrate into now is prison culture because “the behavior of this nature is abhorred in virtually every civilized culture on this earth.” With that, Tomari was ordered to register As a sex offender for the rest of his life and the trial was dismissed, according to the Coventry Telegraph. “
“Instead of capitulating to the left’s notion that even though certain cultures are barbaric, we should respect them, Judge Lockhart made a righteous judgment to uphold the laws of his country, dismissing the Islamic privilege Tomari hoped to use in his favor. Additionally, he concluded that because he believes Tomari will continue his crime spree, he will be forever tracked by federal authorities. “
There is no legitimate social, religious, or ideological order that grants one individual to kill, assault, loot, victimize, or generally harm someone else or his or her property. Period. End of open deliberation.
Any religion or belief system that shows that these things are admissible in any conditions is an offense against mankind and must be summarily condemned.

"American student detained in China doing OK, senator's spokeswoman says","CBS/APJuly 20, 2017, 4:07 PM
 
Guthrie McLean seen in an undated photo.

BILLINGS, Mont. -- A spokeswoman for a U.S. lawmaker says an American college student arrested after an altercation with a taxi driver in China has reported no physical or mental health concerns related to his detention.
A spokeswoman for U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, Marnee Banks, said the U.S. Embassy in Beijing provided details Thursday on the status of Guthrie McLean after the University of Montana student was visited by a consular official.
McLean was arrested in the city of Zhengzhou Sunday and accused of intentionally injuring the taxi driver, according to family friend Tom Mitchell.
Mitchell says McLean was trying to protect his mother after the driver attempted to rough her up following a fare dispute that took place on June 10.
Tester had urged the State Department to intervene in the case.
The Zhengzhou municipal public security bureau, when contacted by The Associated Press, said it does not take inquiries about individual cases. The U.S. Embassy in Beijing referred questions to spokesmen in Washington.
McLean grew up in China, where his mother Jennifer McLean teaches English. In recent years he has been enrolled at the University of Montana, according to CBS News affiliate in Missoula, Montana, KPAX-TV.
In late May, McLean went to China to visit her in Zhengzhou, southwest of Beijing, his mother told KPAX.
As Jennifer tells it, on June 10, she took a cab home and the fare came to 70 Renminbi, or $10.36. Jennifer paid with a 100 Renminbi note and, Mitchell said, that's when the trouble began.
""He basically refused to give her the proper change,"" Mitchell told KPAX. ""There then was a bit of an argument and the taxi driver started to rough Jennifer up. So, she describes him pushing and shoving her, grabbing her bags; she was very scared. She was able to call Guthrie and he saw what was happening. He pulled the taxi driver off her, threw him to the ground, and end of story. Or so it seemed.""
Five weeks later, police in Zhengzhou came looking for McLean. The cab driver said he suffered serious bodily injury, and McLean was asked to pay 100,000 Renminbi, or about $14,800, as a settlement. Unable to pay, McLean was taken into custody and given an arrest notice, but not formally charged.
He's been held since Sunday on bond of 50,000 Renminbi (or $7,300), Jennifer told CBS News.
""What that allows them to do is then transfer him to a detention center, sort of a holding facility while they decide along with a prosecutor whether or not to formally charge Guthrie,"" Mitchell explained.
Those agencies have approximately 30 days to decide whether or not to press charges, during which time McLean will remain behind bars. If no charges are filed, he will be free to go, but if the case is brought to trial, Guthrie could remain in custody for some time, Mitchell told KPAX.
""You could end up actually sitting in the detention center for the better part of a year waiting for the police and prosecutors to finish their investigation, at which time it goes to trial,"" Mitchell said.
Jennifer McLean said she has reached out to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, but Zhengzhou falls under the Henan Consulate's jurisdiction. Efforts are being made to get help from the consulate.
""Senator Tester's office was informed of this incident on Monday, and within minutes contacted the State Department and the U.S. Embassy in China,"" Tester's spokeswoman said in a statement. ""Senator Tester is working closely and urgently with officials here and abroad to secure Mr. McLean's quick release and to safely resolve this matter.""
Daines' office told KPAX he has reached out to the State Department, the U.S. Embassy and the Chinese Embassy.
Jennifer McLean told CBS News she's been told State Department personnel might attempt to visit Guthrie Friday.

Polycarbonate or High Index? Bifocals or Progressives? How to Pick What’s Right for You and Save Money,"Written by Ben Davis
Apart from getting the right frames for your prescription eyeglasses, it’s a must to select the right lens type too. They are more important and cost more than frames. When the various types of lens materials and coatings are put into consideration, discovering the lens that meet your eye correction needs may be a daunting task. The truth is that many people spend more money on eyeglasses when it is time to replace the old ones and still end up with a pair that worsens their eye conditions. Whether you require a single vision or multi vision lenses, this guide can go a long way in understanding the popular types of lenses that are available.
Several decades ago, eyeglasses were made from glass materials which get broken easily and are heavier. Most of today’s lenses are designed from high-tech plastics. Generally, polycarbonate lenses are impact-resistant. They are also lighter than the regular plastic lenses and are very durable. People that participate in sporting activities or work in an environment that requires safety googles find it a great choice. In addition, it’s popularly used in the manufacturing of children’s eyewear. Polycarbonate lens usually comes with a 100% built-in UV protection.
· High index lens
Lenses become heavier and thicker as an individual’s prescription gets stronger. Due to the fact that high index lenses have a higher index of refraction, they are relatively lighter and thinner than CR-39 lenses. These types of lenses works best for a very strong prescription. Even though high index lenses are lightweight in appearance, they are made from materials that are shatter proof.
In case you have more than one vision problem, wearing a bifocal lens eliminates the need to carry more than one pair of glasses around. Bifocal lenses are very powerful and works by combining distance vision and near vision prescription into a single lens. They are the most popular type of multifocal eyeglasses and are usually prescribed for age-related eye problems. The other type is the trifocal lens.
Just like polycarbonate lenses, progressive lenses are impact-resistant. They are usually manufactured with polycarbonate, CR-39 and high-index lenses. It is important to note that they are more expensive than bifocal lenses. The wearer can enjoy the benefits of bifocal lenses and use their eyeglasses without horizontal lines in their lenses. Using progressive lenses provide an unnoticeable transition in lens strength.
Once you’ve discovered the appropriate lens for your eyes, endeavor to get in touch with your eye doctor and request for an up-to-date eyeglass prescription. They can also offer insights on the best eyeglass lenses that are available.
Check out some tips on how to save money on prescription eyeglasses
* There are so many eyeglasscoatingslike anti-scratch, anti-reflective, UV-blocking and photochromic treatment, but you don’t need all of them. Avoid purchasing eyeglasses with multiple coatings as they cost more.
* Ordering for eyeglasses online is a sure way to save money and get nothing short of the best. The bottom line is to contact only authentic suppliers.
* Eyeglasses from high-end designer brands are very expensive. The good thing is that you can also get a high-quality pair from a reliable lesser known brand at an affordable price.",NewsExaminer.net,1
INSIDE JOB: Loretta Lynch Did Something SICK For Russian Lawyer Who Met Trump Jr…This Is BAD,"Joker 4 hours agoNews, Politics, USA, World63 Views
This whole Russian lawyer meeting with Donald Trump Jr reeks of something foul, folks. Did you hear how the lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was originally DENIED a visa to the United Stated in 2015?
Well, that Prompted Chuck Grassley to do some digging, and guess what he found out about her and Obama’s old Attorney General…
Loretta Lynch gave Veselnitskaya special permission to enter the United States.
I am not even kidding, folks. According to The Hill, Lynch granted the Russian a special visa to re-enter the US so that she could defend some Russian businessman.
It gets even worse. Assistant US Attorney Paul Monteleoni told a federal judge during a court hearing on January 6, 2016:
“In October [2015] the government bypassed the normal visa process and gave a type of extraordinary permission to enter the country called immigration parole. That’s a discretionary act that the statute allows the Attorney General to do in extraordinary circumstances.”
So this lawyer, who was allegedly carrying information proving Hillary Clinton was connected to Moscow, was let in by Attorney General Loretta Lynch herself. Is that even remotely acceptable?
Nope. Not one bit. However, you know it’s up to us to turn this from a back page story into a front page one. Help share this out everywhere so the whole country can see the twisted truth…

The U.S. Navy's Stealthy Zumwalt Class Destoyer: America’s New 'Pocket' Battleships?,"The three new Zumwalt-class destroyers are in trouble. Originally envisioned as a fleet of more nearly three dozen destroyers, and the weapons that justified them, the Zumwalts have faced delays, cuts and staggering cost increases. As the ships teeter on the verge of white elephant status, could they become relevant again by taking on a new role, that of a stealthy ship killer?
The Zumwalt-class destroyers were originally envisioned as a fleet of thirty-two destroyers designed to attack targets far inland with precision-guided howitzer shells. Designed in part to support amphibious landings by the U.S. Marine Corps, the Zumwalts were meant to make up for the lack of big-gun firepower caused by the retirement of the Iowa-class destroyers.
Unfortunately, cost overruns and technical problems caused the Pentagon to trim the number of Zumwalts to just three ships. Even worse, the service has decided the long-range attack-projectile shells that justified the ships are too expensive to purchase. This puts the remaining fleet in a poor position to support future naval landings, as only one ship is likely to be at sea at any given time.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy is witnessing the rapid rise of the People’s Liberation Army Navy. The PLAN was barely a force to be reckoned with as early as 2000, when the Zumwalt class was in early development. Today, the Pentagon describes the PLAN as “the largest Navy in Asia, with more than 300 surface ships, submarines, amphibious ships, and patrol craft.” While the United States and China are not direct adversaries, aggressive Chinese activity in the South and East China Seas outside of international norms and against U.S. allies could bring the two into conflict. Similarly, Russia has increased the use of its navy in the Baltic, the Mediterranean and the Pacific.
The stealthy nature of the Zumwalt class, whose design reduces the ship’s radar signature to that of a small fishing boat, lends itself to operating in enemy waters. Coupled with a large magazine of missiles, the Zumwalt class could become the ideal warship for an aggressive antisurface-ship role. Operating as a lone wolf but fully networked into the U.S. Navy’s battle network, a Zumwalt could be sent to hunt down and destroy enemy task forces far and wide.
The conversion would start with deleting the two 155-millimeter Advanced Gun System howitzers on the bow and replacing them with a large field of Mk. 41 vertical launch systems. Each Mk. 41 can hold a single missile, which in this case will be the new Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM). Removing the guns could free up room for up to two hundred Mk. 41s, resulting in more silo-based firepower than even the Ohio-class guided-missile submarines. The combination of a stealthy ship and stealthy antiship missiles guided by artificial intelligence would make a formidable adversary. Alternately, the two hundred or so silos could be filled with Tactical Tomahawk missiles for a land-attack mission.
A ship-killing Zumwalt would by necessity operate alone, as an escort would be easy for enemy sensors to detect. Fortunately, the combination of the ship’s AN/SPY-3 Multi-Function Radar and SM-2 and ESSM missiles makes for a powerful self-defense suite. The Zumwalts’ eighty Mk. 57 silos, already installed onboard the ship, would be reserved for defensive weapons. The eighty silos could provide a layered defense with a combination of medium-range Standard SM-2 air-defense missiles and short-range Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSM). If the newer SM-6 surface to air missile fits in the Mk. 57, the secondary antiship role of the SM-6 would give the Zumwalts a backup antiship weapon for use against enemy vessels that don’t rate a LRASM.
That’s not to say an attack Zumwalt wouldn’t have any escorts at all. As envisaged, the destroyer would lack any active antisubmarine-warfare systems. Like a carrier strike group, one or two nuclear attack submarines could accompany the Zumwalts into combat, screening for undersea threats. The submarines could also launch diversionary attacks against enemy task groups and scout the waters ahead for enemy surface forces.
The key to the Zumwalt’s success as a hunter-killer would be being properly networked into the rest of the Navy. The ship would receive sighting reports from satellites; MQ-4 Triton high-altitude, long-endurance drones; P-8 Poseidon patrol aircraft; carrier-based aircraft; surface ships; submarines; and air, surface and subsurface drones. The Zumwalt could locate and track an enemy task group by proxy, setting up an ambush when conditions are favorable, without even turning on its radar or sending out drones of its own. As a corollary, the network would help keep the Zumwalt alive, allowing it to outmaneuver dangerous threats.
Creating what would amount to an American pocket battleship, operating alone on the high seas in the face of the enemy, is a risky proposition. Still, the concentration of firepower such a ship could bring to bear also makes it an attractive one, and the ship’s stealthy nature, extensive defensive-weapons capability, and America’s lead in military communications and networking all give it an edge in survivability. While it may mean a few more years in the shipyard, especially for the lead ship already commissioned into the fleet, what will emerge is a ship more suited for the growing task for sinking enemy ships. From the progress America’s potential adversaries are making in shipbuilding, that task isn’t going away anytime soon.

PERS costs are going up at the fastest rate in history, and according to figures provided by PERS, the bite it takes out of public payrolls will nearly double over the next three bienniums. Amy Read /

A special task force convened by Gov. Kate Brown is deciding how to cut $5 billion from the Oregon Public Employees Retirement System's $22 billion in unfunded liability without hurting the retirement benefits of government workers who draw from it.
Options that could be on the table after the group met Monday include selling some state lands and partially or wholly privatizing state agencies, with the proceeds going to the pension liability, the Register Guard reported.
Previously: Gov. Kate Brown appoints a panel to take investigate, clean up PERS
When Brown announced the seven-member task force this spring, she stressed its importance, saying the public pension system's unfunded liability ""looms over nearly every decision that we make."" Pension costs for many Oregon public agencies are increasing by 20 percent this year and similar hikes are expected again in 2019 and in 2021, despite strong stock market returns.
The task force floated the idea of privatizing the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, the state workers' compensation agency or even Oregon Health & Science University. Other ideas include privatizing the state's data center in Salem, its state employee vehicle fleet or highway rest areas or selling state water rights to private interests.
The panel also discussed options that could put the squeeze on school districts or local governments' budgets to help pay down the liability.
One option could be to target entities with big ""rainy day"" reserves, or K-12 schools that receive unexpected new funds, and automatically direct some of that money to the pension crisis.
Similarly, the panel is eyeing timber harvest receipts from federal forests that some counties use to supplement their budgets, as well as big legal settlements — like ones agreed to by tobacco companies or Volkswagen — that now typically go to related causes, the newspaper reported.
The task force might also consider new surcharges on utility bills or on hunting and fishing fees, new local government taxes on alcohol or tobacco, or even a temporary statewide property tax add-on were all mentioned as possible cash generators for PERS.
Brown has set Nov. 1 as the deadline for the group's report and hopes to take some of their recommendations to state lawmakers next year.

Canada PM stands by supply management as US debates NAFTA,"July 18, 2017 8:21 PM
 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says he will continue to defend the supply management system that protects the Canadian dairy industry in talks about revamping the North American Free Trade Agreement.
A U.S. House subcommittee raised the long-standing trade irritant at its hearing on NAFTA negotiations Tuesday, suggesting Canadian measures to protect the industry will be a sticking point.
Congressman Ron Kind, a Democrat from Wisconsin, says he does not want to jeopardize a crucial trading relationship with Canada but thinks the system should be more balanced.
The Trump administration released its objectives for a new trade deal earlier this week, including better access for its agricultural exports.
Trudeau said Tuesday that Canada has signed significant trade deals with Europe, North America and elsewhere while protecting the supply management system.

Trump on health care: We're getting close 01:31
Washington (CNN)Only 17% of Americans approve of the Republican Senate health care bill, with 55% of national adults saying they outright disapprove of it, according to a new poll out Wednesday.
The results from the NPR/ PBS Newshour/Marist survey show that across the board, Americans are unhappy with how the repeal of Obamacare is being handled. The poll was in the field as the details of the GOP bill became public, with interviews conducted Wednesday through Sunday. The bill's text became public on Thursday.
Additionally, President Donald Trump's approval ratings remain low, with independents in particular losing faith in the President's ability to turn around the job market.
Overall, Americans want something to be done to the current state of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, with only 17% wanting the 2010 health care bill to be left completely intact. A quarter of those polled want the bill to be repealed completely, and the figure jumps up to more than half among Republican respondents.

But while the Republican-controlled Senate's proposed plan, known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act, would take the structure of the ACA by having it do less, almost half of respondents to the poll say they want to instead see more done under the ACA. Just 7% of those polled say they want the health care bill to do less.
And the public plans to point fingers if a bill isn't passed. If Congress doesn't go through with a repeal of the ACA, 37% of Americans said they would blame congressional Republicans, 23% would blame Democrats and 15% would blame Trump.

Meanwhile, Trump's approval ratings remain low.
Just 37% of Americans approve of the job the President is doing since he took office, with 51% disapproving, according to the same poll.
The most pronounced change in the polling comes from independent voters. Just 31% of independents said Trump's decisions as President have strengthened the US economy, down from 44% three months ago.
Lee Miringoff, the director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, told NPR that ""on issues like the direction of the country and the economy, they've really soured on him. It's hard for someone like him to make a second impression. Independents have come to the conclusion that what you see is what you get.""
When asked about Trump's leadership skills, independents also believed Obama was more effective, 65% to Trump's 29%. Americans in general similarly agreed, though by slightly narrower difference, 58% to 34%.
However, Trump continues to maintain stability in his core base of supporters. Despite mounting investigations into the President's potential ties to Russia, 80% of Republicans approve of the job he's doing. He also maintains a 89% approval rating of those who voted for him in the last election.

There remain warning signs for the President, however. In the wake of the decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord and consistent military strikes against ISIS in Syria, more than half of respondents, 58%, think Trump has weakened the US's position abroad. Additionally, Americans are suspicious of their president -- more than six in 10 say they believe Trump has done something illegal or unethical in his financial dealings. Only 31% say they believe he's done nothing wrong in that regard.
This poll surveyed 1,205 adults by telephone between June 21 and 25. There is a ± 2.8 percentage points margin of error. A sub-sample of 995 registered voters were also surveyed, with a ± 3.1 percentage points margin of error.

Congressman Beto O'Rourke announced he will challenge Senator Ted Cruz for Senate in 2018 on Friday.

AUSTIN — U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke, the Democratic challenger to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, raised just more than $2 million between April and June, an amount likely to be one of the largest hauls by any Senate challenger in the reporting period that ends Saturday.
O’Rourke, D-Texas, is an underdog in the statewide race in the Republican-dominated state, but political experts say these fundraising numbers could give him a fighting chance against Cruz in 2018.
“If you’re Senator Cruz, you have to take O’Rourke’s candidacy seriously,"" said Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University. ""He’s a popular member of Congress and he’s raising enough money to run a professional campaign. That alone puts him head and shoulders above every other candidate who has even expressed an interest thus far in running a statewide race in 2018.”
More: Rep. Beto O'Rourke will challenge Ted Cruz for Senate in 2018
O'Rourke, 44, announced his fundraising total in an email and video to supporters Thursday morning.
He is in his third term in the U.S. House of Representatives. He officially launched his campaign for Cruz's seat at the end of March and remains the only Democrat in the running.
O’Rourke had $1.8 million in his campaign bank account at the end of June. Cruz hasn't disclosed his contributions for the most recent quarter, but he had $4.8 million on hand at the end of March.
U.S. Senate and House campaign finance reports from the second quarter of 2017 must be filed with the Federal Election Commission by Saturday.
Of the $2 million O’Rourke raised, 81% came from Texas, according to his campaign.

“It confirms that this is possible and that, I think, is an open question for a lot of people in Texas,” O’Rourke said in an interview with the USA TODAY Network. “Fortunately or unfortunately, what you raise and how many people contribute is an indicator of viability and I think this shows that we have a significant base of support from which to start, and we’re only three months in.""
Raising $2 million in a quarter this far from a Senate election is rare, especially for a non-incumbent, according to data from the FEC. Several incumbent senators up for re-election in 2018 have announced raising more money than O'Rourke between April and June, but O'Rourke's is the highest total announced so far for a non-incumbent. Many candidates have not yet said how much they brought in.

In the 2016 election, when 34 Senate seats were contested nationwide, only two non-incumbent Senate candidates in the country raised more than $2 million between April and June 2015, records show.
“I think that is a big enough number that it will demonstrate the credibility he needs to be able to show he can raise money but also run a grassroots campaign,” said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston. “I would say this makes him a credible challenger and I think that was still a question for a lot of people.”
Since the beginning of his campaign, O’Rourke pledged not to take money from political action committees. The $2 million he raised this quarter came from 46,574 individual contributors, who on average gave $44.40.
Jones said refusing PAC contributions gives O'Rourke an edge as a challenger in a tough campaign.
“The reality is that PACs aren’t going to be stumbling over themselves to give him money anyway, so it was a smart political move to take the high ground,"" Jones said.
Grassroots campaigns that rely on contributions from individual donors as opposed to big-dollar political groups can be a challenge to run, Rottinghaus said. He said efforts like O’Rourke’s depend on self-motivated individuals who are willing to seek out a candidate and donate.

“This campaign is sustainable for the right kind of candidate and I think he is that kind of candidate,” Rottinghaus said. “He has appeal to the base and I think Democrats are looking for someone they can invest in, and he is providing that opportunity. If the idealism that he has put out in the first months of his campaign hold up and more people learn about who he is and what he has done, there’s a good chance he can sustain that.”
O’Rourke still has a tough road ahead, Jones said. Texas has some of the most expensive television markets in the country and O’Rourke will be competing for national dollars with Democrats running for House and Senate seats in smaller states, where a donation can stretch a lot farther.

""While $2 million is a nice start, it still leaves quite a long way for Representative O'Rourke to go to amass a war chest to allow him to compete on anything close to an even playing field with Senator Cruz in the fall of 2018,"" Jones said
Cruz has remained fairly quiet about O’Rourke, although a fundraising email from his campaign earlier this year called the congressman an “unabashed liberal.”
Rottinghaus predicted that O’Rourke may raise more money than Cruz in the second quarter. He said that while Cruz can recover quickly, he should be careful not to take the race for granted.
“It’s not the $2 million the Cruz camp is going to be worried about,” Rottinghaus said. “Ted Cruz could pull that out the back pocket of his tailored suit, but it’s what it represents that’s the real potential scary figure.""

Trump signals he will work with Republican holdouts on health bill,"U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks as he hosts a Congressional picnic event, accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump, at the White House in Washington, U.S., June 22, 2017.
WASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump acknowledged that a lack of support from four Senate Republicans leaves the party's healthcare overhaul on a ""very, very narrow path"" to passage, but signaled a willingness to work with them to make changes.
""It's not that they're opposed. They'd like to get certain changes. And we'll see if we can take care of that,"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News that aired on Friday, calling the group of conservative lawmakers ""four very good people.""
Trump earlier indicated changes may be in store for the proposal unveiled by Senate Republicans on Thursday to replace former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. The plan would scale back aid to the poor and kill a tax on the wealthy.
""I am very supportive of the Senate #Healthcarebill. Look forward to making it really special!"" Trump wrote on Twitter on Thursday.
The Republican bill aims to deliver on one of Trump's central campaign promises to ""repeal and replace"" the 2010 law that expanded coverage to millions of Americans. Its fate remained uncertain since the four lawmakers' refusal to back the Senate draft would leave Republicans short of the votes to pass it.
Democrats are united in opposition to the proposal, which was worked out in secret by a group led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Republicans view Obama's Affordable Care Act as a costly government intrusion into the private marketplace.
The four holdouts, among the Senate's most conservative members, said the plan failed to rein in the federal government's role, highlighting Republicans' struggle to craft legislation to revamp a sector that accounts for one-sixth of the world's largest economy.
Rand Paul, who has rejected the plan along with fellow Republican Senators Ted Cruz, Mike Lee and Ron Johnson, said fundamental problems remained that would leave taxpayers subsidizing health insurance companies.
""I want the bill to look more like a repeal bill,"" Paul told MSNBC on Friday.
The S&P; 500 healthcare index .SPXHC dipped 0.3 percent at midday on Friday but was on track for a 3.4 percent gain for the week, its best week since November.
Other Republicans appeared more willing to embrace it.
Senator Bill Cassidy, who is still studying the proposal and has not yet decided how he will vote, said in several television interviews it was a good beginning.
""If the concerns that I have and the others have are addressed, I think it will pass,"" even if it takes longer than the Republican leaders' self-imposed deadline of July 4, he told Fox News.
The White House said it is hopeful a final bill will be finished before lawmakers leave Washington later this summer. Lawmakers are scheduled to break on July 28.
Spicer told Fox News on Friday he thought prospects of Senate passage were ""very high,"" adding: ""I think we're going to get this thing done ... and hopefully by the August recess really have Obamacare repealed and replaced.""
The Senate measure maintains much of the structure of a House bill passed in May but differs in several key ways. If it passes, it would have to be reconciled with the House version before Trump could sign it into law.
While Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House, the party's efforts to unwind Obamacare have been dogged by internal conflicts between moderate and hard-line members of the party.
Trump publicly celebrated the House bill's passage, only to later criticize it in private as ""mean."" This week he called for a health plan ""with heart.""
Democrats have sharply criticized both versions as a giveaway to the wealthy that would leave millions without health insurance.
On Thursday, Obama weighed in on Facebook, writing: ""If there’s a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family – this bill will do you harm.""
The Senate bill's real-world impact is still unknown, but the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is expected to provide an estimate early next week.
The CBO had found that the House bill would kick 23 million Americans off their health plans, making it unpopular with the public. Fewer than one in three Americans supports it, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling.

Imagine going to the ATM to get some cash, and hearing a faint voice from inside the machine.
Then, a note is passed through the receipt slot asking for help.
Has to be a joke, right?
About 2 p.m. Wednesday, a contractor got trapped inside a Corpus Christi Bank of America branch while changing a lock inside a room that connects to the drive-through ATM machine.
“He leaves his phone in his truck, he's installing a new lock on the door, and he gets locked inside the building where the ATM is,” said Corpus Christi Police Senior Officer Richard Olden to Corpus Christi television station KRIS.
Customers were using the machine to make withdrawals so he started slipping notes through the receipt slot saying, “Please Help. I'm stuck in here, and I don't have my phone. Please call my boss,” according to police.
One person took the pleas seriously and called authorities. But Olden told the Corpus Christi television station they intially thought it was a prank.
“We come out here, and sure enough we can hear a little voice coming from the machine. So we are thinking this is a joke. It's got to be a joke,” Olden said.
The contractor’s supervisor eventually showed up and police had to knock down a door to get the repairman out of the ATM room.
“Everyone is OK, but you will never see this in your life, that somebody was stuck in the ATM. It was just crazy,” Olden said.

July 17, 2017 9:00 PM
 
Republican Sens. Mike Lee and Jerry Moran said Monday evening they would not vote to advance the GOP healthcare bill, essentially killing the legislation in its current form.
Lee, of Utah, and Moran, of Kansas, tweeted that they could not support the Senate’s bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Without their support, the bill would not receive enough votes to pass a procedural hurdle and reach the floor for debate.
My colleague @JerryMoran and I will not support the MTP to this version of BCRA #HealthcareBill
— Mike Lee (@SenMikeLee) July 18, 2017
For the same reasons I could not support the previous version of this bill, I cannot support this one. #HealthcareBill
— Jerry Moran (@JerryMoran) July 18, 2017
Moran said in a statement that the Better Care Reconciliation Act, or BCRA as the Republican bill is being called, doesn’t address what he says are the fundamental issues with Obamacare.
“We should not put our stamp of approval on bad policy,” Moran said. “We must now start fresh with an open legislative process to develop innovative solutions that provide greater personal choice, protections for pre-existing conditions, increased access and lower overall costs for Kansans.”
Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky announced Sunday that the bill would be indefinitely delayed following news that Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., would remain at home recovering from surgery to remove a blood clot. McConnell had expected to vote on it this week and needed McCain’s vote.
Republicans need at least 50 votes — Vice President Mike Pence would break a tie — to pass their repeal and replace effort. But senators remain divided on the bill, with some saying it doesn’t do enough to roll back former President Barack Obama’s signature legislation, and others arguing it is too harsh and will kick their constituents off their current plans. Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky had already announced their opposition to the bill.
After its initial effort failed to garner enough votes, the House passed its repeal and replace effort in May. The Senate has also struggled to follow through on Republicans’ main campaign promise, with McConnell delaying a vote on the Senate version originally scheduled to take place before the July 4 congressional recess. Changes were made to that bill in attempt to get everyone in the party on board, but Lee’s and Moran’s announcements Monday demonstrate the difficulty in getting the entire Republican caucus to back the same bill.
Several other senators remain undecided. The Congressional Budget Office has yet to issue its score of the bill, which will determine how much it will cost and how it will impact the number of people currently insured under Obamacare.

The latest GOP effort to repeal and replace ""Obamacare"" was fatally wounded in the Senate Monday night when two more Republican senators announced their opposition to the legislation strongly backed by President Donald Trump.
The announcements from Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas left the Republican Party's long-promised efforts to get rid of President Barack Obama's health care legislation reeling. Next steps, if any, were not immediately clear.
Lee and Moran both said they could not support Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's legislation in its current form. They joined GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Rand Paul of Kentucky, both of whom announced their opposition right after McConnell released the bill last Thursday.
McConnell is now at least two votes short in the closely divided Senate and may have to go back to the drawing board or even begin to negotiate with Democrats, a prospect he's threatened but resisted so far. Or he could abandon the health care effort, which has proven more difficult than many Republicans envisioned after campaigning on the issue for years, and move on to tax legislation, a bigger Trump priority to begin with.
McConnell's bill ""fails to repeal the Affordable Care Act or address healthcare's rising costs. For the same reasons I could not support the previous version of this bill, I cannot support this one,"" said Moran.
Lee said, ""In addition to not repealing all of the Obamacare taxes, it doesn't go far enough in lowering premiums for middle class families; nor does it create enough free space from the most costly Obamacare regulations.""
It was the second straight failure for McConnell, who had to cancel a vote on an earlier version of the bill last month when defeat became inevitable.
Trump had kept his distance from the Senate process, but Monday night's development was a major blow for him, too, as the president failed to rally support for what has been the GOP's trademark issue for seven years — ever since Obama and the Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act. Republicans won the White House and full control of Congress in large part on the basis of their promises to repeal and replace ""Obamacare,"" but have struggled to overcome their deep internal divisions and deliver.
The Senate bill, like an earlier version that barely passed the House, eliminated mandates and taxes under Obamacare, and unraveled an expansion of the Medicaid health care program for the poor and disabled. But for conservatives like Lee and Paul it didn't go far enough in delivering on Republican Party promises to undo Obama's law, while moderates like Collins viewed the bill as too extreme in yanking insurance coverage from millions.
McConnell's latest version aimed to satisfy both camps, by incorporating language by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas allowing insurers to sell skimpy plans alongside more robust ones, and by adding billions to treat opioid addiction and to defray consumer costs.
But his efforts did not achieve the intended result.
There was no immediate reaction from McConnell's office. But Democrats could barely contain their glee.
""This second failure of Trumpcare is proof positive that the core of this bill is unworkable,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. ""Rather than repeating the same failed, partisan process yet again, Republicans should start from scratch and work with Democrats on a bill that lowers premiums, provides long term stability to the markets and improves our health care system.""
Prior to the stunning announcements from Lee and Moran, the GOP bill stood on the knife's edge, with zero votes to spare but not dead yet. It was apparent that no GOP senator wanted to be the third to announce opposition and become responsible for killing the bill, so the news from Lee and Moran came simultaneously.
It arrived as about a half-dozen senators were at the White House meeting with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence about the next steps in the GOP effort to ensure passage of the bill.
There are at least a half-dozen or so others who are undecided, so it's quite likely that more ""no"" votes will be announced in the hours and days ahead.
In a Senate divided 52-48 between Republicans and Democrats, McConnell could lose only two senators and still prevail on a procedural vote to open debate on the bill. He had hoped to hold that vote this week, but Sen. John McCain's recovery following surgery in Arizona had already pushed back that timeframe.
Earlier this month, Moran faced tough questions from constituents at a town hall in tiny Palco, Kansas, about the impact of the GOP bill. About 150 people tried to squeeze into a community center room and many applauded his opposition to the initial health care bill. The session underscored the evolving position of many Americans to government-run health care, with loud approval for programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
""I will choose country over party,"" Moran told the town hall. ""I will choose Kansans over party.""

Al Sharpton Calls On ‘Christian Right’ To Demand Federal Oversight Of Chicago Cops,"Anders Hagstrom on July 14, 2017
Rev. Al Sharpton called for America’s ministers to demand Department of Justice oversight of the Chicago Police Department on Thursday.
Sharpton claimed that many of the city’s police officers are corrupt, citing the alleged coverup of the 2014 shooting of Laquan McDonald. He asked other ministers to march with him against Attorney General Jeff Sessions, saying “it’s time for the Christian Right to face the right Christians,” CBS Chicago reported.
“You cannot have it both ways. You must fight criminal behavior whether the criminal has on blue jeans or a blue uniform,” he told CBS. “A criminal is a criminal and ought to be treated like that.”
Sharpton claimed he knew how to handle the Trump administration, due to his time combating President Donald Trump in New York City, the Chicago Tribune reported.
“I’ve known him for 35 years,” Sharpton said while speaking at a church. “If you can meet with the Russians, you can meet with the leaders in Chicago!”
Sharpton hopes to gather 1,000 ministers to march in Washington, D.C. next month on the anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech, and several Chicago ministers have already pledged to join him.
“Dr. King taught us we must speak truth to power, and it doesn’t matter who is in power,” Rev. Ira Acree of St. John Bible Church told CBS.
“Chicago was on its way to police reform until the Trump administration brought in Jeff Sessions as the attorney general of this nation,” said Pastor Cy Fields of New Landmark Baptist Church.
Current and former members of the Chicago Police Department were indicted in June on multiple charges of attempting to cover up the actions of Officer Jason Van Dyke, who shot Laquan McDonald. The city is now also facing a lawsuit demanding that Chicago pass police reforms.

Trump Just Went On Another Twitter Rant; Accuses Obama Of Obstruction Of Justice (TWEETS),"GooglePinterestDiggLinkedin Reddit Stumbleupon PrintDeliciousPocketTumblr
Twitter Fingers aka Donald Trump just jumped on Twitter to throw former President Barack Obama’s name on his own crimes.
Subscribe to our Youtube Channel
Trump, who is known to hold his press conferences through Tweets, accused Obama of obstruction of justice as it relates to the 2016 election scandal involving Russia. The president said that the only reason that Obama did ‘nothing’ when he found out about the Russians meddling with the election is that he expected a win for Hillary. He tweeted out:
The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2017
…and did not want to “rock the boat.” He didn’t “choke,” he colluded or obstructed, and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2017
Yep, you read that correctly. The very thing that Trump is being investigated for, he wants to pin on Obama. It didn’t stop at that tweet though. The president continued to try and get a rise out of Obama (which we all know isn’t going to happen). Last week, news broke that President Obama knew about the Russians interference ‘long before’ the election but was slow to move. Trump couldn’t wait to use this information as leverage to potentially get out of his own mess. Trump is now demanding an apology.
The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia…
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2017
..under a magnifying glass, they have zero “tapes” of T people colluding. There is no collusion & no obstruction. I should be given apology!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2017
Obama was trying to finish his last term in peace. He did such a great change in the White House and Trump’s little racist and ungrateful minions still wouldn’t give him the thanks he was due. So in the mess that was created by Trump, Obama left Trump to be a grown man and clean that up himself. WHAT THE F**K does he have to do with the fact that Trump got the Russians to interfere in the elections? Not a damn thing! So, Obama, continue to live your unbothered life outside of the White House. Trump is drowning himself. The truth will be out soon.

U.S. Navy: Wind Farms Hurt Military Readiness,"The Department of Defense recently performed a study that found that large wind farms have a real and negative impact of radar effectiveness.
The Daily Caller was able to get a letter addressed to Texas Senator John Cornyn sent from Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy James Balocki. While the study itself has not been released the letter outlines the findings well.
The general conclusion of the study confirmed that primary radar detection may be significantly degraded in airspace immediately above wind farms and in some cases beyond the wind farm. When flying in such areas of degraded primary radar coverage, there is increased risk to Navy pilots from civilian aircraft operating without active transponders.
The presence of wind farms near radar sites can actually threaten the lives of our military pilots.
There has been a push towards greener energy in the US and in the military specifically, especially under President Obama. This led to an increase in wind farms, at the expense of military preparedness.
The US military has expressed concern over wind farms before. Amazon attempted to put up a wind farm in North Carolina near one of the Navy’s Relocatable Over-The-Horizon Radar (ROTHR) sites. These sites provide radar coverage over the Atlantic Ocean for the Navy.
The Department of Defense eventually overruled the Navy’s objections in 2014 citing the need for more green energy production. Both the Navy and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have done studies on the effect of the wind farm on the radar site and found it likely they would hamper the site’s effectiveness.
Luckily, the North Carolina congress passed a two-year ban on the wind turbines recently.
President Trump’s dedication to the military will help improve effectiveness despite this set back. It’s only a matter of time until this push towards ineffective and dangerous technologies is reversed.",DC Statesman,1
God Can’t Paint With His Right Hand,"Everyone knows God’s power is infinite. But one little boy thinks he can’t paint with his Right hand. Wait until you hear the reason why!
 
Little Bobby was spending the weekend with his grandmother.
His grandmother decided to take him to the park on Saturday morning.
It had been snowing all night and everything was beautiful.
His grandmother remarked… “doesn’t it look like an artist painted this scenery? Did you know God painted this just for you?”
Bobby said, “Yes, God did it and he did it left handed.”
This confused his grandmother a bit, and she asked him “What makes you say God did this with his left hand?”
“Well,” said Bobby, “we learned at Sunday School last week that Jesus sits on God’s right hand!”
Bobby is one smart little boy!

Missing Venezuelan chopper pilot in grenade attack reappears,"Caracas – A Venezuelan helicopter pilot who vanished after dropping grenades on the Supreme Court in what the government slammed as an attempted coup reappeared in a video posted online late Tuesday.
In the clip, Oscar Perez urged Venezuelans to “stand firm in the streets” in their protests against socialist President Nicolas Maduro.
“The moment is now, not tomorrow. The moment to wake up is now,” the 36 year-old elite cop said, speaking in front of a Venezuelan flag. “Let’s stand firm in the streets.”
On June 27 Perez and unidentified accomplices flew over Caracas in a police helicopter and dropped four grenades on the Supreme Court before opening fire on the interior ministry.There were no casualties.
Perez appeared in a video released online around the time of the attacks flanked by four masked figures in black — two of them holding rifles — calling for an uprising.
He claimed to belong to a group that included military members, police and public servants opposed to the “criminal government.” Maduro branded the action a “terrorist attack,” part of an “escalation” by right-wing “coup” plotters. He put the military on alert in response.

n"">Five people have been stricken with the rare, rodent-borne hantavirus illness in Washington state since February, three of whom have died, in the state's worst outbreak of the disease in at least 18 years, public health officials reported on Thursday.
The three fatal cases also mark the highest death toll from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Washington state during a single year since the respiratory ailment was first identified in the ""Four Corners"" region of the U.S. Southwest in 1993.
The disease has been found to be transmitted to humans from deer mice, either through contact with urine, droppings, saliva or nesting materials of infected rodents or by inhaling dust contaminated with the virus.
Victims in the latest outbreak were men and women ranging in age from their 20s to their 50s from four counties across the state, said David Johnson, spokesman for the Washington State Department of Health.
The first diagnosed case this year was in February and the most recent was last month, when the infection killed a resident of Spokane County in the eastern part of the state near Washington's border with Idaho. Three of the five cases, including another one that proved fatal, were confirmed in the Puget Sound region of King and Skagit counties.
The only common factor among those infected by the disease, which typically kills more than a third of its victims, is that they were all exposed to infected mice, Johnson said.
The last time five confirmed hantavirus cases were diagnosed in Washington state in a single year was in 1999, although just one of those proved fatal, Johnson said.
Washington has reported 49 of the 690 hantavirus cases tallied nationwide from 1993 to January 2016, ranking fifth among 10 Western states that account for the bulk of all documented infections, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.
Eighteen infections with four deaths were reported nationally in 2015. The year before, the CDC counted 35 cases, of which 14 were fatal.
The most highly publicized hantavirus outbreak occurred in 2012, when 10 visitors to Yosemite National Park in California were diagnosed with the infection, three of whom died, prompting a worldwide alert. All but one of those were linked to tent cabins later found to have been infested by deer mice.

Trump family became increasingly disappointed in Reince Priebus: Report,"| Jul 28, 2017, 9:12 PMShare on TwitterShare on FacebookEmail this articleShare on LinkedIn

President Trump and his family had increasingly become fed up with Reince Priebus as chief of staff for weeks before Trump announced his ouster on Friday by tweeting Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly would take his place.
Trump's wife Melania, daughter Ivanka Trump, and son-in-law Jared Kusher all thought Priebus had been doing a poor job. Kusher and Ivanka Trump both work for the president as top advisers.
Trump himself had been going around saying that Priebus was ""weak,"" an unnamed senior White House official told the Washington Post.
""It reached a fever pitch of the president complaining about Reince to all of us,"" the official said. ""If we heard it once, we heard it 20 times in the last week — this erosion of confidence. The word was 'weak' — 'weak,' 'weak,' 'weak.' 'Can't get it done.'""
It has been rumored for months that Priebus would be ousted from the White House, and speculation heated up with Trump's decision to tap Anthony Scaramucci as his communications director. Scaramucci reportedly has had a behind-the-scenes feud with Priebus, who had worked to block Scaramucci from obtaining a White House job. This week Scaramucci said Priebus would be asked to resign after accusing him of leaking.
After he announced Kelly as his new chief of staff, Trump publicly praised Priebus on Twitter.
""I would like to thank Reince Priebus for his service and dedication to his country,"" Trump said. ""We accomplished a lot together and I am proud of him!""
Priebus, in a Friday evening interview on CNN, said he and Trump had an agreement that ""anytime either one of us thinks that we need to make a change or move in a different direction, let's just talk about it and get it done.""
The Post report also said that Trump has been repeatedly asking Kelly, a retired Marine general, to be his chief of staff since mid-May. Kelly initially declined, saying that he still had national security and immigration enforcement work to do as DHS head.

Mayawati’s resignation: Mixed response among different political parties,"Mayawati’s votebase has seen a massive erosion, which has apparently upset her,” Apna Dal (S) spokesperson Arvind Sharma said. (PTI)
The resignation of BSP chief Mayawati from Rajya Sabha has evoked mixed response from different political parties in UP, with BJP terming it as a “political stunt” while Congress and Samajwadi Party held the Centre’s attitude responsible for her abrupt decision. “BSP supremo Mayawati is unable to digest the results of 2014 Lok Sabha elections and 2017 UP Assembly elections. People of UP have grossly rejected partisan and communal politics. They are looking forward to progress and development of the state,” UP BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi said.He described her resignation as “political stunt and emotional drama”.
Apna Dal (Sonelal), an ally of BJP-led NDA, attributed her decision to “massive erosion” in her support base. “BSP chief Mayawati is feeling threatened by the rise of Anupriya Patel, whom the backwards and Dalits are looking up as their leader. Mayawati’s votebase has seen a massive erosion, which has apparently upset her,” Apna Dal (S) spokesperson Arvind Sharma said.
Anupriya, a senior party leader, is a Union minister and represents Mirzapur in Lok Sabha. The Congress said that the Dalit leader took the sudden decision to quit Rajya Sabha as the BJP had unleashed “autocratic rule” throughout the country. UP Congress spokesperson Ashok Singh alleged that ever since the BJP governmet came to power in the state, there has been an increase in crime and atrocities against Dalits. “Mayawati had to tender resignation only to attract the attention of the government, which is working against the interest of Dalits in the state. If Mayawati wanted to say something about Saharanpur incident, she should have been allowed,” Singh said. Chief spokesperson of Samajwadi Party, an ally of Congress in the state, Rajendra Chaudhary alleged that Mayawati’s right to speech and expression was violated in the Rajya Sabha.
President of Rashtriya Kisan Manch, a local outfit, Shekhar Dixit too backed Mayawati, saying her step was “right”. “Mayawati took the right step as she was not allowed to speak and present her point of view,” he said. Mayawati’s resignation from the Rajya Sabha was accepted today by Chairman Hamid Ansari.
The BSP supremo had resigned from the House in a huff yesterday, accusing the BJP and the Chair of not allowing her to raise the issue of anti-Dalit violence in Uttar Pradesh in the Parliament.",Financial Express,0

More than 100 villagers were feared buried Saturday in a massive landslide triggered by heavy rain in Sichuan Province in southwestern China, according to local officials and the Chinese media.
Fifteen bodies had been found by late Saturday, the China Global Television Network reported. It said 118 people in the village of Xinmo in Mao County were missing and 62 homes had been crushed beneath huge boulders and a mass of earthen debris.
Rescuers were using heavy equipment and life-detection equipment in hopes of finding some people still alive under the tons of rock.
The Sichuan Daily said rescuers made contact with one villager buried under the rubble who answered her cellphone when they called and burst into tears. The woman was in the bedroom of her home when the landslide hit the village, and rescuers were trying to reach her, the report said.
The paper said a family of three, including a month-old baby, managed to escape just as the landslide hit their house around 6 a.m.

Qiao Dashuai told state broadcaster CCTV that the baby saved the family because he was woken up by the child’s crying and was going to change the baby’s diaper when he heard a noise that alerted him to the landslide.
“We heard a strange noise at the back of our house, and it was rather loud,” Qiao said. “Wind was coming into the room so I wanted to close the door. When we came out, water flow swept us away instantly.” He said they struggled against the flood of water until they met medical workers who took them to a hospital. Qiao said his parents and other relatives had not been found.
Wang Yongbo, a local rescue official, told CCTV that some 105 million cubic feet of earth and rock — equivalent to more than 1,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools — had slid down the mountain, the Associated Press reports.
Authorities said the upper section of a nearby mountain collapsed due to heavy rain, hurling rocks into the valley. A sea of boulders and mud covered almost a mile of road and blocked over a mile section of a river.
Almost 3,000 firefighters, medical staff and armed police officers were rushed to the scene, CGNT reported, but meteorologists said the rescue effort could be hampered by the prospect of three more days of rain.
Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday ordered all-out rescue efforts for anyone trapped in the rubble, the state-owned Xinhua news agency reported.

There were huge celebrations in the Iraqi capital Baghdad on Monday evening after Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared victory over the Islamic State group in Mosul. (July 10)

MOSUL, Iraq — The massive effort to drive the Islamic State from what had been Iraq's second-largest city is now being matched by an enormous challenge to bring an ancient metropolis back to life from near total ruin.
Much of the historic Old City in western Mosul has been reduced to rubble, with corpses rotting on the streets or buried under debris. Unexploded bombs and booby traps litter the terrain, as Islamic State guerrillas continue sniper attacks. And hundreds of thousands of former residents who fled remain in limbo.
Rebuilding after the nine-month offensive that ended in July will take years and billions of dollars, but the priority now is to make the city safe enough for residents to return. That means hunting down Islamic State stragglers, removing thousands of bodies and locating all the bombs that could still go off.
""It's very hard for us,"" said civil defense Col. Zacharia Ahmed Hassan, who heads a 19-man crew working 10 to 12 hours a day in 118-degree heat to recover bodies in western Mosul. ""It's very hot, and we have to get up at 6:30. But we have to do our jobs.""
Damage is far more extensive in western Mosul, where the prolonged fighting and airstrikes were more fierce. In contrast, reconstruction in Mosul's eastern half across the Tigris River has been ongoing since January. A large proportion of buildings there remained intact.
Six images tell story of Mosul's destruction
""Some facilities have been damaged, but electricity, water and markets have all come back"" in eastern Mosul, said Saeed al-Jayashi, a spokesman for the Iraqi military, during a recent visit to Washington, D.C. ""Even university students were back at school, defending their dissertations.""
Hassan said his team works without body armor, making them easy targets for any remaining sleeper cells of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.

Brig. Gen. Saad Maan, in a recent speech to the U.S. Defense Department, said ISIS fighters continue ""to have attacks against civilians out of desperation,"" though they don't hold any territory any more.
Being around so much death takes a toll. Hassan said his most difficult moment was recovering the bodies of five of his relatives from a collapsed building a month ago.
""It's a bad memory,"" he said. ""The youngest two of them were medical students.""
Some of the remains belong to ISIS fighters, but a majority of the bodies are civilians. The team points out that those killed deserve proper burial, but the bodies also pose a public health risk of spreading potential disease if left on the ground.
Many civilians were shot in the streets by ISIS fighters while attempting to flee, although most were buried under collapsed buildings, largely as a result of airstrikes and other explosions, Hassan said.
More than a dozen civilians previously told USA TODAY they lost relatives in airstrikes by a U.S.-led coalition that leveled buildings with scores of people inside. ISIS often used civilians as ""human shields"" during fighting and airstrikes.
With so many bodies underneath rubble, extracting them requires much work, although the civil defense team has few vehicles and only basic shovels and pickaxes.
""Many of the civil defense tools were destroyed in the occupation and the fighting,"" Hassan said. ""We don't have the tools we need to help us with the bodies. They sent us a team from Baghdad and some trucks, but they are damaged.""
Some team members use their own trucks, and sometimes a private citizen will loan the crew a bulldozer.
The difficult task is further complicated by the presence of many anxious residents, begging the team to help identify their loved ones. ""People come to us all the time, shouting and crying,"" Hassan said. ""We understand them.""
In one day, the team picks up 20 to 50 bodies, which are taken to the closest hospital for identification. While the work is challenging, there are pleasant surprises.
""Seven days ago, we found 23 people who were still alive. We took them from their graves, under the rubble, and took them to the hospital — men, women and children. They were very weak, hungry and sick, but alive,"" Hassan said.
The job is dangerous in another way — no protection from the myriad explosive devices. When an bomb is spotted, civil defense calls in the Federal Police's Emergency Response Division to dispose of it.
Most of the bombs are unexploded mortar and rocket-propelled grenades, as well as bombs — between 500 and 2,000 pounds — that were dropped from planes, according to the civil defense and Federal Police. Only a fraction are Improvised Explosive Devices or booby traps set up by ISIS.
Once the explosives are removed, they are handed to the Iraqi army for safe disposal.
""The situation in Mosul is dangerous, especially on the west side,"" said Col. Taha Zebari of the Emergency Response Division.
It's hard to know how many explosives remain after five months of intense fighting in western Mosul.
Zebari said that while his team has not had any losses from the explosives, the job is still difficult because of few funds.
""My team members are missing fuel and transportation,"" he said. ""Only three members of the team are taking money from the government,"" with the rest contributing money out of their pockets for equipment.

Sweet 5-year-old Red Sox fan with big dreams dies after visit from the team,"July 25, 2017 | BizPac Review | Print Article
A sweet little boy with big dreams made an even bigger impact in his short life.
Five-year-old Ari “Danger” Schultz was born with critical aortic stenosis and evolving hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the New York Post reported.
Little Ari’s condition kept him in and out of hospitals for much of his life, but it didn’t dampen his dreams.
Ari “Danger” Schultz finding out he’s getting a new heart. Video screengrab.
Ari won the hearts of legions of fans with his love of the Boston Red Sox. Video of him receiving the news that he would be receiving a long-awaited heart transplant went viral. The whole time he was hearing the news, Ari was swinging his bat while wearing his Red Sox jersey.
Understandably nervous about the upcoming surgery, Ari’s dad told him they might be able to go to a Red Sox game in the near future if he got his new heart.
Ari was released from the hospital on June 16th and received a special visit from Red Sox catcher Christian Vasquez and his favorite player Xander Bogaerts at his home, the Post reported. Ari was even invited to throw the first pitch at Fenway Park on August 27th.
Tragically, Ari “Danger” Schultz passed away on July 21st after suffering a seizure. A post on his Facebook page stated:
“Ari passed away peacefully this evening listening to the Red Sox.”
Peacefully and triumphantly, as the little boy lived bravely and latched on to his dreams which were already coming true.
And of course, he passed on with lots of love – including from his beloved Red Sox.
Some fans make an instant impact on our team. Ari Schultz, with his optimism & unbridled excitement, is at the top. We'll miss you, Ari. pic.twitter.com/MIQrbE7ZZ7

Iraq military says it has retaken iconic Mosul mosque,"Baghdad – The Iraqi military announced on Thursday that special forces had recaptured the iconic Mosul mosque where jihadist chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi made his only known public appearance.
A top special forces commander told AFP that while the Nuri mosque — which was blown up by the Islamic State group last week — was close to being recaptured, it had not been retaken yet.
“Counter-Terrorism Service forces control the Nuri mosque and Al-Hadba (minaret),” the Joint Operations Command said in a statement.
But Staff Lieutenant General Abdulwahab al-Saadi said that while Iraqi forces were close to retaking the mosque, they were still some 20 metres (yards) away.
The mosque and its famed Al-Hadba (hunchback) leaning minaret were Mosul landmarks and also held major significance in the history of IS rule in Iraq.

Venezuela's 'tiger' foreign minister Rodriguez quits,"Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez arrives to deliver a news conference on the sidelines of the Organization of American States (OAS) 47th General Assembly in Cancun, Mexico June 20, 2017.
CARACAS Venezuela's Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez left her post on Wednesday to run for a seat in a controversial new congress, drawing praise from her boss as a ""tiger"" for her feisty defense of the socialist government.
Historian and deputy foreign minister Samuel Moncada will replace her, President Nicolas Maduro said, announcing the diplomatic shake-up in a speech on state TV.
""She truly deserves the recognition of the entire country because she has defended Venezuelan sovereignty, peace and independence like a tiger,"" Maduro said of Rodriguez, who had been Venezuela's top diplomat since the end of 2014.
""Congratulations comrade! Job well done.""
Like some other senior Maduro allies, Rodriguez will now be running for a seat in a new Constituent Assembly in an election set for July 30.
Venezuela's opposition is boycotting the vote, saying it is rigged in Maduro's favor and intended purely to keep the ruling Socialist Party in power despite its current unpopularity.
The president says the new assembly, a super body with powers to rewrite the constitution and override other institutions, is necessary to bring peace after nearly three months of anti-government unrest that have killed 75 people.
Outgoing foreign minister Rodriguez has been a diehard envoy for Maduro, even trying to crash a meeting of regional bloc Mercosur after Venezuela's suspension and lambasting critics of her government in often colorful language.

First Muslim Police In Minnesota Murders Blonde Girl For ***,"Less than a week ago, an innocent yoga instructor was murdered in cold blood. The story of her tragic death highlights some major issues in this country.
The murder reportedly took place in a back alley. Justine Damond didn’t stand a chance against the brutality she was about to face for no reason other than being a good Samaritan.
On the night of her murder, Damond called 911. She was frightened that a man had accosted someone behind her home. When a police car pulled up to her house, she walked outside in her pajamas, desperate to speak with authorities.
As she was walking up to the police car to fill them in about the potential crime, Officer Mohamed Noor pulled out his gun and shot her dead. Later, Noor claimed he was “spooked”—despite the fact that his partner was in the car and she was in her pajamas. Many are demanding Noor be charged with murder, saying headlines would look very different if the tables were turned.
“If a blonde cop killed a Muslim, we would all be raked over the coals,” Pamela Geller wrote. “There would be marches and calls for sharia legislation and god knows what.”

When you’re supposed to be working for the people of the United States, however, and be a representative figure for all Americans, you should probably be mindful of what you’re wearing as to not appear ostentatious.
Melania Trump didn’t get the memo.
While greeting India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House, Melania decided to wear a gorgeous yellow Emilio Pucci dress.
And she’s beautiful in that dress. However, want to know how much that dress cost?
That’s right. More than many citizens in the United States make in a month.
Now, did Michelle Obama wear designer gowns? Sure she did. She often wore various designers at different big events. But we also saw Michelle in Banana Republic outfits, J Crew, and shopping at Target. She definitely came off far more as a woman of the people.
Nonetheless, that’s a lot of money Melania spent on a dress to wear at home on a Monday. Sure, she was meeting a foreign leader, but still. C’mon now. But to her credit, she does look amazing in it.

Exclusive: on the front lines inside the old city of Raqqa
Exclusive: on the front lines inside the old city of Raqqa 03:06
(CNN)A week after Iraq's Prime Minister Haider Al Abadi declared victory over ISIS in Mosul, Iraqi troops are continuing to clear the country's second biggest city of remaining fighters but US and coalition officials are already focusing on the next objectives in the campaign to defeat the terror group.
The next major prize being eyed by the coalition is the Syrian city of Raqqa, the would-be caliphate's one-time ""capital."" Lt. Gen. Townsend told CNN last week that following the capture of Mosul, Raqqa was ""now job number one.""
Speaking to reporters on Monday Pentagon spokesman US Navy Capt. Jeff Davis called Syria ""our biggest focus of effort.""
The US and its coalition allies are using artillery and airstrikes to back the Syrian Democratic Forces, a mix of Arab and Kurdish fighters, in their assault on Raqqa.
There are about 55,000 SDF fighters, made up of 31,000 Kurds and 24,000 Arabs, but the coalition says it will primarily be Arab fighters that take part in the battle for Raqqa.
ISIS brides flee caliphate as noose tightens on terror group
The US-led coalition has trained some 8,000 SDF fighters and US military advisers have accompanied SDF units as they have pushed into the inner areas of Raqqa.
But despite some rapid initial progress, coalition officials have said that the SDF has encountered tougher resistance in recent days.
""The SDF have incurred casualties as they have met some stiffening resistance from ISIS as they move closer into the city center,"" US Army Col. Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for the coalition, told reporters last week.
Davis said ISIS was mounting a robust defense, using improvised explosive devices, car bombs and drones, but added that the terror group was ""struggling to counter the SDF's multiples avenues of advance.""
Some reports had suggested that the SDF had paused its push on Raqqa because of casualties. However coalition officials said that this was not in fact the case, with Davis noting the group had gained territory from ISIS over the last 24 hours.
The coalition estimates that the ranks of ISIS fighters in Raqqa has been reduced from 2,500 to 2,000 since the assault began about 40 days ago.
The coalition is also training a ""hold-force"" to secure Raqqa after ISIS is ejected from the city. A US defense official told CNN that some 250 members of this force had been trained and the goal is that number will reach 3,000.
""Much work remains to be done in Iraq even after the liberation of Mosul,"" Davis told reporters Monday.
He called Tal Afar, Hawija and the town of Al Qaim in the Middle Euphrates River valley ""the three large areas that I would say are still on the to-do list""
The ISIS-held town of Tal Afar is only about 50 miles west of Mosul and Davis said that Iraq's 15th Armored Division is already making preparations to advance on the city.
The coalition estimates that there are about 700 ISIS fighters in Tal Afar.
Is ISIS leader Baghdadi dead or alive? Nobody knows
""The coalition continues to support the (Iraqi Security Forces) as they carry out detailed clearance operations in Mosul and prepare for follow on operations in Tal Afar,"" Davis said while adding that there was still significant work to do in Mosul.
Davis said that Iraqi soldiers, counterterrorism units and federal police were still performing ""detailed clearance operations"" of tunnels and caves in Mosul and were ""on the lookout for ISIS fighters that are hiding and working to identify explosive devices that could threaten friendly forces and civilians.""
Iraqi officials have expressed confidence that they have enough personnel to clear ISIS from Tal Afar and elsewhere in Iraq.
""We have enough forces to liberate what is remaining,"" Iraq's military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Brigadier Yahya Rasool told reporters at the Pentagon last week.
Al Qaim and Hawija
""There are enemy enclaves in Hawija, enemy enclaves in western Anbar. The Iraqi Security Forces and the coalition have a plan to get after them and we will move with all due speed to do that,"" Townsend told reporters last week.
Al Qaim is a town in western Anbar province on the Iraq-Syria border that sits along the Euphrates River Valley. It is connected to a swath of territory that ISIS controls in Syria.
The coalition believes that ISIS has about 1,000 fighters in Al Qaim.
In the heart of Raqqa, the impact of ISIS is all around
Hawijeh is close to the city of Kirkuk, an area currently controlled by US-backed Kurdish Peshmerga forces.
Coalition officials believe that the fewer than 1,000 ISIS fighters left in Hawija are largely isolated.
ISIS is ""largely contained in Hawija,"" Townsend said, adding that they were ""contained to the east by the Kurdish defensive line, and contained to the west by an Iraqi defensive line.""
Middle Euphrates River Valley, Syria
Perhaps the most challenging ISIS target will be in the Syrian section of the Middle Euphrates River Valley.
US defense officials have said that they have observed top ISIS officials increasingly abandoning Raqqa for towns and cities further south along the Euphrates River, such as Mayadin and Deir-e-Zor.
The coalition has been conducting numerous airstrikes in the area, killing several ISIS leaders.
Dillon said ""the majority"" of airstrikes targeting senior ISIS leaders were taking place in that area.
""We do continue to strike the middle Euphrates River Valley and those are deliberate strikes, there's not full-on combat operations going on there,"" Dillon said.
There are some pro-regime forces fighting ISIS in the area near Deir-e-Zoir but the thousands of ISIS fighters in that area are relatively far from any coalition-backed forces at this point in time, casting doubt on when an offensive could take place there.

China Says Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong Is Void,"Leaders of China and Britain stand to attention following the hoisting of the flags at the handover ceremony in Hong Kong minutes after midnight of July 1, 1997.
 
On the Hong Kong handover 20th anniversary, China’s Foreign Ministry says the document is no longer legally binding.
China will celebrate the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong’s handover on July 1, and Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived Hong Kong on June 29 to join the festivities. As the big day approached, the Chinese Foreign Ministry delivered the Hong Kong people (as well as those on the Chinese mainland) a hard blow by denying the validity of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong, the fundamental document that led to the peaceful handover 20 years ago.
On June 30, at a regular briefing, when commenting on Britain’s role in today’s Hong Kong, Lu Kang, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said:
I would like to emphasize that Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China and Hong Kong’s affair is China’s internal affairs… Now that Hong Kong has returned to its motherland for 20 years, the Sino-British Joint Declaration, as a historical document, no longer has any practical significance, and does not have any binding effect on the Chinese central government’s management of the Hong Kong. The British side has no sovereignty over Hong Kong after the handover, nor power to rule or power to supervise. [We] hope that people could understand the reality.

In addition to defending Hong Kong’s current situation, Lu also warned others not to criticize:
The question of whether Hong Kong is a success or not has been proved by the 20-year practice of Hong Kong’s return to the motherland. It is not for any outsider to make improper comments.
He then quoted some data to demonstrate that Hong Kong’s economy remains strong and competitive under China’s rule. So “Hong Kong’s ‘One country, Two systems’ practice is successful… the Hong Kong people are content and the mainland people are happy,” Lu concluded.
Regarding the stark statement, the British Foreign Office spokeswoman replied: “The Sino-British Joint Declaration remains as valid today as it did when it was signed over 30 years ago.” According to Reuters, the spokeswoman further emphasized: “It is a legally binding treaty, registered with the UN and continues to be in force. As a co-signatory, the U.K. government is committed to monitoring its implementation closely.”
The majority of the mainland Chinese netizens were appalled by Lu’s reply as well. Despite China’s extremely harsh censorship, within hours, more than 7,000 people had commented on the report of Lu’s statement posted on Weibo (Chinese equivalent of Twitter) and most criticized him sharply.
One Chinese netizen commented: “The Chinese Constitution is also a historical document; Perhaps in your view, it does not have any practical significance either.” The comment won more than 6,000 thumbs-up. Another simple comment — “shameful” — won more than 3,000 thumbs-up.

Obama Will NOT Like What This Brave Marine Said About His “Legacy”,"When President Barack Obama took the stage in a farewell speech that summed up his Presidency, to a crowd of die-hard liberals, one marine known only as “J” wasn’t convinced.
J contacted us to publish his response to Obama’s farewell speech, and essentially his entire Presidency. We can’t agree more. Here is the letter in its entirety.
This Is Your Legacy
“For the first time, I can say that I’m proud of my country.” No, these aren’t my words, they’re the words of your wife when you took office in 2009. This set the tone for the kind of President you’d be, and the kind of legacy you left behind.
Your speech to your adoring fans screaming “Four more years!” makes for a good sound bite and video clip, but it doesn’t paint the picture of the tens of millions of regular Americans that voted you in twice and gotten stabbed in the back for it.
You stood in front of hundreds of veterans and promised that their lives would be better after you took office, that they would get the care that their country owed them. Eight years later, the VA is more broken than ever and my brothers and sisters in arms are committing suicide at an all time high. You ignored the advice of wartime Generals and pulled troops out of an unstable country and gave rise to ISIS, the most evil group of people on the planet. This is your legacy.
Our country is twice as much in debt as it was when you took office, to the tune of nearly $20 trillion. That number is so large that is may as well be monopoly money, and the only people that are footing the bill are our children, the ones that you cut off at the knees by taking millions in “donations” from bloated teachers’ unions. You know, the ones who hire teachers who can’t teach and can’t be fired. This is your legacy.
You said that America became stronger, but all you did was apologize to corrupt world leaders and made deals with radical Muslims who want us and our allies in Israel to be wiped off the map. You downplayed terrorist attacks as workplace violence, and used national tragedies to trample on the second amendment rights of law abiding citizens. You legitimized the hateful Black Lives Matter movement and gave them the ability to poison the minds of our inner city youth, then stood on the graves on the officers that lost their lives as a result and had the audacity to lecture grieving police officers about race relations. This is your legacy.
You said middle America clings to God and guns, while you waged war on both. You tried to pass yourself off as a Christian, while telling radical Muslim nations that practice Sharia Law that you stand with them. This is your legacy.
You spoke about Obamacare being a force for good, but don’t have the common sense to realize that holding a gun to the heads of people who work for a living, to pay for the ones that don’t, makes everyone worse off. Making it illegal for people not to have coverage is exactly the kind of socialism that conservatives warned about before you got into office. You dismissed these claims as conspiracy theories, but now we have regular, healthy families having to pay tens of thousands of dollars for the bare minimum of healthcare. This is your legacy.
Before you were elected, you made the case that the first black President would be a milestone for this country. Eight years later, you’re standing on the podium, saying “Yes, We Did,” like you’ve accomplished something other than playing a record amount of golf as the country gets ready for its second great recession. This is your legacy.
What may come as a surprise to you and the rest of the now far-left pundits that run the media is, the color of your skin never mattered to America. It was the policies that attracted Americans, the decency and unity that you said you’d restore to this nation, and it was the betrayal of these ideas which gave us an actual outsider, and the person that you failed to stop, Donald Trump.
Your Presidency was a wake-up call for America. You said that you’re now motivated to chime in about our political system as a citizen, but I’m here to tell you, as someone who loves this country and will fight to the death to protect the Constitution that you referred to as “just a piece of parchment,” that America has awakened to your self-serving ideology and they’ve had enough of you.
In ten days, a new President will take up residence in the White House and your eight years of unconstitutional executive orders that sets violent criminals free, disastrous economic policies, and weak foreign policies will be erased.
You will be the President that will be remembered by those too young to know any better, not as a champion and protector of our rights and Constitution, but as a celebrity.
Everything you’ve done to this country over your eights years will be wiped from the history books, and your legacy, as much as it hurts right now, will be nothing more than a distant memory.
I wish you farewell, and I’m hopeful for the future of my country, which just proved that it deserves someone better than you.

Joe Biden’s New Book to Be Released in November,"Continue reading the main storyShare This Page
Continue reading the main story
In November 2014, six months before Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s son, Beau, died after a battle with brain cancer, the family gathered in Nantucket, Mass. During what would be his final Thanksgiving, Mr. Biden told his father: “Promise me, Dad. Give me your word that no matter what happens, you’re going to be all right.” Those words have inspired the title of the former vice president’s upcoming book.
On Monday, Flatiron Books revealed that the acquisition, which was first announced in April as part of a joint deal with Mr. Biden’s wife, Jill Biden (details about her book have yet to be given), would be titled “Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose” and be released on Nov. 14. In it, Mr. Biden will reflect on that painful year and the challenges he faced fulfilling his political duties while mourning the death of his son.
“I hope my own story will strike a chord with other Americans who have walked the same path I have,” he said in a statement. “I have always been fortunate to have an incredible support system around me, and I understand how many people in this country go through far worse than I have, with far less support.”
This fall Mr. Biden will also embark on a tour, traveling to 19 cities across the country, starting with New York on Nov. 13, to host panel discussions with local leaders. (The events will be overseen by Creative Artists Agency, which represents Mr. Biden.) He hopes to start conversations that go beyond “the 24-hour news cycle and 140-character arguments,” a statement said. Tickets, which go on sale July 28, will include a copy of his book.
“‘Promise Me, Dad' is unlike any other book I’ve read by a political figure, thanks to Vice President Joe Biden’s willingness to be deeply personal on the one hand, and candid about political life on the other,” said Bob Miller, the president and publisher of Flatiron Books. “It’s that rare book by a politician that will truly have lasting resonance.”
“Promise Me, Dad” will be edited by Colin Dickerman, the editorial director of Flatiron Books.

REPORT: Massive Money Trail FOUND From George Soros to TOP Senator!,"June 23, 2017 by Thomas Rhett
Reports say that the institute’s donors and McCain’s personal leadership in the organization’s exclusive “Sedona Forum” bear an uncanny resemblance to the glitzy Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) that annually co-mingled special interests and powerful political players in alleged pay-to-play schemes.
The institute accepted contributions of as much as $100,000 from billionaire liberal activist-funder George Soros and from Teneo, $1 million from a Saudi Arabian donator, $100,000 from a Moroccan state-run company tied to repeated charges of worker abuse and exploitation and $100,000 from the Pivotal Foundation, created by Francis Najafi.
Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at Public Citizen, said:
“THIS IS A VERY REAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST. THIS IS THE SIMILAR TYPE OF PATTERN WE RECEIVED WITH THE CLINTON FOUNDATION IN WHICH FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND FOREIGN INTERESTS WERE THROWING A LOT OF MONEY IN THE HOPES OF TRYING TO BUY INFLUENCE.”
Lawrence Noble, general counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, said:
“IN TERMS OF THE ETHICS OF IT, IT DOES RAISE A BROAD QUESTION OF PEOPLE TRYING TO GET GOOD WILL WITH THE ELECTED OFFICIAL. FROM A PERSONAL STANDPOINT, I’D RATHER NOT SEE THESE ENTITIES EXIST.”
Retired Wall Street investment banker and philanthropy law expert Charles Ortel added that “high government officials such as John McCain, [former Secretary of State] Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama should not get involved with vehicles like these where substantial sums can be funneled over time in ways that at best, reeks of impropriety and at worse are public corruption.”

"Saudi Arabia, allies give Qatar two more days to accept demands","FILE PHOTO: People sit on the corniche in Doha, Qatar, June 15, 2017.
A man writes on a painting depicting Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani in Doha, Qatar.
A man uses a rod to fish during sunset on the corniche in Doha, Qatar, June 15, 2017.
DUBAI/DOHA Four Arab states which accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism agreed to extend until late on Tuesday a deadline for Doha to comply with a list of demands, as U.S. President Donald Trump voiced concern to both sides about the dispute.
Qatar has called the accusations baseless and says the demands - which include closing Qatar-based al Jazeera TV and ejecting Turkish troops based there - are so severe that they seem designed to be rejected.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have raised the possibility of further sanctions against Qatar if it does not comply with the 13 demands presented to Doha through Kuwait, which is acting as a mediator.
According to a joint statement on Saudi state news agency SPA, the four countries agreed to a request by Kuwait to extend by 48 hours Sunday's deadline for compliance.
They have not specified what further sanctions they could impose on Doha, but commercial bankers in the region believe that Saudi, Emirati and Bahraini banks might receive official guidance to pull deposits and interbank loans from Qatar.
Foreign ministers from the four countries will meet in Cairo on Wednesday to discuss Qatar, Egypt said, while Kuwaiti state media reported that Qatari foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani had submitted to Kuwait Doha's formal response to the Arab states' demands.
The four states cut diplomatic and commercial ties with Qatar on June 5, accusing it of supporting terrorism, meddling in their internal affairs and advancing the agenda of regional foe Iran, all of which Qatar denies. Mediation efforts, including by the United States, have been fruitless.
The crisis has hit travel, food imports and sown confusion among businesses, while pushing Qatar closer to Iran and Turkey. But it has not hit energy exports from Qatar, the world's biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Trump spoke separately on Sunday to the leaders of Saudi Arabia and Qatar and the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi in the UAE to discuss his ""concerns about the ongoing dispute"", the White House said.
""He reiterated the importance of stopping terrorist financing and discrediting extremist ideology. The president also underscored that unity in the region is critical to accomplishing the Riyadh Summit's goals of defeating terrorism and promoting regional stability,"" it said.
""President Trump, nevertheless, believes that the overriding objective of his initiative is the cessation of funding for terrorism,"" the White House added.
Qatar, a small peninsular country protruding into the Gulf with a population of about 2.2 million, a majority of them expatriates, hosts the biggest U.S. military base in the Gulf.
A State Department official said on Sunday that the United States encouraged ""all parties to exercise restraint to allow for productive diplomatic discussions"".
Qatari officials say the demands are so strict that the four countries never seriously intended them as a negotiating position and see them as being aimed at hobbling Doha's sovereignty.
Qatar says it is interested in negotiating a fair and just solution to ""any legitimate issues"" of concern to fellow member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE.
Qatar's Gulf critics accuse Al Jazeera of being a platform for extremists and an agent of interference in their affairs. The network has rejected the accusations and said it will maintain its editorial independence.
Gulf countries have insisted that their demands are non- negotiable.
The UAE's minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, has played down the chances of an escalation, saying ""the alternative is not escalation but parting ways"", suggesting Qatar may be forced out of the GCC.
The Western-backed GCC was formed in 1981 in the wake of Iran's Islamic Revolution and the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war.
Qataris are waiting anxiously for a resolution of the conflict but have remained largely supportive of the government.
Shopping for groceries in a Doha mall, Qatari Abdul Aziz al-Horr, who works in business education, said he hoped no new sanctions were coming.
""Any escalation will be something that is not for the good of anybody. Destabilizing Qatar will have a major impact on the whole region, and even globally,"" he said.

So Imran Awan, the IT staffer who worked for Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and the DNC was arrested on Monday night at Dulles Aiport while attempting to flee the country. Of course, my guess is he only bought a one-way ticket. I highly doubt he was thinking of returning.
You don’t smash blackberry phones or computers and then take your time getting out of the country. This guy knows a lot. Right, Hillary? He also got paid a lot. We’re talking about him and his family taking in over $4 million over 4 or 5 years.
So what does a criminal who worked for the DNC do? What every other criminal that the DNC wants to protect does, he hires a lawyer that worked for the Clinton family! Afterall, crime does pay when it comes to the Clintons.
Of course, how else are the Democrats and Hillary going to keep the Russian-Trump narrative going, if this character is not protected?
Don’t forget the Awans had access to a lot of top secret information, and a lot of juicy information on various members of Congress too. They probably STILL have it. Who knows? Maybe they’ve even been selling a lot of top secret information to ISIS and making a pretty good buck…thanks to Debbie ‘Blabbermouth’ Schultz and the Clintons.
I won’t be suprised if you don’t hear anything about the death of Molly McCauley and stolen data on geostationary satellites that the Awan’s were also connected to.
Conservative Review, reported Imran Awan has decided to hire a lawyer with longstanding connections to the Clinton family for legal help.
This is really not surprising is it? Afterall, Imran Awan did work for Debbie ‘Blabbermouth’ Schultz since 2005. You really didn’t think the Clintons were going to let this snake get eaten by the Republicans did you? The Awan brothers have way too much knowledge, power and money to just go quietly off to jail.
Chris Gowen, a founding partner at Gowen, Rhoades, Winograd and Silva, apparently did a little bit of everything for the Clintons over the course of multiple years including working in the Clinton White House, helping President Bill Clinton write his book, “My Life”, and serving on Hillary’s 2008 presidential campaign. Per Gowen’s bio:
Mr. Gowen left the Public Defender’s office to work for former President William Jefferson Clinton and then-Senator Hillary Clinton. Chris was a fact checker for President Clinton’s memoir, My Life. He also served as a traveling aid for President Clinton’s national and international trips. Chris finished his tenure with the Clintons by directing the advance operations for then-Senator Hillary Clinton during her 2008 presidential campaign.
Another biography, published on the American University website, says Gowen worked with several other controversial Clinton projects, including The Clinton Global Initiative, The Clinton Foundation, and The Clinton Health Access Initiative.
Yep! Awan is definitely an ‘asset’ being protected by the Clintons and the DNC.
Shortly after Awan’s arrest, Gowen immediately jumped into the fray and hit the ground running with allegations that Awan was a victim of Islamophobia. He labeled Awan’s arrest as part of “a right-wing media-driven prosecution by a United States Attorney’s Office that wants to prosecute people for working while Muslim”…it’s almost as if the words are coming straight from Hillary’s mouth.
(pictured: Chris Gowen – Clinton loyalist and Awan lawyer.)
Imran Awan was arrested and has been charged with bank fraud. Although I wouldnt’ be surprised if more charges come down from all the evidence that is found. However, whether or not he is charged…that’s a different story.
While details are scarce, media reports have alleged that Awan and his brothers potentially ran a procurement scheme in which they bought equipment, then overcharged various House members that employed their IT firm.
Meanwhile, some congressional technology aides have alleged that the Awan’s were blackmailing representatives based on the contents of their emails and files, due to the fact that these representatives have displayed unwavering and intense loyalty towards the former aides.
I highly doubt the Awan’s were behind the blackmailing. It is more likely the CLINTONS were behind the blackmailing. How else do you get all those members to vote for the things you need to help you make money for the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative?
As background, Imran was first employed in 2004 by former Democrat Rep. Robert Wexler (FL) as an “information technology director”, before he began working in Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s office in 2005.
The family was paid extremely well, with Imran Awan being paid nearly $2 million working as an IT support staffer for House Democrats since 2004. Abid Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, were each paid more than $1 million working for House Democrats. In total, since 2003, the family has collected nearly $5 million.
In total, Imran’s firm was employed by 31 Democrats in Congress, some of whom held extremely sensitive positions on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.
If you look closely you can see a few familiar names from Florida, especially in Broward County like Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL23), Frederica Wilson (D-FL24), Ted Deutch (D-FL21), and Lois Frankel (D-FL22). That pretty much takes care of Broward County – Fort Lauderdale and Miami area.
Hmm! Where was Beranton Whisenant the attorney who was murdered and who was investigating voter fraud and fake passports found? He was found dead on a beach in that same area – Hollywood, Florida. Coincidence? I think not.
I have to agree with some of the questions coming from the RNC Chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel:
Debbie Wasserman Shultz needs to answer mounting questions about her staffer’s questionable and illegal actions…",Ihavethetruth,1
GST impact on tyre industry: Demand set to shoot up; here is why,"Initial challenges aside, the new regime brings good news for the tyre industry, as an increased movement of heavy commercial vehicles across states will result in an increased demand for tyres.
After years of being in consultation and preparation mode, GST has finally become a reality. The one nation-one tax regime has, in a stroke, pulled down interstate barriers, resulting in less redundancy bringing more uniformity in the economy. I am sure GST will encourage seamless flow of tax credit from the manufacturer to the retailer, and accelerate employment generation by boosting economic activity. It can push India up in the global rankings of the ease of doing business. The assurance that teething troubles will soon be over is timely, as it will address industry concerns that the transition could disrupt the working capital cycle due to ‘input credit lock-up’ in the initial months.
Impact on the tyre industry
As an integral part of the logistics and transport industry, the tyre manufacturing sector will benefit from GST. Initial challenges aside, the new regime brings good news for the tyre industry, as an increased movement of heavy commercial vehicles across states will result in an increased demand for tyres. The elimination of the complex multi-layered indirect taxation system will also simplify processes and bring efficacy in product costs, although it is too early to put a number to that.
The GST regime taxes commercial tyres at 28%, but we are hopeful that the simultaneous abolition of octroi duty—which was a hurdle in timely delivery of goods and smooth movement of vehicles—will make a difference. A uniform tax structure will help in evasion of unfair trade practices, eliminating under-invoicing and falsification of costs. The tyre industry is ready and has prepared itself extensively across its large network of dealers, suppliers and natural rubber growers through a series of GST-related outreach workshops on understanding and implementing new compliances under the GST regime.
You may also like to watch:
Likewise, JK Tyre has undertaken extensive orientation and training programmes for our own, as well as all stakeholders to make ourselves GST-compliant, so as to undergo this transformation with least pain.
With a concerted effort between the industry and the government, I am sure adapting to the new system will not be all that difficult.

Melania Trump didn’t get the memo.
While greeting India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House, Melania decided to wear a gorgeous yellow Emilio Pucci dress.
And she’s beautiful in that dress. However, want to know how much that dress cost?
That’s right. More than many citizens in the United States make in a month.
Now, did Michelle Obama wear designer gowns? Sure she did. She often wore various designers at different big events. But we also saw Michelle in Banana Republic outfits, J Crew, and shopping at Target. She definitely came off far more as a woman of the people.
Nonetheless, that’s a lot of money Melania spent on a dress to wear at home on a Monday. Sure, she was meeting a foreign leader, but still. C’mon now. But to her credit, she does look amazing in it.

For four days in July of 1967, Newark was the epicenter of black rage. The rioting left 26 dead, more than 700 injured and nearly 1,500 arrested, mostly black. (July 10)
As it observes the 50th anniversary of the 1967 event that some call a riot and others call a rebellion, Newark ponders a question: Have things gotten better or worse in New Jersey's largest city?
In this July 14, 1967, file photo, National Guardsmen stand at the corner of Springfield Avenue and Mercer Street in Newark, where days of violence and looting came to be known as the Newark riots.(Photo: Marty Lederhandler, AP)
NEWARK — Donald Trump’s critics say his claim that minority inner-city residents are “living in hell’’ is based on a Nixon-era view of urban America that ignores how much safer and healthier cities have become.
Now, the 50th anniversary of a long hot July when inner city life unquestionably was hellish — riots gutted Newark and Detroit, leaving 69 dead — calls the question. Have things really changed?
In Newark, an unfounded rumor that a man had died in police custody led to five nights of looting, arson and gunfire that left 26 dead, more than 1,400 arrested and the city’s Central Ward in ruins.
People here disagree whether to call what happened that July a “riot,” a “rebellion” or a “disturbance.’’ But this much is clear: The anniversary is both a reminder of how much worse some things were, and of how bad some still are.
“Newark’s recovery has had a dual nature,“ says Larry Hamm, a community activist. At 12 he watched “the rebellion’’ from his front porch; at 17 he was named to the Board of Education by the city’s first black mayor. “A lot of people can’t afford the new Newark. We have dynamism downtown, and poverty in the neighborhoods.’’
Those neighborhoods — like formerly Jewish Weequahic, which produced Philip Roth, and the once-solidly Italian North Ward where Frankie Valli was born Francesco Castelluccio — are the parts of the city now under the most stress.
In fact, “inner city’’ is an inapt synonym for urban misery. Most big city centers are thriving.
Skilled young people of all races want to live and work near the city’s museums, galleries, bars, clubs, restaurants, sports venues and vintage buildings. The city also appeals to older suburbanites seeking something more interesting than another a trip to the mall.

But the “inner city’’ to which Trump refers actually lies outside downtown, between center city and suburbia. Here, all the old problems persist: poverty and crime, crumbling infrastructure and racial segregation.
Max Herman is author of Summer of Rage, an oral history of the 1967 troubles. Despite downtown jewels such as the New Jersey Performing Arts Center and a new Whole Foods market inside the renovated Hahne & Co. department store building, he says, “Newark, in some ways, is worse than 1967.’’
Violent crime in the city has declined for four straight years, and Mayor Ras Baraka boasts of a ribbon-cutting or ground-breaking a week. But a third of residents are officially poor, and those who do work hold less than a fifth of the city’s jobs. The population, around 280,000, is down by a quarter since 1967.

Transcript of President Trump's inauguration speech
Trump made inner city conditions a campaign issue last summer. Speaking before largely white audiences, he called “our inner cities … a disaster’’ and said African-Americans and Hispanics had been neglected by the Democrats they’d long supported. Trump asked for their vote: “What do you have to lose?’’
In his GOP convention speech, he described cities overrun by gangs and used the term “law and order’’ four times. In the first presidential debate, he said that inner-city residents were “living in hell, because it's so dangerous.’’ In his inaugural address, he cited “mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities’’ as evidence of “American carnage.’’

Critics were surprised — Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page wrote that his “urban ‘disaster’ views sound frozen in the riot years of the 1960s’’ — and are skeptical. They say Trump is less concerned with black lives than white votes and is really addressing his extra-urban base.
But some here concede that Trump had a point. His description of the problem, if not his solution (including aggressive “stop-and-frisk” police tactics) — sounded like concerned liberals’ of what the black sociologist Kenneth Clark once called “the dark ghetto.’’
In July 1967, no ghetto was darker than Newark’s.
Here’s the city’s application that April for a federal grant: Among major cities, Newark “has the highest percentage of substandard housing, the most crime per 100,000 people, the heaviest per capita tax burden and the highest rates of venereal disease, new tuberculosis cases and maternal mortality.’’
Blacks constituted a majority of residents, but were routinely brutalized by a mostly white police force and marginalized by a white-controlled Democratic political establishment. When a school board seat came open, the mayor appointed another white man who’d never gone to college ahead of the state’s first black certified public accountant.
Grievances were endless, from expectations raised and frustrated by the federal War on Poverty to the planned demolition of an entire neighborhood to make way for an academic medical complex. “The city was a bomb waiting to go off,’’ says Kevin Mumford, a historian who wrote Newark: A History of Race, Rights, and Riots in America.
On July 12, it did.
Two white cops arrested and beat up a black taxi driver they accused of tailgating their cruiser. When a rumor spread that the cabbie had died, a crowd formed outside the police station. One of the protesters broke a window, officers responded, and a melee ensued.

As the violence spread, the National Guard rolled in and sealed off the exits. That did not save Fire Lt. Michael Moran, shot as he responded to a fire, or Eloise Spellman, a mother of 11 who was shot while leaning out of her apartment window.
The presidential commission that investigated the Newark disturbance and the Detroit riot that began on July 23rd concluded that “our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white — separate and unequal."" It urged a massive public remedial program, including billions to promote residential integration.
But Richard Nixon, the 1968 Republican presidential nominee, drew a different conclusion. The riots underscored the need for law and order, which became a key issue in his narrow victory.
The Newark eruption created some enduring misconceptions.
In fact, they had been leaving for years. By 1967 Newark had half as many white residents as two decades earlier. But the riots did sever the city’s link with its suburbs, ending a symbiotic relationship in which suburbanites would return to their old neighborhoods to shop, eat or worship. After July 1967, most didn’t go into Newark unless they had do. And no one called what had happened that summer anything but a riot.
In fact, Washington, Trenton and the business community at first rallied to the city’s aid. In 1970 Kenneth Gibson was elected the city’s first black mayor. The nation’s eyes were on Newark. “Wherever American cities are going,’’ Gibson said, “Newark will get there first.’’
But the riot stigma was damaging enough. The Watts riots of 1965 did little to halt Los Angeles’ ascent; the city was too big, too rich. And even after its own riots that July, Detroit still had an identity – four major sports teams, a top 10 media market and the auto industry.
Newark, in contrast, was overshadowed by New York City, confined to compact footprint, and stripped of its factories.
By the time he was defeated for re-election in 1986, Gibson had disappointed both his supporters in the business community as well as ones like the poet Amiri Baraka (Ras’ father), who’d likened the 1970 election to the liberation of an African colony.
Gibson’s successor, Sharpe James (1986-2006), was convicted of fraud and sentenced to 27 months in federal prison. The bright promise of Cory Booker’s administration (2006-2013) was shadowed by crime and failing schools.
Max Herman says that black governance has been no more honest or efficient than white governance, and that economic power in the city is still not controlled by blacks, but by institutions and corporations controlled by whites.

The city has two memorials to July 1967: a plaque outside the police station where it all started, and a stone marker in a small park nearby listing the names of the fallen.
One does not even use the word “riot.’’ Lauren Craig, a local resident and author of the forthcoming Newark installment in the 100 Things to Do before You Die series, says that’s fitting: “It was a case of people reacting to brutality and discrimination. It was not people with no morals running wild in the streets.’’
It would — and could — happen again, says Mumford, the historian: “How is Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 different from Newark in 1967?''

Mike F*ckabee”s Comparison Of Trump To A Doctor Will Make You Puke (TWEETS),"Arkansas Governor and two-time failed presidential candidate Mike Huckabee has an interesting description of President Donald Trump.
“Donald Trump is kind of like a doctor who sometimes has a rather gruff bedside manner. Nobody’s going to argue that point.”
“He can be crude and he can come across sometimes less than people think, but, by golly, the patient is alive and I’d rather have this president, who gets things done, than one who comes in, he’s nice and he’s polite and he smiles, but my family member dies in the hospital bed. America needs to say two words to Donald Trump: Thank you.”
Keeping the patient alive? What is Mike Huckabee on? Trump is killing the patient day by day. This isn’t the first time he’s used some strange analogies. His Twitter feed is full of them. Here are some gems from it:

"Revealed! Obama Busted For Obstruction? Most Recent Congressional Investigation Report Uncovers All, You’ll Be Shocked","Home Uncategorized Revealed! Obama Busted For Obstruction? Most Recent Congressional Investigation Report Uncovers All,...
 
In his energy to trash weapons in America, previous President Obama permitted guns made and sold in the US to unlawfully fall under the control of Mexican drug cartels in what has turned out to be known as “Operation Fast and Furious.” “Fast and Furious” was intended to catch and capture those cartel individuals. Shockingly, the most exceedingly awful conceivable situation happened.
The operation reverse releases when a Border Patrol operator named Brian Terry was killed by a cartel part with one of those weapons. The resulting conceal and muddling by Obama and his operators are presently causing issues down the road for the previous president, as another congressional investigation report is investigating a conceivable charge of “obstruction of Congress.”Via Conservative Tribune:
Former President Barack Obama may not be in office anymore, but one of his scandals has not yet been laid back, as evidenced by a recent report from Congress.
In a report titled the House Oversight Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee found fault with the Obama administration’s handling of the scandal that helped arm Mexican drug cartels.
In particular, the report blasted Obama and his Justice Department for “obstruction of the Congress” and was less than coming with the media and victims’ families about what really happened.
When Border Terror agent was killed in a “Fast and Furious” gun during a 2010 firefight with Mexican gang members and the scandal blew up in the Obama administration’s face, the Justice Department was “focused more on spin and obfuscation than getting the facts Right, “the report noted.
Even when Terry’s family sought answers from Obama’s top law enforcement agency, the congressional report found that the DOJ viewed them as nothing more than “public relations displeasure.”
The report was unforgiving in its findings that the gave false information to Congress in order to cover up the truth of the sour operation.
What’s most concerned, however, was that the misrepresentations to the Congress came from the very top.
Then-Attorney General Eric Holder, who was found in contempt of Congress in the House, has denied “thousands of key documents,” and he even asked Obama to execute his “executive privilege” over “all documents related to Justice Department’s responses to Congressional questions about Fast and Furious. “
Of course, Obama sided with his liberal buddy and “dishonestly” allowed the administration’s refusal to comply with lawful congressional subpoenas in order to “obstruct the investigation.”
“In the course of that investigation, nearly six years ago, the Justice Department wrote to the Congress and falsely denied that law enforcement officers allowed straw purchasers to illegally purchase firearms in the United States and traffic them without being apprehended,” the report explained. “Since that false denial, the Committees have investigated why the Department of Justice misled Congress and failed to correct its misrepresentation in a timely manner.”
Fortunately, whistleblowers came forward with their knowledge of “Fast and Furious,” allowing Congress to piece together a more accurate picture than the fragmented version they received from Obama’s cronies.
Thank goodness for whistleblowers! If they were not for them, who knows what evils could be perpetrated by self-serving politicians.
Thank heavens for informants! If not for them, who realizes what shades of malice could be executed independently from anyone else serving lawmakers.
It is certainly route past time for Barack Obama’s violations to be uncovered for all the world to see. He was and still is, evidently, not disinclined to utilizing even the most criminal intends to accomplish his targets.

"Father Fatally Shoots Daughter While Teaching Gun Safety, ‘I Thought it was Empty’","Written by Keely Sharp
An Indiana father was teaching his children gun safety and told them not to ever play with a gun “because it can kill someone.” Sadly, he did not actually practice gun safety during this lesson.
The first rule of handling a gun is to always treat it as if it is loaded. That means you do not point it at anyone or anything that you would not want to kill or destroy.
Not only did Eric Hummel break that first, and most important, rule but he also did not even check and double check the chamber to ensure that there was not a loaded bullet.
Due to his carelessness, the lesson he attempted to teach his children will forever have impact on his two little boys who witnessed Hummel shoot and kill their 9-year-old sister, Olivia.
Eric Hummel sobbed while reporting the shooting during a 911 call on June 10, telling the dispatcher, “This can’t be real,” the Post-Tribune reported. His daughter, Olivia, died about 30 minutes later at a hospital.
TRENDING ON EAGLE RISING
Authorities said the 33-year-old father was showing his sons a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun when he inadvertently shot Olivia as she walked into the room. Hummel told the 911 dispatcher he didn’t realize the gun was loaded when he pulled the trigger.
The dispatcher instructed Hummel to perform CPR on his daughter until emergency responders arrived. An autopsy showed the girl was shot in the forehead at close range.
The newspaper obtained the 911 call recording through a public records request.
Hummel said, “I had my gun, and I pulled the trigger. I didn’t realize there was a bullet in there, and I shot my daughter.”
The dispatcher asked him if he could perform CPR to which he asked, “Should I press on her chest?”
“Yes,” the dispatcher responded.
Hummel said, “She’s got blood, man, everywhere,” and then he could be heard whispering, “Please don’t go.”
Hummel reportedly called the girl’s mother from the police station and told her to go to the hospital because their daughter was dead. One of the responding officers reportedly overheard Hummel say, “I shot her. I’m so sorry.”
One of Hummel’s sons—the 9-year-old—said his father pointed the gun at him “probably like two times” and “a few times” at the other brother, the police report alleged.
Hobart Police Chief Richard W. Zormier said at a press conference, “I believe this was a series of heinous and depraved acts committed by the suspect on June 10. His actions that day endangered the lives of all three children and ultimately stole the life of Olivia, an innocent 9-year-old girl.”
He continued, “His actions caused the death of Olivia and likely scarred the boys emotionally for life.”
Hummel is now facing multiple charges including: reckless homicide and child neglect. According to his attorney, Paul Stracci, he plans to plead not guilty.
Stracci stated, “Anyone who knows him knows he loves his kids more than anything in the world and would never do anything to hurt them.”
Hummel’s next scheduled court date Aug. 24.

Trump Throws Massive Temper Tantrum In Front Of MLB’s Chicago Cubs (VIDEO),"Kevin Paul-June 28, 2017
At some point we have to just accept that our sitting president is a man-child and a national embarrassment. Today served as another reminder that Donald Trump doesn’t know how to behave like anything more than a spoiled elementary school student upset that he didn’t get picked for the dodge ball team and who, then, takes his balls home.
Trump decided to use the White House visit by the World Series champions, the Chicago Cubs, as an opportunity to take a jab at the NBA Finals champions, the Golden State Warriors:
“This is a great team and they were actually here but they wanted to be here with Trump, right?”
Watch as Trump can’t help himself:
First, what reasonable adult refers to himself in third person? Second, what mature adult makes every occasion about his ego? Today’s event was meant to celebrate the hard-fought victory of the Chicago Cubs not to assuage the bruised ego of a 70-year-old child.
And if the Golden State Warriors make the decision to not visit the White House because of Trump, his behavior today underscores why no one would ever want to be in the room with him.

Donald Trump Jr. Releases ‘Russia Meeting’ Email Chain,"Donald Trump Jr. just released an email chain showing how the latest Russian meeting went down. Anti-Trump media have been using this meeting as evidence of Russian collusion. The emails show that there was no cooperation or collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. It only shows Donald Trump Jr. agreeing to a meeting.
If this is the ‘smoking gun’ liberals were hoping for, they will be really disappointed.
Here is the email chain:

Of course the left thinks this will finally nail Trump. For instance, Vox said “The Donald Trump Jr. emails change everything,” and boasted:
“In the thread, Goldstone goes on to schedule a meeting between Trump Jr. and a “Russian government attorney” who he said would convey the information. Trump Jr. also forwards on the thread to Jared Kushner and then-Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort, confirming the time of the meeting.
“To be blunt: This changes everything.
“The email thread makes clear that Donald Trump Jr. was aware of and willing to support a Russian government effort to help his father’s campaign.”
But then they readily admit that there is still nothing proven, no crime here. Thus showing once again that the liberal media is pushing crazy Russian conspiracy theories in order to push traffic to their left-wing sites and give false hope to the ANTIFA type crowd:
“There remains a great deal we still don’t know about the Russia scandal. For instance, what, if anything, Trump’s team actually ended up doing with the Russians is still unclear. Did any collaborative effort or private understanding materialize in the end? Was the Trump campaign tipped off about the Russian hacking and planned leaks of prominent Democrats’ emails? What, exactly, did Donald Trump know?”
Former Governor Mike Huckabee summed up this bizarre frenzy with this tweet:
Liberal media in a frenzy because Donald Trump Jr released all his emails. Should've just deleted them. We know that's fine with them!

"Idiot Lib Thought It Would Be Funny To Burn The Flag On The 4th, Watch What Happens Next","Bryton Mellot, a 22-year-old Illinois man, made headlines last year for posting a controversial photo of himself burning the American flag. He was arrested for his Fourth of July stunt after authorities charged him with violating the state’s flag desecration law. He was ultimately released without charges.
“I am not proud to be an American,” Mellot commented. “In this moment, being proud of my country is to ignore the atrocities committed against people of color, people living in poverty, people who identify as women, and against my own queer community on a daily basis.”
“I would like to one day feel a sense of pride toward my nationality again,” he continued. “But too little progress has been made.

Rescuers on Wednesday looking for survivors of a five-story building collapse a day before in Mumbai.Credit Rafiq Maqbool/Associated Press
MUMBAI, India — The Mumbai police on Wednesday arrested a man affiliated with a local political party, accusing him of making illegal alterations to the ground floor of a five-story building that caused it to collapse a day earlier, killing at least 17 people and injuring a dozen others.
Deven Bharti, joint commissioner of the Mumbai police, said charges of culpable homicide and endangering the lives of others had been filed against the man, Sunil Shitap. Mr. Bharti said the police believed that Mr. Shitap had been making illegal alterations to the ground floor of the building, where he operated a nursing home, in Ghatkopar, an area east of the city center.
Relatives of the victims and other residents of the building said Mr. Shitap was affiliated with Shiv Sena, a local party. His wife, Swati Shitap, contested and lost local elections earlier this year as a member of the party.
“He had three flats on the ground floor that he emptied and broke the foundational pillar, which is why the building fell,” Vandana Singh, 45, who had lived in the building for nine years, said in an interview.

Ms. Singh said she had left her first-floor apartment just 10 minutes before the building collapsed to take her daughter to a tutoring session. Now, she said, she had lost everything and was staying with her mother.

Rescuers continued Wednesday digging through the rubble of the building for any survivors. Mr. Bharti, the police commissioner, confirmed that 17 people had been killed and 12 injured, many of whom remained hospitalized.
The building’s collapse is reflective of a sadly familiar phenomenon in India. A severe housing shortage, lax regulation and political corruption have resulted in too many people crowded into old, weak and substandard structures. Politically connected people such as contractors and developers often circumvent safety rules with impunity until disaster strikes.
The building that fell was nondescript, at the end of a cul-de-sac in a lower-middle-class neighborhood. Most residents owned their apartments, and many were in the upper four floors when the building collapsed about 10:45 a.m.
Mr. Shitap, who is in police custody, could not be reached for comment Wednesday morning. But Mumbai’s mayor, Vishwanath Mahadeshwar, who is from the Shiv Sena party, on Tuesday denied that any of its members owned the nursing home.

Trump administration hits 13 Venezuelans with sanctions in advance of critical vote,"A demonstrator wears a Venezuelan flag Wednesday during a strike called to protest President Nicolás Maduro's government in Caracas. (Marco Bello/Reuters)
By Karen DeYoung and Anthony Faiola By Karen DeYoung and Anthony Faiola July 26 at 11:38 PM Follow @karendeyoung1 Follow @Anthony_Faiola
The Trump administration placed sanctions on 13 current and former senior Venezuelan officials Wednesday and warned that it was prepared to take far more draconian measures if President Nicolás Maduro does not cancel a vote this weekend to choose a new congress.
Those hit with sanctions include top officials from the government, the security services and the Venezuelan oil industry. The measures, which freeze any money that they have in the United States and prohibit U.S. citizens or financial institutions from any dealing with them, are the latest in a series of steps administration officials described as a “steady drumbeat” of pressure on the Maduro government.
The vote scheduled for Sunday to elect a new super-assembly is widely seen as a move by Maduro to consolidate his power amid widespread opposition protests that have virtually shut down the country and a security crackdown that has led to deaths and massive arrests.
In a statement this month, President Trump said the United States would support Venezuelans standing for “democracy, freedom and the rule of law” ignored by “a bad leader who dreams of becoming a dictator” and “will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles.” He promised “strong and swift economic actions” if the vote takes place.
[Things are so bad in Venezuela that people are rationing toothpaste]
The administration has done nothing to dampen speculation that those actions could include an embargo on oil imports from Venezuela, the United States’ third-largest foreign supplier. An embargo could increase energy prices in this country and affect supply and distribution through Citgo, Venezuela’s U.S. refining subsidiary.
“Sectoral sanctions,” as they are called, “are something that are certainly under consideration,” said one of several senior administration officials who briefed reporters Wednesday on the administration-imposed condition of anonymity.
“All options are still on the table for the president to take after July 30,” the official said. “Certainly our hope is that ­Maduro will change his position.”
Response options will go to Trump for a decision, the official said, and the government was doing a “fully thorough analysis to try to understand the impact of options not just on Venezuela but also on the U.S. . . . The goal is to try to prevent as much harm to the U.S. economy, while maximizing [impact] on the Venezuelan regime.”
On Wednesday, Maduro responded in an interview with the Russian outlet RT, saying he was in the midst of striking “important” new oil and gas deals with Moscow and calling on Trump to stop his “aggression.”
“For what it’s worth, I’d like, as president, to some day speak with [Trump], shake hands and tell him that we’re in the 21st century, and to forget the Monroe doctrine,” Maduro said. “That it’s time to accept diversity, and of a new time of quality relationship”
“My message is in particular to President Trump, stop your aggression to Venezuela, stop your interventionism in Latin America,” he continued.
As the crisis in Venezuela has continued, the U.S. Congress and other nations in the hemisphere have been widely supportive of action against the Maduro government.
“The expansion of targeted sanctions against Maduro cronies with Venezuelans’ blood on their hands is not only appropriate, it was necessary,” said Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.). “The implosion of Venezuela has already claimed the lives of hundreds and left millions hungry and desperate, and yet not one single Venezuelan government official or member of the security forces has been held accountable for their role in the beating, shooting, jailing or killing of Venezuela’s citizens and democracy.”
People familiar with the administration’s internal discussions said that Trump favors a strong response and has been inclined toward targeting Venezuela’s oil sector. Officials at the State and Energy departments have been more cautious, warning, as have some of Maduro’s opponents in Venezuela, that such a move could have a devastating impact on the ground.
Venezuela counts on U.S. oil sales as a major source for dwindling supplies of hard currency and uses the dollars it earns to cover food and medicine imports.
Cutting off those supplies should significantly ratchet up the pressure on Maduro but exacerbate already bad shortages of food and medicines for long-suffering Venezuelans.
The list issued Tuesday contained powerful figures in Venezuela’s ruling elite, including Elías José Jaua Milano, Maduro’s minister spearheading Sunday’s vote, and Tibisay Lucena Ramírez, head of the electoral council that opponents have charged with fraud.
But just as significant was the decision to extend the sanctions to the military and state-run oil sector, a move potentially signaling to powerful forces in the country that they would not be immune from the response against Maduro.
Those officials included the recently named army commander Jesús Rafael Suárez Chourio and Sergio José Rivero Marcano, whose National Guard has been battling protesters. Another key name: Simón Alejandro Zerpa Delgado, a senior executive at the state-owned oil giant.
But few thought the U.S. step would prevent Sunday’s vote.
“Do I think that it’s going to work? I honestly don’t think these kinds of sanctions usually work,” said Michael Pinfold, a global fellow with the Wilson Center’s Latin America program.
As pressure on Maduro continued to build, anti-government forces were staging a 48-hour strike that shut down large parts of the capital Wednesday, with a massive march on Caracas being organized for Friday or Saturday.
In the wealthier eastern half of the city, most businesses closed to support the strike called by the opposition, which is boycotting the vote and calling for its cancellation.
The main highways of the capital city were largely closed down in the early morning, and reports surfaced of national police lobbing tear gas at strikers in the center. In the poorer neighborhoods in the west, the strike appeared less pronounced, with more businesses open and more people on the streets.

Federal Court Rules Against Trump’s Unpresidential Twitter Behavior (DETAILS),"GooglePinterestDiggLinkedin Reddit Stumbleupon PrintDeliciousPocketTumblr
One of the things that has plagued America — besides Donald Trump himself — is the POTUS’ Twitter usage. Every day, Trump’s Twitter account serves as an endless amount of humiliation and chaos for a country that was once well-respected around the world. While Trump has proven to his staff (and the country) that he cannot be controlled on social media, a federal court may have just ruled that there are some things he just CANNOT do on Twitter.
Subscribe to our Youtube Channel
One of Trump’s most disturbing behaviors lies in his tendency to block people on Twitter just because they disagree with him. Currently, Trump is being sued by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University for blocking people just because they expressed criticism. Thanks to a federal court ruling that happened this week, Trump may not be able to do that anymore.
This week, a federal court ruled on a case very similar to Trump’s, in which the chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, Phyllis J. Randall, had been blocking constituents on her public Facebook page. In the case Davison v. Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, Randall wrote on her county Facebook page, “I really want to hear from ANY Loudoun citizen on ANY issues, request, criticism, compliment, or just your thoughts.” When Brian C. Davidson took her up on her offer, bringing up the alleged corruption in the county’s school board, Randall responded by deleting his comment and blocking him. The following morning, Randall unblocked Davidson but he was not able to comment on her page or send her messages. Davidson argued that this was a violation of his freedom of speech, and a federal court ruled in his favor.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled that this was a violation of the First Amendment’s Free Speech Clause because Randall was “offended by his criticism of her colleagues in the County government”, which he regarded as unconstitutional “viewpoint discrimination” — pretty much what Trump does on Twitter. Cacheris explained:
Defendant’s offense at Plaintiff’s views was therefore an illegitimate basis for her actions—particularly given that Plaintiff earned Defendant’s ire by criticizing the County government. Indeed, the suppression of critical commentary regarding elected officials is the quintessential form of viewpoint discrimination against which the First Amendment guards. By prohibiting Plaintiff from participating in her online forum because she took offense at his claim that her colleagues in the County government had acted unethically, Defendant committed a cardinal sin under the First Amendment.
This certainly has implications to what might happen with Trump’s own Twitter account. While Trump might try to argue that his personal Twitter page — separate from the @POTUS presidential account — is not intended to function as a public forum, it’s obvious that Trump uses it to make presidential announcements. Members of his own team, such as former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, have even stated that Trump’s tweets are “official statements” — which means this account should be subjected to the same rules as Randall’s public Facebook page was.

Trump offers job of German ambassador to Richard Grenell,"Updated 11:00 PM ET, Thu July 20, 2017
Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.

(CNN)President Donald Trump has offered Richard Grenell the job of ambassador to Germany, according to two sources familiar with the conversation between Grenell and Trump.
Grenell, a 50-year-old Michigan native, is a former spokesman for the US at the United Nations and was one of the President's earliest and most vocal foreign policy supporters, vociferously backing the real estate magnate at a time when many in the Republican foreign policy establishment were publicly and staunchly opposed to his candidacy.
An administration official said nothing has been formalized, but last week Grenell posted to Twitter a photo of himself with Trump inside the Oval Office with the words ""Thank you, Mr. President.""
Thank You, Mr. President. @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/vzN1GTdB9Z
— Richard Grenell (@RichardGrenell) July 12, 2017
The administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity said Grenell's ""very long service at the United Nations and during the Bush administration and the contacts he established through that are very strongly in his favor.""
""I think it's natural the President would want to put him in a position he considers important,"" the official said, adding that nothing has been confirmed. ""In the event this comes to be, it seems a very logical appointment.""
Grenell, who has worked as a Fox News commentator, would come to the job in Germany with diplomatic experience, a dash of controversy and the personal distinction of being Trump's first openly gay ambassador nominee.
Grenell gained notoriety for snarling attacks on Obama administration officials and a Twitter feed that he used to hurl darts at Democratic women and even Republican targets such as Newt Gingrich and his wife Callista, now nominated to be Trump's ambassador to the Vatican.
While his commentary gained him fans among conservative circles, the fact he's openly gay made some social conservatives uneasy. At the very least, his aggressive tweets and comments were likely a factor in his dismissal from the campaign of then Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in 2012.
Grenell was the longest serving US spokesman at the United Nations, serving four ambassadors to the UN under President George W. Bush. During that time he regularly stepped in for the ambassador to represent the US inside the Security Council.
And, at a time of a reported strain in ties between the US and Germany, where Trump is deeply unpopular, Grenell has long experience working with German counterparts, both on the issue of Iran sanctions and UN reform.
RELATED: While campaigning, Merkel says Europeans can't 'completely' rely on US, others
He would have to manage differences between Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on issues ranging from climate change and the Paris Accord to immigration. Trump has broken conventions by publicly criticizing Merkel for her position on the refugee crisis and has repeatedly rapped other NATO members for not spending more on defense and their militaries.
G20 closes with rebuke to Trump's climate change stance
Beyond managing conflicts, Grenell's portfolio would cover the vast array of German-US cooperation that extends from intel sharing and military cooperation to trade. The deal to restrain Iran's nuclear program, which Grennell has called ""weak,"" would likely be a focus of his diplomacy with Berlin as well.
With the Trump administration expected to increase sanctions against Iran outside the nuclear realm, Grennell is expected to flag increased trade with Iran by German companies as a problem.
Grenell also worked for Arizona Sen. John McCain, a Republican, during his unsuccessful 2000 Presidential campaign.

"Nunes Goes Full Toddler Over Russia Probe: ‘I Can Do Whatever I Want, I’m The Chairman’","GooglePinterestDiggLinkedin Reddit Stumbleupon PrintDeliciousPocketTumblr
Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, stomped his feet like a big baby and said that he can do whatever he wants. Apparently, when he reportedly recused himself from the Russia probe, he wasn’t really recusing himself, he was merely stepping aside.
Subscribe to our Youtube Channel
“I can do whatever I want, I’m the chairman of the committee,” Nunes told CNN. “I voluntarily, temporarily stepped aside from leading the investigation.”
Well, he sure showed us a thing or two! By the way, it wasn’t just Democrats who wanted Nunes to recuse himself after he created a hot mess. In March, Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.) publicly called for Nunes to “absolutely” recuse himself from his panel’s investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election. “How can you be chairman of a major committee and do all these things behind the scenes and keep your credibility? You can’t keep your credibility,” Jones said at the time.
Still yet, Nunes blasted news outlets for reporting that he recused himself from the Russian probe.
“When I temporarily stepped aside from leading the investigation, that’s exactly what it means: It doesn’t mean I wasn’t going to be involved, it doesn’t mean I wasn’t going to be fully read in,” Nunes said.
Nunes said that even though he voluntarily stepped aside three months ago, he still has the final say in the matter.
“Every decision I make is my own,” he said. “I can go back right after this conversation and take the investigation over. Although I think everybody’s learning there’s not really much there because there’s no collusion — which is what I had said several months ago, I hadn’t seen any evidence.”
Nunes stepped aside from the House Russia investigation on April 6, after it was announced he was under investigation by the House ethics committee for possibly revealing classified information.
Well, Sport, everything will be revealed in the end, and Mr. Trump implicates himself every day on Twitter. If the former reality show star’s campaign did collude with Russia, then every single Republican who shielded him will be complicit, at least in the eyes of the public. Sometimes they go to prison.

GST impact on cigarettes: Council hikes cess after surprise windfall gains,"Apart from the highest GST rate of 28%, the cess on cigarettes will now be higher by Rs 485-792 per thousand sticks for different varieties of the commodity.
The Goods and Services (GST) Tax Council on Monday increased the cess on cigarettes to correct the unintended outcome of a reduced tax incidence on the demerit good after the roll-out of the new tax. Apart from the highest GST rate of 28%, the cess on cigarettes will now be higher by Rs 485-792 per thousand sticks for different varieties of the commodity. “While any reduction in tax incidence on items of mass consumption would be welcome, the same would be unacceptable in case of demerit goods like cigarettes,” the government said in a statement.
Meanwhile, the council reckoned that new registrations on the GST Network (GSTN), the IT backbone of the system, have been more than expected. Nearly 7.4 lakh new businesses have registered for GST since June 25 when the registration for new taxpayers was opened.
According a study conducted by GSTN, it was estimated that around 4-5 lakh new businesses would register with the system but the near doubling of that number has come as pleasant surprise to the government. GSTN had estimated that growth in the taxpayer base would be 4-5% on an annual basis.
With migration of over 70 lakh existing taxpayers into the GST system and another 7.4 lakh new taxpayers, the total GST taxpayer base is numerically close to the previous Centre-state indirect tax assessee base of 80 lakh. Finance minister Arun Jaitley noted that the taxpayer base must have actually expanded already as a section of taxpayers used to register separately for excise/service tax and VAT in the previous regime.
“With VAT and service tax registrations base of 80 lakh, we had estimated that not more than 4-5 lakh new taxpayers would register, but the numbers prove that businesses have welcomed GST,” GSTN chairman Navin Kumar told FE. He added that while the tax department could better analyse the spurt in numbers, it was possible that businesses realised it would be difficult to carry out trade from outside the ambit of GST.
Moreover, this number could jump further as nearly 35,000 new businesses are registering daily. This daily registration rate has not dwindled since June 25, when the window for new businesses to register was opened. In comparison, the daily migration figure for existing taxpayers had come down to 12,000 from 35,000 since June 25. Over 70 lakh existing taxpayers have migrated to GSTN till July 17 after the the migration window opened again on June 25.
However, just 90,000 businesses opted for the composition scheme so far. Kumar said that it was perhaps because the stringent eligibility criteria, which allows only those with intrastate supplies to register, may have played a part in the lukewarm response. Registration to the composition scheme is available to those with less than Rs 75 lakh per annum revenue, and is restricted to manufacturers and traders.
The window for the scheme will close by July 22 and the chairman urged the businesses to register for the scheme as early as possible as the next chance for the same would be available only next year.",Financial Express,0
Democrats Propose Building New Statue Of Liberty On Border,"A Democrat in Congress thinks we should build something else instead of a wall on the southern border. Democratic Rep.

“On the contrary, build another Statue of Liberty on the southern border,” Serrano said. “That’s our message to the world, that statute, not the wall.”
Serrano says that a wall would divide our country.

Former Brazil president Lula convicted of graft,"Brasília – Brazil’s former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was convicted of graft on Wednesday, becoming the biggest scalp yet in a sprawling political corruption probe engulfing Latin America’s largest economy.
Campaigning anti-corruption judge Sergio Moro sentenced Lula, who ruled Brazil from 2003-2010, to nine and a half years in prison for accepting a bribe of a luxury seaside apartment and $1.1 million.
But he said the 71-year-old Lula would remain free pending an appeal — something his lawyers said they would lodge immediately.
“We are appealing and will prove his innocence,” the lawyers said in a statement sent to AFP.
The conviction nevertheless landed a heavy blow on the prospect of Lula making a political comeback in presidential elections due in October next year.
The verdict also sent a dramatic message to much of the rest of Brazil’s political class that they, too, risked falling afoul of an anti-graft drive.

2 missing Burundi teens entered Canada; no foul play seen,"July 20, 2017 10:36 AM
 
Police have received reports that two of the Burundi teenagers gone missing after an international robotics competition have been seen crossing the border into Canada.
The whereabouts of their fellow team members remains unknown and the search for all the teens remains ongoing, but Metropolitan Police spokeswoman Aquita Brown stressed that police have no indication of foul play in their disappearance.
The teens seen crossing into Canada were 16-year-old Don Ingabire and 17-year-old Audrey Mwamikazi, Brown said.
Police tweeted missing person fliers Wednesday asking for help finding the teens, who had last been seen at the FIRST Global Challenge around the time of Tuesday's final matches. The missing team members include two 17-year-old girls and four males ranging in age from 16 to 18.
The competition, designed to encourage youths to pursue careers in math and science, attracted teams of teenagers from more than 150 nations.
A squad of girls from Afghanistan drew the most attention after they were twice rejected for U.S. visas and President Donald Trump intervened.
Competition organizers learned Tuesday night that the team's mentor couldn't find the six students who participated in the competition and organization President FIRST Global President Joe Sestak made the initial call to the police, according to a FIRST Global Challenge statement.
""Security of the students is of paramount importance to FIRST Global,"" organizers said, noting that they ensure students get to their dormitories after the competition by providing safe transportation to students staying at Trinity Washington University. The students ""are always to be under close supervision of their adult mentor and are advised not to leave the premises unaccompanied by the mentor.""
The mentor said the teens traveled from Burundi for the competition and have one-year visas, according to police reports. The mentor said they disappeared after the competition, but he doesn't know where they went. The reports say police tried to contact one missing teen's uncle but got no response. The reports state police canvassed DAR Constitution Hall, where the competition was held.
The competition's webpage about Team Burundi shows the six team members posing with a flag and says team members were selected from schools in Bujumbura, the capital city. The team's slogan in Kirundi is ""Ugushaka Nugushobora,"" which translates roughly to ""where there is a will, there is a way.""
Police tweeted images of the teens Wednesday, saying they are looking for 17-year-old girls, Audrey Mwamikazi and Nice Munezero; Richard Irakoze and Aristide Irambona, both 18; Kevin Sabumukiza, 17; and Don Ingabire, 16.
There was no indication Thursday that the teens intend to overstay their visas or apply for political asylum in the U.S., but if they do, the process could take years, according to Hassan Ahmad, an immigration lawyer in northern Virginia not involved in the situation.
If they make an application, he said, Immigration and Customs Enforcement could seek to detain the teens pending removal proceedings. The teens would be eligible to seek bond and stay in the country while they await their hearing. It can take people two years or more to have their formal interview to determine whether they are eligible for asylum. If the application is ultimately denied, the teens could still challenge deportation in immigration court.
Burundi, an East African nation of about 10 million people who speak the local Kirundi language and French, has faced sporadic violence in recent years. President Pierre Nkurunziza is traveling outside the country for the first time since a failed coup attempt in 2015, officials announced Thursday.
Nkurunziza is visiting neighboring Tanzania, home to tens of thousands of Burundian refugees who have fled deadly political violence. Hundreds of people have been killed, according to the United Nations, and rights groups accuse Burundi's security forces of abuses including killings and disappearances. Burundi's government often dismisses the allegations, saying they are based on false information supplied by the regime's opponents.

USDA suspends beef imports from Brazil,"June 23 (UPI) -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture has suspended all imports of fresh beef from Brazil over safety concerns.
Since March -- when several other countries issued a ban on Brazilian meat -- the United States has been inspecting 100 percent of all meat products arriving from Brazil. The USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service rejected 11 percent of fresh beef products, or 1.9 million pounds.
""That figure is substantially higher than the rejection rate of 1 percent of shipments from the rest of the world,"" the USDA said Thursday.
The meat was rejected out of health concerns, sanitary conditions and animal health issues.
Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue on Thursday announced the products intended for the U.S. market would be suspended until the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture takes corrective action. Brazil's government said it intends to fix the problem by suspending five facilities from shipping beef to the United States.
""Ensuring the safety of our nation's food supply is one of our critical missions, and it's one we undertake with great seriousness. Although international trade is an important part of what we do at USDA, and Brazil has long been one of our partners, my first priority is to protect American consumers,"" Perdue said.
In March, dozens of Brazilian government officials were suspended amid allegations that some of the country's largest meat processors had been selling rotten and salmonella-tainted meat for years.
Officials said food company employees oversaw a scheme that included bribing inspectors to allow the tainted meat to be served in public schools and exported to Europe. Brazil is the world's largest exporter of red meat.
The country's federal police, similar to the FBI in the United States, said raids on some of the largest meat producers uncovered some 30 instances of bribes being paid to officials. Some 33 government officials were suspended.
Investigators said employees at the food-processing giants JBS and BRF paid federal inspectors to ignore problems with meat. More than 1,100 agents were involved in Operation Weak Flesh raids.

"Treasury Sanctions 4 Chinese Entities, Targeting North Korea","* Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced Thursday that the US had imposed sanctions on four Chinese entities, including a Chinese bank, cutting them off from the US financial system for “supporting North Korean sanctions evasion,” pending a 60-day review period.
* The US Department of Treasury has alleged that the Bank of Dandong, along with two individuals and another separate entity, provided continued financial support for the government of North Korea. The Treasury Department alleges that the Bank of Dandong has been acting as a gateway for North Korea, providing the country access to the US financial system, as well as to international financial systems.
* Details released by the Treasury Department stated that the Bank of Dandong allegedly acted as a conduit for the North Korean government “by facilitating millions of dollars of transactions for companies involved in North Korea’s WMD and ballistic missile programs.”
“Today the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has found the Bank of Dandong to be a foreign financial institution of primary money laundering concern under section 311 of the USA Patriot Act. This bank has served as a gateway for North Korea to access the US and international financial systems, facilitating millions of dollars of transactions for companies involved in North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs…
The United States will not stand for such action…
This will require US banks to ensure that the bank of Dandong does not access the US financial system directly or indirectly through other foreign banks. This action reaffirms the Treasury department’s commitment to ensure that North Korea is cut off from the US financial system…
In addition, the Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control has sanctioned two individuals and one entity for their continued support of North Korea’s activities.”
* Despite the fact that the sanctions are being imposed on Chinese entities, Mnuchin noted that this move is not meant to target China. Instead, the US hopes the sanctions will maximize economic pressure on North Korea, according to Mnuchin.
“While today’s actions are directed at Chinese individuals and entities, we look forward to continuing working closely with the government of China to stop illicit financing involving North Korea. We are in no way targeting China with these actions. We will be meeting with China and other countries at the G20 [summit] next week to further our efforts to cut off North Korea’s illicit activities. North Korea’s provocative, destabilizing and inhumane behavior will not be tolerated. We are committed to targeting North Korea’s economic enablers and maximizing economic pressure on the regime until it ceases nuclear and ballistic missile programs. This is very significant since this is the first bank that we’ve cut off, under this.”
* The Office of Foreign Asset Control said Chinese citizens Sun Wei and Li Hong Ri, along with Dalian Global Unity Shipping Co., also are receiving sanctions for their alleged financial support of North Korea.
* The Department of Treasury released details concerning the alleged the nature of financial support between these entities and North Korea.
“Sun Wei has been closely aligned with the U.S.-designated Foreign Trade Bank (FTB) in establishing and running a cover company on behalf of FTB. FTB is North Korea’s primary foreign exchange bank, and it was designated in 2013 for facilitating transactions on behalf of North Korea’s WMD proliferation network…
Li Hong Ri established several front companies used by Ri Song Hyok. Ri Song Hyok is a Beijing-based official for U.S.-designated Koryo Bank and U.S.-designated Koryo Credit Development Bank and has reportedly established front companies to procure items and conduct financial transactions on behalf of North Korea…
[Dalian Global Unity] — According to the 2013 report by the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea, Dalian Global Unity was actively involved in eight cases of luxury goods smuggling incidents and is suspected of involvement in at least one other case. Middlemen from Dalian Global Unity gave specific instructions about how shipments and transactions could evade the UN-mandated luxury goods ban.”
* Mnuchin did not specify whether the Chinese government had been given advanced notice before the US announced the sanctions.
* Cui Tiankai, China’s ambassador to the United States, told reporters that China disagreed with the US’ decision to sanction these Chinese individuals and entities:
“We are enforcing all [of] the UN Security Council resolutions. If there’s any evidence that any Chinese company or individual or entity violates such a resolution, we will conduct our own investigation and pursue the cases in accordance with our own law. But we’re against this long-arm jurisdiction by the USA.”
“While we will continue to seek international cooperation on North Korea, the United States is sending an emphatic message across the globe that we will not hesitate to take action against persons, companies and financial institutions who enable this regime.”
* The Treasury placed the entities on its Specially Designated Nationals List — meaning each entity’s “assets are blocked and US persons are generally prohibited from dealing with them.”
* This section, which is designated as an anti-laundering act, “authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to require domestic financial institutions and domestic financial agencies to take certain special measures against foreign financial institutions, classes of international transactions, or types of accounts of primary money laundering concern.”
* In 2005, the Treasury designated another Chinese financial institution, Bank of Delta Asia, as a primary concern for money laundering under Section 311 of the Patriot Act.
* At the time, Stuart Levey, the Treasury’s Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said:
“Bank of Delta Asia has been a willing pawn for the North Korean government to engage in corrupt financial activities through Macau, a region that needs significant improvement in its money laundering controls.”
* As mentioned, Mnuchin said the new sanctions are intended to increase economic pressure on North Korea, a regime that Mnuchin described as “provocative and inhumane.”
* Earlier this month, following the death of 22-year-old American student Otto Warmbier, President Donald Trump tweeted:
While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 20, 2017
* Anthony Ruggiero, a former official in the Treasury’s Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, told The New York Times:
“This is the tip of the iceberg. We know there are more Chinese banks that are either wittingly or unwittingly assisting North Korea.”
* Ruggerio continued, arguing that the sanctions against the Bank of Dandong “will make reputable Western banks ask questions about larger financial institutions in China.”
* William Newcomb —a former member of the UN sanctions panel on North Korea — told Foreign Policy in 2016:
“You have designated entities that have continued to operate in China. It’s not an accident. China’s security services are good enough to know who is doing what.”
* No evidence has been presented to support the the claim that China is aware of institutions that have been working with North Korea.
* Bonnie Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Vox:
“This is an effort by the Trump administration to get China to apply more pressure. Part of it is reputational — this is a signal that the US is not happy about what China is doing.
But more importantly, it is an effort to begin to address the way that the North Korean regime and its military is getting access to funds, because they are conducting illicit activities thorough these entities in China.”
* Zhao Tong, a fellow at the nuclear policy program at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Centre for Global Policy in Beijing, told The New York Times:
“I think major state-owned banks and shipping companies have strictly implemented the sanctions, but the smaller ones still seek opportunities to make money wherever they can.”
North Korea’s import partners:
North Korea’s export partners:
* According to Richard Haass, the Council of Foreign Relations President, the China views its relationship with North Korea with a sense of tense necessity:
“Chinese leaders have no love for Kim Jong-un’s regime or its nuclear weapons, but it dislikes even more the prospect of North Korea’s collapse and the unification of the Korean Peninsula with Seoul as the capital.”
* When asked if China was disappointed by the announcement of the sanctions, Cui Tiankai, China’s ambassador the the US, responded:
“We are always aware that there are some negative things in the relationship. So as I said earlier, our job is to make sure the positive developments will be overwhelming. And we will continue to do our best to keep the relations on the right track.”

"Minutes Ago Trump Walked Up To Marine, Locked Eyes, Then Did Something HEART STOPPING","The already Viral video (see below) of President Trump helping out a Marine when his hat blew off in the wind, shows us not just that the President is a person with a heart, but that he does not see a distinction between himself and others.
The modern politician is one part vampire and two parts sociopath. They lack empathy and only engage with the real people of this country when they need you to vote for them. they see themselves as a different class of people to us “little folk”, and this is why they can talk about grand moral schemes without considering the real impact it will have on everyday people.
President Trump distinguishes himself, not only in his ability to connect with people but by his empathy and willingness to help. Could you in a million years imagine a Clinton or an Obama stopping to help out someone like this?
When 2020 comes around, it won’t be Donald Trump’s policies or political endeavors that get him re-elected, it will b his humanity. It will be the personal touches in everything he does, and most importantly, it will be because we, the People, know that there is at least one person on the political stage that considers us as human beings.
CNN will probably headline the following video with the following: Trump forces Marine to wear hat despite resistance. That’s not what really happened, though. Check this out and watch the video below.
You got to love President Trump. He found the Marine’s hat and then picks it up and puts it back on him. Watch the amazing video below.
God bless our Marines. President Trump really cares about our men and women in uniform and makes it a point to show it every moment he can.

Florida man sues Florida for people's right to smoke marijuana,"July 7 (UPI) -- Florida trial attorney John Morgan filed a lawsuit against the state of Florida after lawmakers banned the use of smoked marijuana in the state's medical marijuana law.
More than 70 percent of Floridians voted in favor of a medical marijuana amendment in November 2016. The success of the amendment was due in part to Morgan, who funded the campaign to get the amendment on the ballot that year.
But the Republican-led Florida legislature wrote a medical marijuana law in March with restrictions that many activists like Morgan disagree with, including the prohibition of smoked marijuana.
In his lawsuit and in public comments, Morgan has accused Florida lawmakers of pretending to be doctors, despite no medical training.
""By redefining the constitutionally defined term 'medical use' to exclude smoking, the Legislature substitutes its medical judgment for that of 'a licensed Florida physician' and is in direct conflict with the specifically articulated Constitutional process,"" the lawsuit states.
Elsewhere in the lawsuit, Morgan points out the benefits of smoked marijuana as noted by physicians.
""Scientists have already discovered over one-hundred separate cannabinoids through medical marijuana research, which have the potential to induce positive biologic changes in the body's cannabinoid receptor system,"" the suit states. ""Inhalation is a medically effective and efficient way to deliver Tetrahydrocannabinol, and other cannabinoids, to the bloodstream.""
The amendment that passed in November allowed lawmakers to restrict the physical act of smoking marijuana, which they then did in January by prohibiting it altogether. But Morgan argues that the intent of that allowance in the original amendment language was to let lawmakers create rules around the act of smoking, such as whether one can smoke in a public place, not to ban it altogether.
""The statement unambiguously says that smoking medical marijuana in a private place in compliance with the provisions of the amendment is legal,"" the suit states.
Republican State Rep. Ray Rodrigues, a sponsor of the smoking ban, said the smoking of medical marijuana would be a ""backdoor attempt at recreational"" use of marijuana.
He also said that the amendment allowed lawmakers to insert a smoking ban and if Morgan didn't want that to happen, he should have worded the amendment more carefully.
Morgan, who is sometimes rumored to be a potential gubernatorial candidate for 2018, sniped back.
""I don't know what [Rodrigues] does for a living, but I would never hire someone that dumb, that that's their deductive reasoning,"" Morgan said.",United Press International – US,0
Susan Rice Won’t Testify,"Joker 4 hours agoNews, Politics, USA, World50 Views
As they saw in the movies, the plot thickens. And with Susan Rice’s unexpected move the plot is as thick as pea soup.
According to Fox News, former National Security Advisor Susan Rice’s will not testify before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence as scheduled.
Her testimony, expected to be the most explosive in years on Capitol Hill has been postponed.
Her testimony, where she most likely would have indicted and convicted many members of Obama’s administration will not happen.
We want to know why and so does Republican Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who said,
“Let’s remember the American people want to get the truth on all these issues … on what Susan Rice may or may not have done.”
Rice was meant was to appear today in a closed session before the committee. She will not. Which is a disgrace.
The Committee is looking into Rice’s alleged crimes of improperly “unmasking” U.S. citizens who had communicated with foreigner government officials who were under US surveillance.
Rice originally told PBS, “I know nothing about this,” when they asked her point blank about her role in the unmaskings.
Later, however, she came clean and did in fact acknowledged she did ask for the names of Trump campaign members to be unmasked.
Fox News is claiming that there was no reason given for the cancellation of Rice’s testimony.
Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan last week told Fox News,
“The American people want to get the truth on all of these issues,” before adding questioning how Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch handled the whole sordid Clinton email investigation.
He also is demanding to know if Comey exposed classified information to get back at Trump for firing him as FBI director.

Speaking at a rally in Islamabad, the opposition leader said the judiciary’s ruling brought the country ‘a new hope’
Sune Engel Rasmussen in Islamabad
Sunday 30 July 2017 15.10 EDTLast modified on Sunday 30 July 2017 15.18 EDT
Pakistan’s opposition leader, Imran Khan, has called for a future of “real democracy” in the country, following the dismissal of Nawaz Sharif as prime minister over corruption charges.
“We are thankful to the judiciary because with their judgment, they brought us a new hope,” Khan told a gathering of thousands of supporters on Sunday.
The rally in Islamabad was a triumphant celebration for the heartthrob-cricketer-turned-populist-politician, who, since last year, has led a campaign to oust Sharif.
Imran Khan on the Panama Papers: ‘The coalition of the corrupt help each other’
Friday’s ruling by Pakistan’s highest court disrupted what had otherwise looked like a smooth path to next year’s election for Sharif’s PML-N party.
Former oil minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi will most likely be approved as interim prime minister on Tuesday, at a special session in the 342-member parliament, where the ruling PML-N party holds a strong majority.
Abbasi will hold the position for less than two months, until Shahbaz Sharif, younger brother of the ousted prime minister, is confirmed in parliament and can take over.
Thousands of supporters from Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e Insaf (PTI) party congregated at Islamabad’s parade ground on Sunday for what had been termed a “thanksgiving day”, the latest of Khan’s signature rallies that have helped him drum up popular support.
In front of flag-flying party cadres dressed in the red and green colours of PTI, among towers of loudspeakers blasting music, Khan likened Pakistan’s rulers to “mafia who safeguard personal interests at any cost”.
“When we decided to move against Nawaz in the Panama case, everyone said it was a mistake because in the past, the powerful and mighty ones have been protected. But today I salute the court for giving hope to people for a new Pakistan,” he said.
Since his political ascension in 2011, after 15 years in politics, Khan has drawn support particularly from educated urbanites disillusioned with their political elites.
“Imran Khan is fighting hard to let people know their political rights and their role in society. He has been a true example,” said Syed Ishfaq, face painted red and green, who had travelled to the capital from Peshawar to participate in the celebration.
Last year, Khan received a timely boost with the leak of the so-called Panama Papers, giving credence to his attacks against the political establishment, whom he has called “the coalition of the corrupt”.
After the leak, Khan filed a constitutional petition to have the supreme court investigate the purchase of high-end London property through offshore companies in the name of Sharif’s children, then minors.
He organised street protests and demanded a “lockdown” of Islamabad until the country’s highest court ordered an inquiry into the PM.
Sharif, though, was not dismissed for actual corruption but for being deemed dishonest, according to the constitution’s article 62, over unreported income of about £2,000 from a Dubai-based company owned by his son. Sharif claims he never received the salary.
However, he has not completely dodged a corruption verdict. In its ruling, the supreme court ordered a criminal investigation by an accountability court into the Sharif family based on materials from the Panama Papers.
The ouster of Sharif has highlighted the decades-long fractious relationship between the now ex-prime minister and the military. There has been speculation that the court, with its verdict, simply did the military’s bidding, and that Khan was a handy tool for the generals to cut down a prime minister with whom they have feuded for decades. Khan’s supporters dismissed that idea.
“If Imran Khan was really a puppet of the military, he would have become prime minister,” said Ishfaq, referring to a claim by Khan that former army chief Pervez Musharraf offered him the position.
Friday’s court decision sparked hope among demonstrators that the country’s corrupt leaders can be held accountable.
However, the appointment of Nawaz’s younger brother as new prime minister does little to accommodate equally forceful complaints that the Sharif family holds a dynastic grip on power.
“This is is not a democracy but monarchy. It is not a meritocracy. And that is why Pakistan has been left behind developed nations,” Khan said from the stage.
Razmat Khan, a supporter, agreed: “Shahbaz is the same as Nawaz. They just want to keep power in the family.”
Supporters of Sharif point out that during his tenure, the economy has grown and security has improved markedly.
According to the government, growth reached 5.28% last year. The number of civilians killed in terrorist attacks has dropped from about 3,000 in 2013, when Sharif came into office, to 612 in 2016.
“I would give a bit of credit to Nawaz Sharif,” said Ishfaq. “But it is the law enforcement agencies that have brought peace.”
Yet, the improvements are tenuous. Violence has recently resurged in a string of attacks by the Pakistan Taliban and Islamic State, which constitutes a moderate but growing threat in Pakistan.
Economic growth is held up by a swelling account deficit, and an overvalued currency is hampering exports. Growth has also not seeped down to the lower classes who make up the majority of the nation of more than 200 million people.
“Thousands are jobless. There is no unemployment plan, and no economic policy except securing kickbacks,” said Sheraz Hassan, who drove his three children on a motorbike to the gathering.
Many of the celebrating Khan supporters hoped that Pakistan had turned a page.
“The prime minister of Pakistan has been brought to justice,” said Ishfaq. “That is very rare.”",The Guardian – World,0
Mattis Orders Full Review Of Any Military Training That Has Nothing To Do With Warfighting,"Secretary of Defense James Mattis has ordered a full review of any military training not directly relevant to warfighting.
Mattis told the services to conduct a review of the “requirements for mandatory force training that does not directly support core tasks,” according to a Friday memo obtained by Military Times.
In other words, Mattis wants a full examination of all the hours of burdensome, irrelevant training service members have to undergo before deployment.
“I want to verify that our military policies also support and enhance warfighting readiness and force lethality,” Mattis said.
Mattis also asked for a review into what should be done about permanently non-deployable service members.
The memo states that the review will be headed by a working group under the Pentagon’s undersecretary for personnel and readiness, a position currently occupied by Anthony M. Kurta. While President Donald Trump recently tapped Robert Wilkie for the job, Wilkie has not yet been confirmed by the Senate.
Mattis has recently involved himself in various personnel issues, particularly by encouraging Congress to block an amendment by GOP Rep. Vicky Hartzler to the annual defense budget bill that would have prevented Department of Defense funds from being used to pay for transgender medical treatments. Hartzler’s amendment failed after 24 Republicans voted against it.
Recommendations from the new review Mattis has set in motion are due by Dec. 1, 2018.
During his presidential campaign, Trump spoke to a veterans’ group in Oct. 2016 and said “we’re gonna get away from political correctness” in response to a question about social engineering in the military.
“But you’re right, we have a politically correct military and it’s getting more and more politically correct every day. And a lot of the great people in this room don’t even understand how it’s possible to do that.” he said.

Newt Gingrich penned an explosive article the Monday morning, putting special counsel Robert Mueller on blast for filling “his presidential hunting expedition with liberal lawyers.”
Gingrich highlighted the fact that yet another Democrat donor has been added to Mueller’s investigative team- Elizabeth Prelogar, an attorney in the Office of the Solicitor General who has given a total of $750 to Obama and Hillary presidential campaigns. According to Gingrich, she joins four other attorneys on the team who have donated over $50,000 combined to Democrat campaigns.
But that’s not all, he notes two important numbers that also bolster the idea of Mueller’s Democratic bias:
* Department of Justice employees gave $286,797 to the Clinton campaign in 2016, and a mere $8,756 to Trump.
* Mueller was a partner at WilmerHale law firm before being appointed special counsel. Employees from this law firm donated a collective $326,798 to Clinton in 2016 and $628 to Trump. Mueller has also been recruiting lawyers from this firm to work on the Trump investigation.
Three of Mueller’s seven identified attorney’s have worked for both the DOJ and WilmerHale. The other four come from other federal agencies. Gingrich asks an important question:

Conservatives have HAD IT with this Fox News host’s treatment of President Trump,"DemocratsNews and PoliticsTrump Train
 
Victor Medina1 min ago
Fox News may be “fair and balanced,” but one on-air anchor has been decidedly anti-Trump for some time. And conservatives are sick of it.
We’ve seen how some mainstream media members let their egos skew their news reporting, and it seems Fox News’ Shephard Smith has now joined their ranks. In truth, Smith has been an irritating blowhard for years. Since Donald Trump was elected President, however, Smith has ratcheted up his over-opinionated rhetoric.
The Washington Times reports that Smith went on a tirade Friday over President Trump and the supposed “Russia” scandal. With fellow anchor Chris Wallace appearing on his show to discuss it, Smith bought into every Democratic talking point, and then said something most mainstream media anchors haven’t stooped to say.
“We’re still not clean on this, Chris,” Smith said. “Why all these lies? Why is it lie after lie after lie? If you [are] clean, come on clean….the deception, Chris, is mind-boggling, and there are still people out there who believe we’re making it up — and one day they’re going to realize we’re not.”
The Gateway Pundit reported on the conservative response to his statements. Spoiler: folks aren’t happy.
Shephard Smith may not be Barack Obama’s biggest fan, but he never showed the same level of disdain for the Democratic president as he now does for Trump. Conservatives are taking note of that.

Prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty against a Guantanamo Bay detainee accused of orchestrating the deadly 2002 Bali nightclub bombings in Indonesia and other attacks, a U.S. military official said Wednesday.
The detainee known by the single name Hambali was notified last week that prosecutors are preparing to try him before a military commission at the U.S. base in Cuba on charges that include terrorism and murder in violation of the law of war. He is accused of conspiring with leaders of al-Qaida in a series of attacks, including the bombings in Bali in October 2002 that killed 202 people.
A Pentagon legal official known as the convening authority must still approve the charges before the case can proceed to an arraignment.
Marine Corps Brig. Gen. John Baker, the chief defense counsel, said in an email that he was notified that prosecutors do not intend to seek the death penalty even though some of the charges are potentially capital offenses.
Baker said he would be submitting a request for additional resources to ""effectively represent"" Hambali but the decision to not seek the death penalty means he will not have to find experienced capital attorneys. Such lawyers are typically civilians.
The chief prosecutor did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press and the rationale for the decision was not publicly known.
There are two military commission death penalty cases pending at Guantanamo and both have been bogged down for years in pretrial litigation. One case involves five men charged with planning and aiding the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack. The other is for the alleged mastermind of the deadly October 2000 bombing attack on the USS Cole in Yemen. Both have stalled largely due to issues related to the fact that the defendants were held for years in clandestine CIA facilities and subjected to treatment now widely regarded as torture.
Any trial of Hambali, whose full name is Encep Nurjamen, would involve similar issues. The 53-year-old Indonesian was also held by the CIA and also subjected to what the U.S. government has called its ""enhanced"" interrogation program.
He is accused of being the ""operational mastermind"" of the Southeast Asia-based Islamic extremist group known as Jemaah Islamiyah, an affiliate of al-Qaida. Charging documents provided to the AP allege he orchestrated the Bali bombings, whose death toll included seven U.S. citizens, as well as an August 2003 attack on the J.W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta, which killed 11 people, and other plots.
Hambali is one of 41 prisoners still held at Guantanamo. If the case against him moves forward, he would be the first charged since President Donald Trump took office.

Vladimir Putin expels 755 US diplomats from Russia and threatens further action over sanctions,"Russian President Vladimir Putin attends the Navy Day parade in St. PetersburgCredit:Reuters
31 July 2017 • 1:17am
Vladimir Putin on Sunday said the United States would have to cut 755 diplomatic staff in Russia and warned of a prolonged gridlock in its ties after the US Congress backed new sanctions against the Kremlin.
The Russian president added bluntly that Russia was able to raise the stakes with America even further, although he hoped this would be unnecessary.
A US State Department official denounced the move as a ""regrettable and uncalled for act,"" adding that Washington was now weighing a potential response.
On Friday, the Russian foreign ministry demanded Washington cut its diplomatic presence in Russia by September 1 to 455 people - the same number Moscow has in the US.

""More than a thousand people - diplomats and technical personnel - were working and are still working"" at the US embassy and consulates, Mr Putin said in an interview with Rossia-24 television.
""755 people must stop their activities in Russia.""
The US State Department would not confirm the number of US officials serving at the mission.
Mr Putin added that an upturn in Russia's relations with Washington could not be expected ""any time soon.""
""We have waited long enough, hoping that the situation would perhaps change for the better,"" he said.
""But it seems that even if the situation is changing, it's not for any time soon.""
Mr Putin warned that Russia could further ratchet up the pressure, but he hoped this would not be needed.
Russia still ""has things to say and is able to further restrict areas of common activities, which may be sensitive for the American side,"" he said.

If the damage inflicted by ""attempts to pressure Russia"" rises further, ""we are able to look at other forms of retaliation. But I hope we won't have to do it,"" he said.
""For the time being, I am against"" any additional riposte, Mr Putin said.
On Thursday, the US Senate overwhelmingly approved a bill to toughen sanctions on Russia for allegedly meddling in the 2016 US presidential election and for its annexation of Crimea in 2014.
The law now goes to President Donald Trump who had made an improvement in ties with Russia a plank of his election campaign - a position that his critics said was inexplicable.
As of 2013, the US mission in Russia, including the Moscow embassy and consulates in St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Vladivostok, employed 1,279 staff, according to a State Department Inspector General's report that year. That included 934 ""locally employed"" staff and 301 US ""direct-hire"" staff, from 35 US government agencies, the report said.
That breakdown suggested the actual number of Americans forced to leave Russia would be far less than 755.
""We don't have 755 American diplomats in Russia,"" said Michael McFaul, a former US ambassador to Russia, in a post on Twitter on Sunday.
Are we sure 755 Americans will be leaving? We didn't have that many Americans in the entire embassy when I was there . https://t.co/80rTZU7OP4
— Michael McFaul (@McFaul) July 30, 2017
The cuts would likely affect how quickly the United States is able to process Russian applications for U.S. visas, McFaul said.
""If these cuts are real, Russians should expect to wait weeks if not months to get visas to come to U.S.,"" he said.
Russia also froze two US embassy compounds - a Moscow summer house and a storage facility in the city - from August 1.
""I thought that we should show that we too are not going to stand by without a response"" after ""the baseless measures taken by the American side,"" Mr Putin said.
In December, then US president Barack Obama ordered out 35 Russian diplomats and closed down two embassy summer houses that Washington said were being used by Moscow for espionage.
At the time, the Kremlin said it would put any retaliation on hold until after Trump took office.
High on the list of US grievances is the allegation that Russian operatives hacked Democratic Party computers at the peak of the troubled 2016 election campaign.
Mr Putin on Sunday said Russia had proposed ""several times establishing cooperation with the American side"" on cyber-security.
""But instead of starting to work constructively, all we hear are baseless accusations about interference in the internal affairs of the United States,"" he complained.
Mr Putin and Mr Trump, meeting on the sidelines of the July 7-8 G20 summit in Hamburg, talked about setting up what Trump called an ""impenetrable cyber security unit"" to prevent hacking in future elections.
Senior members of Trump's Republican Party poured scorn on the concept.
Lindsey Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the notion was ""not the dumbest idea I've ever heard, but it's pretty close.""
Former presidential candidate John McCain said sarcastically he was ""sure that Vladimir Putin could be of enormous assistance in that effort, since he's doing the hacking.""

Germany Demands China’s Release of Imprisoned Catholic Bishop,"The German ambassador to China demanded that Chinese authorities release a Catholic bishop whom they have secretly held in captivity for over a year.
Ambassador Michael Clauss said that Bishop Peter Shao Zumin, who disappeared in September 2016 after the death of his predecessor, is alive and well. Government officials forced Zumin, whom the Chinese government refuses to recognize as a bishop despite his appointment by the Pope, to move four times in the last year to secret locations, according to an AP report.
“His full freedom of movement should be restored,” Clauss said in a statement posted on the embassy’s website.
While initial reports stated that Zumin was confined to his home, Vatican-affiliated Asia News reported that Zumin never actually arrived at his house and is believed to be held at yet another secret location, possibly within his diocese of Wenzhou where he was last seen in the company of government officials. The government’s secret detainment of Zumin is believed to be part of an effort to force the bishop to join the Communist Party controlled Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association as a power play against the Vatican.
Beijing’s refusal to recognize Zumin’s status, since the Chinese government has been at odds with the Vatican over who has the authority to name bishops since the 1950s when China broke all relations with the Vatican. China recently ramped up antagonism toward its local churches according to Clauss who said he was disturbed by “a number of new rules” drafted to regulate religious freedom within the country.
Clauss referred to the Religious Affairs Regulations Draft Revisions, published in 2016, which have yet to be officially adopted by the Chinese government. The draft includes a regulation that would require religious institutions to conform to requirements for urban planning, which some activists fear could be used as justification to remove crosses and other religious iconography.
“If unchanged, they could place further restrictions on the right to freedom of religion and belief,” Clauss said.

‘It’s not a RompHim!’: Seth Meyers torches Don Jr for saying meeting happened before Russia was ‘en vogue’,"18 Jul 2017 at 00:22 ET
Seth Meyers and RompHim (Screengrab / Instagram)
Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story!
Seth Meyers on Monday caught up on last week’s insane avalanche of Donald Trump news, paying particular attention to revelations involving the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and his meeting with a Russian emissary.
Speaking about the president’s attempts Monday to distract from the growing Russia scandal, Meyers noted that Trump spent “Made in America” day pretending to drive a firetruck as White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and Vice President Mike Pence looked on.
“At this point, Sean Spicer is just an exhausted dad trying to keep up with his frenetic toddler,” Meyers said.
The “Late Night” host then turned to the president’s son, Trump Jr., and his interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. During that interview, Trump Jr. tried to downplay his meeting with a Russian lawyer, and insisted—incorrectly—that every element of that meeting was in the public view. Trump Jr. also claimed the clandestine congregation was before “Russiamania” was “en vogue.”
“En vogue?” Meyers asked. “It’s a criminal conspiracy to meddle in an election, not a RompHim.”

"Teen father arrested after leaving 16-day-old son in parking lot, police say","CBS/APJuly 25, 2017, 8:33 PM
 
Last Updated Jul 25, 2017 8:50 PM EDT
SUISUN CITY, Calif. -- A newborn was in critical but stable condition Tuesday after his teenage father abandoned him in a Northern California strip-mall parking lot, police said.
The father, Daniel Mitchell, 18, drove into the lot in Suisun City on Monday, removed a car seat holding the 16-day-old boy, put it on the ground and left, police said after viewing surveillance video and interviewing witnesses.
Employees at a nearby barbershop told officers that they first noticed a baby carrier, and after investigating further, realized a child was inside, CBS San Francisco reports.
After speaking to witnesses and reviewing surveillance video from the area, officers identified the suspect as 18-year-old suspect and the vehicle's license plate, the station writes.
Surveillance footage shows a baby left outside in a strip-mall parking lot on Mon., July 24, 2017, in Suisun City, Calif.

He was involved in a hit-and-run crash and hospitalized later Monday in nearby Fairfield, and police found him there and confirmed he was the father.
Police arrested Mitchell on suspicion of child endangerment, child abandonment, committing a felony while free on bail and misdemeanor possession of suspected cocaine.
Police said they have found and interviewed the boy's mother, but she is not considered a suspect.
The baby was airlifted to a children's hospital.
The infant was released from the hospital and placed in protective custody.
Anyone with information about the case is asked to contact Detective Sousa at (707) 421-7361 or Solano County Crime Stoppers at (707) 644-7867.

ACLU sues Trump alleging election commission lacks transparency,"FILE PHOTO: A ballot is placed into a locked ballot box by a poll worker as people line-up to vote early at the San Diego County Elections Office in San Diego, California, U.S., November 7, 2016.
U.S. President Donald Trump waves as walks on the South Lawn of the White House upon his return to Washington, U.S., from the G20 Summit in Hamburg, July 8, 2017.
WASHINGTON The American Civil Liberties Union on Monday said it had filed a lawsuit against U.S. President Donald Trump's election commission, saying it had failed to follow federal law governing public access and transparency for such advisory groups.
The ACLU said in a statement that the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity had already held its first meeting without giving any notice or opening it to the public, and that its upcoming meeting would only be available via webcast. The commission last week said it would meet on July 19.

Woman's fatal encounter with Minneapolis cop shocks Australia,"CBS/APJuly 18, 2017, 7:47 AM
Justine Damond's fatal encounter with Minneapolis police shocks Australia
Justine Damond is seen in an undated family photo.
SYDNEY -- Half a world from where an Australian woman was shot dead by a Minneapolis police officer, Tuesday's front-page headline in her hometown Sydney newspaper summarized Australia's reaction in blunt terms: ""AMERICAN NIGHTMARE.""
In Justine Damond's native country, news of the meditation teacher's baffling death has dominated the airwaves, newspapers and websites for days, feeding into Australians' long-held fears about America's notorious culture of gun violence.
Family looks for answers after woman shot dead by police officer
Late Saturday night, a police officer in Minneapolis shot and killed 40-year-old Justine Damond, who called 911 to report a possible assault. The...
""The country is infested with possibly more guns than people,"" said Philip Alpers, a gun policy analyst with the University of Sydney who has studied the stark differences in gun laws between the nations. ""We see America as a very risky place in terms of gun violence - and so does the rest of the world.""
While police officers carry guns in Australia, deadly shootings by police are exceedingly rare; there are only a handful reported each year, according to the Australian Institute of Criminology. And though the U.S. doesn't keep a national database of deadly police-involved shootings, even incomplete statistics show there are hundreds every year.
America's reluctance to strengthen its gun regulations and its seemingly endless stream of shooting deaths have long been a source of confusion and concern in Australia, which instituted tough gun ownership laws in 1996 following a deadly mass shooting. At the time, then-Prime Minister John Howard -- a conservative -- warned Australians against following America's lead on gun control, saying: ""We have an opportunity in this country not to go down the American path.""
The Australian government's official travel advice to those heading to the U.S. specifically warns tourists to be on guard for gun crime, and urges Australians living in the U.S. to be familiar with ""active shooter"" training drills. Australian media coverage of America's frequent mass shootings is often tinged with disbelief -- ""another day, another shooting in America"" is a common refrain on newscasts.
The death of Damond, a 40-year-old meditation teacher who was reportedly dressed in her pajamas when she was shot by a police officer late Saturday, has sparked a similarly stunned reaction. The story has led network newscasts and was splashed across newspapers' front pages. Sydney's Daily Telegraph ran an editorial headlined ""A senseless and tragic death.""
Authorities have released no details on what prompted Saturday's shooting, which occurred after Damond called police to report what she believed to be an active sexual assault in an alley near her home.
A law enforcement source told CSB News' Pat Milton on Monday that it was still unclear why the officer had discharged his weapon. The officer apparently had his gun drawn when he and his partner arrived at the scene in their cruiser.
The driver's side window was open and the bullet traveled past the officer seated in the driver's seat and through the open window, the source told CBS News. It hit a woman standing at the window, but it wasn't clear whether the woman -- whom police have not formally identified as Damond -- was talking to the officers at the time or had just approached the window.
Damond's Sydney-based family issued a statement on Monday saying they were trying to come to terms with the tragedy and understand why it happened. On Tuesday, her father spoke out publicly for the first time.
""We thought yesterday was our worst nightmare, but we awoke to the ugly truth and it hurt even more,"" John Ruszczyk told reporters. ""Justine was a beacon to all of us. We only ask that the light of justice shine down on the circumstances of her death.""

"WATCH: Magazine Tells Teens To Have ‘Anal Sex,’ Mother-Of-10 Has A Better Idea","July 18, 2017That Conservative GirlU.S. News
Teen Vogue officially went beyond the pale with their June issue, which contained instructions explaining how to have anal sex, including depictions of homosexual intercourse. Again, this was an issue of Teen Vogue, a magazine for teenagers. A mother-of-10, who was rightfully outraged after learning what Teen Vogue was teaching their young reader base to do, has since gone viral with a video she posted on social media.
“Parents, I am asking you to go to your local gas stations, your local libraries and your local grocery stores and ask to speak to the manager, or preferably the owner, and demand that they remove Teen Vogue from their shelves immediately,” said Elizabeth Johnston in her viral video.
MOM BLOGGER BURNS TEEN VOGUE MAGAZINE!

“These editors’ brains are in the gutter. Now, let’s put their sales in the gutter where they belong,” the rightfully outraged mom declared. Johnston, who has a parenting blog called The Activist Mommy, then proceeded to rip up a copy of the magazine before tossing it into an outdoor fire pit.
Elizabeth Johnston, a mother of 10 who frequently comments on parenting issues through her blog, The Activist Mommy, is hoping to spark widespread backlash against a popular teen magazine with her latest social-media effort.
Johnston posted a video last week calling attention to the June issue of Teen Vogue, which she criticized for its focus on sexual content including instructions for anal sex and depictions of homosexual intercourse.
The video, which has received roughly 9 million views on Facebook as of this writing, ends with her tossing the magazine into a fire pit. [Source: Western Journalism]
Johnston appeared on CBN News on Monday to share her motivation for launching what she calls “Operation Pull Teen Vogue.”
“I was just so outraged when some parents sent me this article and I read it,” she explained. “As a mom who has 10 children myself and I’m always trying to protect my children from over-sexualization, I could not believe what I was reading. And the worst part about it was that here you have adults peddling this sexual information to minors, to children as young as 12 years old.”

Johnston shared a story from a man named William, who was successful at getting a store manager to remove Teen Vogue magazines from his shelves. “I went into my local Kroger, grabbed all 9 mags on the rack. I walked right up to the manager and asked him if he would allow his kids to read this,” wrote William. “No joke folks, he literally ripped them up and told his loss prevention team to write them off as stolen. I’m now shopping there for the rest of my life.”
Teens should not be having any type of sexual intercourse, much less anal sex, which is medically dangerous even for adults. If anything, magazines targeted at an adolescent audience should be warning teenagers about the dangers of premarital sex, not encouraging them to try any and all forms of sexual debauchery.
Parents, do not allow your children to read Teen Vogue, and share this report so that others will be alerted to the agenda this magazine is pushing on kids as young as 11 years old.

Trump EPA Radically Downsizes Partisan ‘Board Of Scientific Counselors’,"President Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency has made drastic cuts to an intra-agency board responsible for rubber-stamping a number of former President Barack Obama’s climate regulations, informing about 75 percent of its members that their contracts will not be renewed in August.
“Members of the EPA’s Board of Scientific Counselors (BOSC) whose terms end in August will not see them renewed, according to an email sent to members,” The Washington Post reported Tuesday. “(F)ive meetings of subcommittees of the board, planned for the late summer and the fall, will now be canceled because of lack of membership.”
The email was reportedly written by Robert Kavlock, the acting administrator for the Office of Research and Development. Only 11 of the board’s 49 members were expected to remain by September.
This does not mean that the former members are necessarily out of a job or that the board is dead.
“EPA is grateful for the service of all BOSC members, past and present, and has encouraged those with expiring terms to reapply,” agency spokeswoman Amy Graham said in a statement. “We are taking an inclusive approach to filling future BOSC appointments and welcome all applicants from all relevant scientific and technical fields.”
Many suspect nevertheless that the EPA’s sudden announcement was driven by desire to rid the board of Obama-era officials whose views on climate change are not consistent with those of the president.
“Most of us on the council are academic people,” former board member Ponisseril Somasundaran, a chemist at Columbia University, told The New York Times. “I think they want to bring in business and industry people.”
Others argue that the administration simply wants to make the board more balanced so that climate-change regulations are not rubber-stamped willy-nilly at the expense of the economy.
“In recent years, SAB experts have become nothing more than rubber stamps who approve all of the EPA’s regulations,” Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said during a House hearing four months ago.
“The EPA routinely stacks this board with friendly scientists who receive millions of dollars in grants from the federal government. The conflict of interest here is clear.”
A witness brought in by Smith said the board had a history of rejecting industry studies whose results didn’t fit in with the members’ beliefs.
“We have also seen situations where peer reviewers have suggested discounting a study solely based on the funding source, without any considerations being given to the quality of the study,” said Kimberly White, senior director of chemical products and technology at the American Chemistry Council.
“Also, EPA staff often comment throughout peer review meetings, essentially participating as peers, while industry experts are typically excluded from the dialogue.”",WesternJournalism,1
"Sean Spicer Just Started A Fight With CNN’s Jim Acosta, And It’s F*cking Disgraceful (DETAILS)","GooglePinterestDiggLinkedin Reddit Stumbleupon PrintDeliciousPocketTumblr
It’s no secret that CNN – and one of its most critical members, Jim Acosta, is no fan of Donald Trump and his corrupt, incompetent administration. No media network has gone after the Trump administration as viciously, especially after Trump ramped up his “fake news” attacks against the network.
Subscribe to our Youtube Channel
Despite the bullying from the Trump administration, CNN and Acosta have refused to back down. CNN’s chief White House correspondent has become an absolute nightmare for WH Press Secretary Sean Spicer during briefings, because Acosta asks all the questions Spicer doesn’t want want to answer – and he doesn’t back down.
In response to the pressure that Acosta has been putting on him in the briefing room, Spicer has just publicly attacked Acosta and is trying to pit the rest of the free press against the CNN correspondent. In a Washington Post piece on Acosta, Spicer spoke out against the reporter, calling him fame-hungry and dishonest. Spicer said:
If Jim Acosta reported on Jim Acosta the way he reports on us, he’d say he hasn’t been very honest. I think he’s gone well beyond the role of reporter and steered into the role of advocate. He’s the prime example of a [reporter in a] competitive, YouTube, click-driven industry.”
To make this attack even more desperate, Spicer actually tried to get other members of the media to help him make Acosta take it easy on him and “knock it off.”
He’s recognized that if you make a spectacle on the air then you’ll get more airtime and more clicks. . . . If I were a mainstream, veteran reporter, I’d be advocating for him to knock it off. It’s hurting the profession.”
Sorry Spicer, but the questions that Acosta is trying to get you to answer are the same things that every reporter – and every American – want to know. He’s just not afraid to corner you. Acosta responded, and defended his work in the feature. Acosta said:
I think I’m just covering a story, honestly. When the president of the United States calls the press ‘fake news’ and ‘the enemy of the American people,’ I think that’s when you have to get tough and ask the hard questions.”
Exactly. The Trump administration crossed the line when it accused main members of the free press of being “fake news” – and Spicer crossed another line by trying to make the free go against CNN and Acosta. It was a pathetic attempt to take the heat off of Trump and the administration, and there’s no way in hell the media is going to comply. If Trump has united the country on anything, it’s that he and his administration have got to go.

"Lalu Yadav scams: From railway hotel to fodder, all big cases in which RJD chief, family are accused","Former Bihar CM Lalu Yadav is in fresh trouble over alleged irregularities he did as railway minister.
The scam taint on former Bihar Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav is not ending. Now, some of his family members are also accused of corruption and facing investigations by the CBI and Income Tax department in several cases. On Friday, CBI registered a fresh case against Lalu and his family members for an alleged act of corruption he did as the Railway minister. The former Bihar CM has accused the Centre of running a conspiracy against him as he is fighting to dislodge the BJP from power. Talking to reporters, Lalu attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and RSS for targeting him and his family.
While the law will take its own course, we take a look at some of the big cases in which Lalu and his family members are accused.
Railway hotel scam: CBI today registered a case of irregularities allegedly carried out by Lalu Yadav when he was railway minister in 2006. CBI also raided at 12 locations linked to Lalu and his family members including in Patna, New Delhi, Ranchi and Gurgaon. CBI alleged that there were alleged irregularities in the tender for development, maintenance and operation of BNR Hotels in Ranchi and Puri, awarded to the private Sujata Hotels in 2006, PTI reported.
BNR Hotels are heritage hotels of the Indian Railways. They were taken over by the IRCTC from Indian Railways earlier in 2006. CBI also accused that Lalu had received 3 acres of land in exchange for awarding the tender to a private company. Other accused in the case are his wife Rabri Devi, Bihar Deputy Chief Minister and his son Tejaswi, the then IRCTC MD, P K Goyal, the wife of Yadav’s confidante Prem Chand Gupta, Sarla, and others.
Fodder scam: Fodder Scam case dates back to mid-1990s and involves embezzlement of around Rs 1000 crore from the Bihar government treasury during Lalu’s tenure as Bihar CM between 1990-97. Lalu was convicted on September 30, 2013, along with 44 others by a CBI court in the fodder scam. In 2014, the Jharkhand High Court quashed four pending fodder scam cases against Lalu Yadav on the grounds that a person convicted in one case could not be tried in similar cases based on same witnesses and evidence.
However, the Supreme Court on May 8, 2017, revived the fodder scam case. The SC also ordered a separate trial of each offence or four cases registered against the former Bihar CM.

Benami properties: On June 20, the Income Tax department released a list of all the properties of the former Bihar Chief Minister’s relatives seized by it. The I-T department attached as many as 12 properties belonging to Lalu’s relatives. These allegedly belong to Lalu’s daughter Misa Bharti and her husband Shailesh Kumar, Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tejashwi Yadav and ex-chief minister Rabri Devi, and sisters Ragini and Chanda Yadav. The attached properties also included a farmhouse in Delhi and a bungalow in New Friends Colony, ANI reported. The market value of these properties is believed to be around Rs 175 crore while their book value is Rs 9.32 crore, ANI reported.
Rs 8000 crore-money laundering case: In May, ED had arrested a Chartered Accountant associated with a company linked to Lalu’s daughter Misa Bharti in connection with an alleged money laundering to the tune of Rs 8000 crore, according to IE.
LIVE updates: Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, RSS behind searches, says RJD chief
Case against Tejashwi Yadav: Lalu’s younger son Tejashwi Yadav is also accused of holding heavy stakes in a company promoting Bihar’s biggest mall worth Rs 750 crore.
Case against Tej Pratap: Lalu’s elder son Tej Pratap is accused of illegally holding big tracts of land and petrol pump.
Case against Misa, Hema and Ragini: Lalu’s three daughters are accused of being directors in several shell companies.
According to Hindustan Times, Lalu Yadav is also accused of taking lands of some senior RJD leaders for giving them ministerial berths and also from common people for giving them jobs when he was the railway minister. The land plots were gifted to Lalu’s sons.",Financial Express,0
"Kelly is Trump's ""star"" secretary, now WH chief of staff","FILE - In this June 6, 2017, file photo, Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington.

July 28, 2017 10:13 PM
Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly may need to find and strap on some armor.
The battle-hardened, outspoken commander's new mission is to steady the roiling Trump administration — and quiet the friendly fire — as White House chief of staff.
""He has been a true star of my administration,"" the president tweeted Friday, announcing that his current secretary of homeland security was in, and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus was out. Trump called Kelly a ""great leader"" and ""great American."" He called Priebus a ""good man.""
If loyalty is indeed what Trump wants, he gets it in Kelly. He also gets a veteran of three tours in Iraq and a survivor of a family tragedy.
As Homeland Security secretary, Kelly has taken the lead on some of Trump's most controversial policies, including his executive orders suspending the admission of refugees and temporarily barring visitors from several Muslim-majority nations. Those orders have been stripped down by courts pending a Supreme Court review this fall.
People who know Kelly told The Associated Press that he was not aware of the details of the initial orders until around the time that Trump signed it. Yet, just days after taking office, he had to lead the agency as it dealt with the chaos and confusion that ensued at airports in the U.S. and around the world. He defended the orders to reporters and lawmakers and insisted he indeed had been part of the decision-making process.
Since joining the Marine Corps in 1970, Kelly carved out a reputation as a highly respected, but often outspoken commander who could roil debate and issue unpopular directives on issues ranging from women in combat to the treatment of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention center.
But the man chosen by Trump to lead his sniping administration holds a more somber distinction. Kelly is the highest-ranking officer to lose a child in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan. Kelly's son, Marine 1st Lt. Robert Kelly, was killed in November 2010 in Afghanistan.
That status, as part of what the military calls a Gold Star family, puts him in the administration of a presidential candidate who verbally attacked a Gold Star family: the Khans, Muslim-American immigrants who lost a son in Iraq and had criticized Trump at the Democratic National Convention.
Kelly retired this year, wrapping up a three-year post as head of U.S. Southern Command, which spanned some of the more fractious debate over the Obama administration's ultimately failed attempt to close Guantanamo.
Kelly was the fifth person to lead the Department of Homeland Security, which includes agencies that protect the president, respond to disasters, enforce immigration laws, protect the nation's coastlines and secure air travel. His selection as secretary of the agency bolstered concerns about an increase in military influence in a Trump White House.
In his final Pentagon news conference, Kelly spoke about the loss of his son — a topic he didn't often discuss publicly.
""To lose a child is — I can't imagine anything worse than that. I used to think, when I'd go to all of my trips up to Bethesda, Walter Reed, I'll go to the funerals with the secretaries of defense, that I could somehow imagine what it would be like,"" Kelly said.
But, he added, ""when you lose one in combat, there's a — in my opinion — there's a pride that goes with it, that he didn't have to be there doing what he was doing. He wanted to be there. He volunteered.""
Kelly said he gets ""occasional letters from Gold Star families who are asking, 'Was it worth it?' And I always go back with this: It doesn't matter. That's not our question to ask as parents. That young person thought it was worth it, and that's the only opinion that counts.""

Joe Ford, a member of Vanderbilt's F-Troop team that won the 1974 Southeastern Conference regular season title, has died. He was 64.
The McCracken County Sheriff's Department posted on its webpage that Ford was found dead Thursday morning at the scene of an accident on Interstate 24. Ford had been reported missing by family Tuesday, and a deputy investigating tracks off the side of the interstate found a 2010 GMC Arcadia on its side.
An autopsy is scheduled for Friday.
Vanderbilt officials learned of Ford's death from the sheriff's department. Vanderbilt athletic director David Williams says their thoughts are with the Ford family.
Ford played with Jeff Fosnes and Butch Feher with the F-Troop going 74-33 over four seasons, including the 1974 SEC title and an NCAA Tournament berth.

The casual observer could be forgiven for thinking that European antitrust regulators have declared war on American tech giants.
On June 27, the European Union imposed a €2.4 billion (US$2.75 billion) fine on Google for giving favorable treatment in its search engine results to its own comparison shopping service. And Germany’s antitrust enforcer is investigating Facebook for asking users to sign away control over personal information.
In contrast, American antitrust enforcers have shown little interest in these companies. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) did open an investigation into whether Google has a search bias, but closed it in 2013, despite recognizing that it “may have had the effect of harming individual competitors.”
Anti-Americanism, however, does not explain these starkly different approaches. Europe targets homegrown companies with the same ferocity. Last summer, for example, the EU fined a cartel of European truck-makers even more than it did Google.
Instead, the divergence is explained by America’s abandonment in the 1980s of the theory that competition promotes innovation, which is still embraced by Europe today. America now seems to operate under the theory that competition threatens innovation by denying companies that develop a superior product the rewards of monopoly.
My research suggests that embrace of this new theory has led to under-enforcement of America’s antitrust laws, which may in turn have actually held back innovation.

The mission of antitrust law, first articulated by the framers of the Sherman Act in 1890, is to ensure that markets contain large numbers of equally matched competitors. That’s why Europe calls its own antitrust rules “competition law.”
The Sherman Act implemented this goal by prohibiting two things: “restraint of trade,” such as price fixing, and monopolization, the attempt of a powerful company to keep competitors out of its markets. European competition laws have a similar bipartite structure.
The EU case against Google falls under the second category, monopolization, or as Europeans dub it “abuse of dominance.”
One of the most important and difficult areas of the law of monopolization involves infrastructure, which can be anything from the roads that crisscross America to the engineering standards that mobile phones use to communicate. Great innovations, such as Google’s search engine, often become the infrastructure that the next generation of competitors need to access in order to create their own, innovative products. But the infrastructure owner will often shut those competitors out, to maximize profits.
The goal of antitrust law would seem to require that its enforcers – the Department of Justice and the FTC in the U.S. – sue to force owners to share their infrastructure on reasonable terms with competitors.
But in the 1960s, skeptics – particularly antitrust economists and lawyers associated with the University of Chicago and led by Robert Bork – started to argue that forcing a business to share its infrastructure on an equal basis with competitors reduces the rewards a company can expect to generate from innovation, potentially discouraging technological progress.
If Google cannot earn monopoly profits on product search and sponsored links, will it stop investing in improving its search engine?
Getting the answer right is hugely important. Access to infrastructure may well have triggered the Industrial Revolution. A recent study shows that the abolition of serfdom in Russia in 1861 – which broke up the monopoly of feudal lords over a very important type of infrastructure, land – greatly increased the growth of the Russian economy. The authors concluded that Western Europe’s abolition of serfdom at least a century earlier probably explains its subsequent economic dominance.
Until the 1980s, American antitrust enforcers followed this example by breaking up “feudal estates” when they got too big. In 1912, for instance, the Justice Department won a case that forced the owners of the only two railroad bridges crossing the Mississippi river at St. Louis – which connected numerous eastern and western railroad systems – to allow access to competing companies.
The bridges were a superior product, relative to railroad ferries, and the sharing requirement no doubt reduced the owners’ profits. But the Justice Department was willing to bet that intervention would not chill incentives to innovate. America has done OK since.
The Justice Department made the same bet when it filed its last successful monopolization case in 1974, making AT&T give up the local telephone networks that once ran copper wires into most homes in America. That allowed an innovative competitor, MCI, to use those wires to connect home and office telephones to the company’s pioneering microwave and satellite transmission systems, halving long distance calling rates by 1990.

The view of the Chicago skeptics who opposed enforcement grew in power during the 1970s, reaching a tipping point in 1981 with the election of Ronald Reagan, who appointed its advocates to federal judgeships and leadership roles in the enforcement agencies. That view has proven resilient to changes in administration ever since.
The courts implemented the Chicago view by embracing a rule, known optimistically as the “rule of reason,” that enforcement of antitrust law is warranted only if there is no danger of chilling innovation. As the Supreme Court put it, intervention should take place only after “elaborate study.”
I argue in a recent paper that when enforcer budgets are limited, the rule of reason is just a polite way of partially repealing the antitrust laws, because the rule makes infrastructure cases, among others, too expensive for enforcers to litigate. And enforcement budgets are limited. Although budgets have increased in real terms since the 1970s, they have declined relative to the size of economy.
Antitrust enforcement has, in fact, suffered. Apart from the Microsoft case 20 years ago, in which the goal of breaking up the company wasn’t achieved, no other major monopolization cases have been filed since AT&T in 1974.
And even when cases are brought, usually by private individuals, the rule of reason has proven a virtually insurmountable obstacle to success.
Has all this at least led to an uptick in innovation? You might think that the answer is “yes,” given that Google and Facebook were both launched in the U.S. in recent years.
But both – as well as their incredible innovations – are the products not of monopoly but of competition. Google won the search wars by creating algorithms that beat those of rivals, including AltaVista and Yahoo. Facebook innovated by improving on the social network concept that erstwhile rival MySpace helped create. Both companies flourished thanks to equal access to the internet – in other words, net neutrality.
Measures of innovation for the economy as a whole, rather than individual success stories, provide a more reliable, and less encouraging, picture. The talk of the economics profession these days is the current combination of soaring corporate profits with the absence of an accompanying uptick in one measure of economy-wide expenditure on innovation – business investment.
This outcome is exactly what you’d expect in an economy of large companies that generate profits from their monopoly positions, rather than by offering better products.
The road not taken
Europe has not followed this path.
In the 1950s and ‘60’s, when the foundations for current European antitrust law were being laid, American enforcers still believed that competition promotes innovation. The American emphasis on protecting upstarts resonated with a continent still recovering from Nazism, which used state-sponsored monopolies to maintain control. The EU case against Google is firmly in that tradition, as is the investigation of Facebook, which dominates another new economy infrastructure, social media.
Although the European enforcement actions will only directly benefit Europeans, they are a reminder to Americans of the road not taken.

Scaramucci Issues Statement After His Wife Divorces Him Over His Obsession With Trump,"Scaramucci’s wife is divorcing him because she is tired of Scaramucci’s political ambitions and she hates President Trump. She reportedly is “not a fan of Trump, and she hasn’t exactly been on board and supportive of Anthony and his push to get back into the White House”, one source said (link below).
Scaramucci has just issued a statement in response to his wife divorcing him; “Leave civilians out of this. I can take the hits, but I would ask that you would put my family in your thoughts and prayers & nothing more.”
Don’t worry Scaramucci, no one will be bothering your family because there is plenty enough to go after you over. You’re just as disgusting as Trump, especially because you decided to put your wife and family’s best interests below your own ego and desire for attention by joining the Trump administration.
Scaramucci with his wife & the Trumps
Scaramucci has been trying to get into the Trump administration from day one, but has been previously blocked by White House Chief of Staff Reince Preibus. This explains why Scaramucci hates Preibus so much, and why Trump is only bringing Scaramucci on now, seven months into his term; he wants Preibus gone.
The couple had been married for three years and have three children together. It seems Trump’s home-wrecking abilities apparently know no bounds. The Daily Mail pointed out that Scaramucci was seen without his wedding ring at the White House earlier Thursday.
Numerous sources confirm the following, “Deidre has left him and has filed for divorce. She liked the nice Wall Street life and their home on Long Island, not the insane world of D.C. She is tired of his naked ambition, which is so enormous that it left her at her wits’ end. She has left him even though they have two children together.”
Scaramucci has been under fire since his ridiculously unacceptable interview with the New Yorker that was heavily laced with extreme profanity. The interview was without a doubt, the perfect catalyst for his wife to justifiably initiate her divorce from him. In the interview, he attacked Steve Bannon, saying, “I’m not Steve Bannon, I’m not trying to suck my own c*ck.” Steve Bannon may have some jokes for Scaramucci after today.

New poll shows Hillary Clinton is even less popular than Trump,"While the White House and Republican-controlled Senate grapple with their failure so far to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, a new poll by Bloomberg may give President Trump some good news -- he's more popular than his former Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton.
Bloomberg found that just 39 percent of Americans view Clinton favorably -- that's two points lower than Mr. Trump. And over a fifth of her own 2016 voters view her unfavorably. But Bloomberg also reported that those Clinton voters said that their negative views of the 2016 Democratic nominee were not related to her election loss. They appear largely to be more concerned that Democrats have not settled on the best way to approach 2018 -- and 2020.
The figure was Clinton's second-lowest score since Bloomberg began tracking the former presidential candidate in 2009.
Pollster J. Ann Selzer, who oversaw the survey, told Bloomberg that there's a ""growing discontent with Hillary Clinton as she has largely stayed out of the spotlight."" Clinton has popped up sporadically for select speaking engagements, often taking on Mr. Trump in speeches and through Twitter, but she has her party.
Selzer adds that the poor numbers, however, don't reflect negatively on the party as a whole -- other Democrats are polling well.
Similar to her performance in the 2016 campaign, Clinton was viewed favorably by just 35 percent of men, compared with 43 percent of women voters.
This comes as a national ABC/Washington Post poll released on Sunday showed that Mr. Trump's disapproval rating jumped to 58 percent, findings that Mr. Trump directly addressed on Twitter.
Tweeting that his near 40 percent favorable rating ""is not bad at this time"", the ABC/Washington Post poll was ""just about the most inaccurate poll around election time!""
The ABC/Washington Post Poll, even though almost 40% is not bad at this time, was just about the most inaccurate poll around election time!

‘We will never back down’: NRA-TV host calls out ‘violent left’ angered by Dana Loesch ad,"Dave Urbanski 1 hour
NRA-TV host Grant Stinchfield has a message for the ""violent left"" angered by Dana Loesch's ""clenched fist of truth"" ad: ""We will never back down."" (Image source: YouTube screenshot)
Outraged by left-wingers last week over an NRA ad featuring   TV’s Dana Loesch — who declared gun owners will fight their lies with “the clenched fist of truth” — NRA-TV host Grant Stinchfield got right in the face of the “violent left” and said in no uncertain terms, “We will never back down.”
Stinchfield called out the left, saying, “You people openly call for the assassination of our president and then claim the NRA is inciting violence? You set fire to buildings and attack people in the streets and then go ballistic for being called out.”
To those of you on the violent left who claim we believe there’s an “us” and “them” in this country? You’re absolutely right. There are those of us who believe in freedom; then there are those of you who actively burn down our country because you can’t get over the fact your so-called progressive didn’t win the election. Get over it and grow up.
He went on to reiterate Loesch’s argument that footage in her ad showed acts of violence committed by the left — and that if anything about the clip is scary, it’s the hard, cold fact that the very people who tout themselves as tolerant as if it’s in their DNA have been consistently guilty of blatant intolerance.
“So to every member of the lying media and the violent left demanding an apology, let me be very clear: It’ll never happen,” Stinchfield concluded. “We don’t apologize for warning America about chaos creators who want to impose their will upon us through their violence and lies. And we stand firm with the clenched fist of truth while they wilt with an open mouth of lies.”",TheBlaze,1
"In final stretch, Democratic primary for Miami Senate seat gets heated","Former state Rep. Ana Rivas Logan, left, and businesswoman Annette Taddeo are vying for the Democratic nomination in state Senate District 40.
Former state Rep. Ana Rivas Logan, left, and businesswoman Annette Taddeo are vying for the Democratic nomination in state Senate District 40.
July 18, 2017 5:27 PM
 
The Democratic primary in a special Miami state Senate race has gone from cordial to contentious, with Ana Rivas Logan getting help from an outside political group going after her better-funded opponent, Annette Taddeo.
Floridians for Accountability has pounded Taddeo in mailed campaign fliers, comparing her to President Donald Trump — perhaps the biggest bogeyman in a Democratic primary — over her family’s investments.
“What do Donald Trump and Annette Taddeo have in common?” one flier reads. “Annette Taddeo’s dirty money is a family affair,” reads another.
That, in turn, has prompted Taddeo to also compare Rivas Logan, a former Republican, to the Republican president.
“It’s Republicans who are funding the attacks [against me],” Taddeo said Sunday on WPLG-ABC 10’s “This Week in South Florida.” “That in itself speaks volumes.”
The two rivals have escalated their attacks over the past week, ahead of next Tuesday’s primary. Early voting by mail and in person is already under way. The winner of the Sept. 26 general election will replace Republican Sen. Frank Artiles, who resigned in April.
For much of the Senate District 40 campaign, it was the Republican primary among Rep. Jose Felix Diaz, former Sen. Alex Diaz de la Portilla and attorney Lorenzo Palomares that drew the most headlines. Rivas Logan, a former state representative, with $10,425 in the bank as of June 8, trails far behind Taddeo’s $45,559.
But last month, Floridians for Accountability, which had reported no political activity for two years, disclosed $147,000 in contributions — and started going after Taddeo, a translation business owner who has lost four previous elections.
Floridians for Accountability is run by Amy Rose, a Democratic consultant in Broward County, far from the Kendall-based 40th district in Miami-Dade County. The political committee’s biggest contribution, for $112,000, came from an unlikely source: Associated Industries of Florida, a business lobby whose own PAC has endorsed Diaz, a Republican, in the race.
AIF declined to comment through a spokeswoman, who said the organization doesn’t comment on political activity. Rose did not respond to questions Tuesday about AIF’s contribution.
Last week, Rose told the Miami Herald in a statement that Floridians for Accountability “is proud to support” Rivas Logan.
“Floridians can’t afford the type of leadership that Taddeo will bring to Tallahassee,” Rose said.
At issue is a trust for Taddeo’s 11-year-old daughter, Sofia. Taddeo, one flier says, “invests her money in the same companies that pollute our air, drive up healthcare costs, and cause cancer.”
Taddeo, who listed the trust and its investments in her candidate financial disclosure form, says the trust was set up by her mother for her daughter. It’s run by the bank, Taddeo said, adding that she has “zero control” over its investments.
“When they include my 11-year-old daughter in the ad, that is the lowest of the low,” she told WPLG.
At a Miami Herald editorial board interview earlier this month, Taddeo called on Rivas Logan to condemn the flier. Rivas Logan didn’t, though she told WPLG she had tried to call the PAC but “they don’t answer their phones.”
“For her to tie me to that is a little bit disingenuous,” Rivas Logan said. “They’re not attacking her daughter — they’re attacking her, and the way she’s investing her family’s money.”
Taddeo’s PAC, Fight for Florida, responded with its own flier showing Rivas Logan’s body wedged between Trump’s and Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s. As of June 30, Fight for Florida had reported only $300 cash on hand.
“Ana Rivas Logan: formerly Republican, always Republican,” the mailer reads.
“I am making sure that people know of her record, and that people know that she voted for Scott’s budget,” Taddeo told WPLG.
“When I was a member of the House I was extremely moderate,” said Rivas Logan, who noted that Taddeo had run for lieutenant governor in 2014 alongside Charlie Crist, a former Republican. “Ms. Taddeo was a candidate with somebody who changed parties as well, right before the election, not years before.”
“Charlie defends Democrats over and over and over again, and he is an elected Democratic member of Congress right now,” Taddeo shot back.
Her overarching pitch, Taddeo told WPLG: “Everybody knows me as a fighter who does not quit.”
“I have the experience — while I was in the state Legislature and on the School Board— to get things done,” Rivas Logan countered. “To go up there and just fight, fight, fight and not bring anything back, you’re not solving any problems.”

North Carolina residents and communities still reeling from the devastation of Hurricane Matthew could soon have access to hundreds of millions more federal dollars – even as state officials demand much more money and brace for the next storm.
This year’s hurricane season started June 1 and there have already been four named storms in the Atlantic. Nine months after Hurricane Matthew hammered eastern and central North Carolina, killing 28 people in the state, emergency personnel are fearing the next one, while still cleaning up the last one.
“My job is to ensure that we’re prepared for whatever threat or hazard is coming up next. It would be horrible if we had another huge hurricane come,” said Mike Sprayberry, the state’s director of emergency management. “We’ve got to be able to hurry up and work with our disaster survivors from Matthew, get them in a good place.”
The state has received more than $630 million in federal money since the monster storm last October, which caused massive flooding and $4.8 billion in damages. Another $500 million in federal dollars should be available by the end of the summer, according to state and federal officials – including nearly $200 million in block grants from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, just arriving from a pot of money Congress approved in December.
Members of the state’s congressional delegation are confident that the 2018 budget will bring even more relief.
Plus, state lawmakers approved $100 million in disaster relief during this year’s legislative session, on top of $200 million provided in December. Gov. Roy Cooper on Tuesday signed a measure directing how to spend the latest state money.
“For families recovering from a natural disaster, help can never come too quickly and we’re working hard to make sure communities get the help they need,” Cooper said in a statement. “The $1.3 billion in state and federal relief funds dedicated so far are a start but much more work remains. I will continue to work with the legislature, congressional leaders, and federal officials to bring the resources necessary to help families and communities rebuild.”
Cooper requested $929 million in aid from the federal government’s latest funding bill in April. Congress approved $8.2 billion for emergency and disaster relief as part of the $1 trillion spending deal, but HUD awarded North Carolina only $6.1 million – less than 1 percent of Cooper’s request – setting off a minor partisan squabble in what has been a largely bipartisan effort to deliver dollars for North Carolina.
Cooper, a Democrat, called it “an incredible failure by the Trump administration and congressional leaders to turn their backs.”
“Shame on the governor,” said Republican Rep. Robert Pittenger, whose district includes Robeson County and the majority of Cumberland and Bladen counties. “(Cooper) threw us under the bus like we weren’t doing our job.”
A state must show unmet need in order to obtain funds from HUD under requirements implemented in 2011, and North Carolina only recently had its state action plan approved by the federal agency. HUD is reconsidering North Carolina’s request and could add more funding from the April law. Meantime, the approval of the action plan clears the way for HUD to provide the new block grants, 80 percent of which are earmarked for hard-hit Robeson, Cumberland, Edgecombe and Wayne counties.
The rest of the new funding expected this summer comes from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and includes $200 million more in public assistance for repairing roads and bridges, and $100 million for moving homes out of the way of future flooding – money that has already been designated for specific homes.
Andrew Richardson of Fayetteville looks for salvageable furniture in a pile of debris outside a gutted home Tuesday, Nov. 15, 2016 in Lumberton, one of the most heavily flooded areas in N.C. following Hurricane Matthew.
[Hurricane Matthew was so devastating that there will never be another storm with the same name]
Sprayberry said the state could use many millions more dollars in block grants to do hazard mitigation, which is aimed at reducing future loss of life and property in a disaster.
In the wake of Hurricane Matthew, that would mean getting thousands of homes out of the way of future flooding by using a combination of federal and state money to buy out property owners, tear down their former homes and return the land to green space; elevate the homes above anticipated flood levels; or, where no other option is available, tear down badly damaged homes and rebuild them higher.
The state has years of experience in hazard mitigation. After Hurricane Floyd in 1999, North Carolina became a national leader in using the program to get people out of harm’s way.
After Matthew, 3,987 homeowners across Eastern North Carolina applied for hazard mitigation grants. About 2,700 of them were found eligible to participate, but even with the $100 million in mitigation funds the state expects to receive, only 788 can be funded.
“We can only take care of the worst cases we have,” Sprayberry said. “That leaves a lot of folks out. So there is still a great unmet need.”
Most of the 788 homes chosen for mitigation so far are in the four counties hardest hit by flooding from the storm: Robeson, Wayne, Edgecombe and Cumberland.
Joseph Young, who lives in Clinton, in Sampson County, applied for a buyout on a second home he has in the county. A relative rents the two-bedroom house, which has less than 700 square feet and sits on a half acre of land that is prone to flood in any good rain. After Hurricane Matthew, Young said, water rose all the way to the floor joists, ruining all the ductwork and some of the insulation, and inundating the air conditioning system.
Young, 76, said he would happily sell for the $49,000 appraised value in order to be rid of the worry. Alternatively, he’d like to get the house elevated. But while the home was eligible for the mitigation program, it wasn’t funded.
“They sent me a letter that said, ‘Not at this time,’ ” Young said.
In some counties, Sprayberry said, no mitigation projects will be funded with the money available so far.
“You’d think we could have at least had one,” said Bladen County Emergency Management Director Bradley Kinlaw. “We had 60 applications. We got zero. We’ve got folks who really need some assistance, and we need to get them squared away.”
In his county, residents living along the South and Black rivers suffered the most, and many had rebuilt after being flooded from Hurricane Floyd. No one thought it could happen twice in 20 years, and certainly, Kinlaw said, no one wants to take a chance on living through that again.
The nearly nine months that have passed since the storm have been hard on those families, Kinlaw said. Many have been paying mortgages on their flooded homes, which they can’t occupy, so they’re also paying rent to stay somewhere else or are staying with friends or family.
“And they have to try to find money to fix up their homes on top of that?” Kinlaw said. “These people are struggling. We’ve got to get them some help.”
Said Pittenger: “You have all these homes that have been abandoned. These are blocks and neighborhoods of homes that have just been left.”
The additional money on its way is certainly welcome, even if everyone – survivors, officials on the ground and lawmakers in D.C. – wish it came quicker.
“The funding is not late,” Sprayberry said. “That’s the process.”
Food waters cover signs and buildings on U.S. Hwy. 70 in Kinston, NC on Oct. 14, 2016.
Under the Budget Control Act of 2011, a measure passed to solve an impasse over the debt ceiling, federal agencies must verify a state’s need for disaster relief before providing funding. Previously, Congress could simply appropriate the money. The process involves data collection on the ground in affected areas, putting together reports at the state level and getting it to proper agencies in the federal government, which must analyze the data and deliver the money to the state.
“It’s a slow process. Everybody’s to blame. The bureaucracy is to blame. It just takes too frickin’ long. It’s called CYA. You don’t get a meritorious award by being expeditious. You want to make sure that you don’t get caught and something went wrong and it’s your fault,” Pittenger said. “Everybody’s been overly protective and cautious to make sure that somebody in the bureaucracy doesn’t get a whippin’ with a wet noodle.”
After HUD’s $6.1 million award, some North Carolina lawmakers questioned the formula used by the department and whether HUD had proper data on the Matthew disaster. They requested further review. The agency is now “reviewing additional data” and expects to publish “any changes in the grant amount” soon, a HUD spokesman said in response to a request for more clarity on the status of Matthew relief.
“It’s a disappointment. I’m not trying to gloss over it,” U.S. Rep. David Price, a Chapel Hill Democrat, said of the $6.1 million allotment.
In the latest dispersal in May, HUD allocated money to Louisiana, West Virginia, Texas, South Carolina and North Carolina for disasters that occurred in 2015 and 2016. The department has more money that it can allocate if North Carolina or other states that show continued unmet needs.
“The Appropriations Committee included extra dollars for North Carolina and other states. It’s sitting there and available, if in fact the state, working with HUD, can verify that the money is needed,” said Rep. David Rouzer, a Johnston County Republican whose 7th District covers Wilmington and much of the southeastern part of the state.
Much of the federal and state money is earmarked for specific uses. For example, the state’s $100 million fund includes $25 million for housing, $30 million for non-residential infrastructure grants, $20 million for agriculture, $2.7 million for community colleges and $22.3 million in federal matching dollars. Those buckets of money are further targeted.
The HUD block grants, however, provide much more flexibility, Rouzer said.
“I’m hoping a good portion can go to Fair Bluff and other small towns in my district and Rep. Pittenger’s district that were so devastated,” Rouzer said. “There are small towns that need a lot of work in terms of water system repair, sewer system repair, community buildings and streets that were wiped out.”
Residents return from checking their homes after Hurricane Matthew caused downed trees, power outages, a municipal water outage and widespread flooding along the Lumber River Thursday, October 13, 2016 in Lumberton, NC.
Even with more than $1 billion in federal dollars coming to the state, lawmakers aren’t done trying to secure additional help for victims.
Price, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, introduced an amendment calling for $5 billion for disaster relief for states with unmet needs in the 2018 budget bill. Price’s amendment, part of a larger $200 billion infrastructure amendment, failed on a party-line vote in committee.
New Jersey Republican Rodney Frelinghuysen, the committee’s chairman, said he would work to ensure additional financial assistance for North Carolina is in the 2018 budget.
Said Frelinghuysen: “We must stand with these hurting people.”

What federal aid has North Carolina gotten?
$104.7 million in public assistance (debris removal, emergency services, repairs of roads and bridges)
$97.5 million in individual assistance (help for uninsured or underinsured homeowners and renters up to $33,000, as well as transition assistance such as hotels)
$195.4 million from the National Flood Insurance Program (paid claims)
$100.8 million in Small Business Administration loans (approved amount)
$134 million through U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Transportation and Army Corps of Engineers
What else is North Carolina expected to get this summer?
$200 million in public assistance
$100 million to $114 million in hazard mitigation grants (buyouts, elevations or demolition/reconstruction for damaged homes)
$204 million from Housing and Urban Development in the form of block grants (80 percent of which must be used in Robeson, Cumberland, Edgecombe and Wayne counties), including $198 million from December’s spending bill and $6 million from April’s spending bill

TOKYO Two U.S bombers flew over the disputed South China Sea, the U.S. Air Force said on Friday, asserting the right to treat the region as international territory despite China's claims in the busy waterway.
The flight from Guam on Thursday came as U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping prepare for a likely meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany. The two leaders were expected to discuss what Beijing can do to rein in Pyongyang's missiles and nuclear weapons programs.
The United States believes North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile on Tuesday that put parts of the U.S. mainland within range of Pyongyang's warheads for the first time.
China claims nearly all of the South China Sea, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes each year, a stance contested by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. Beijing usually protests against freedom of navigation operations such as bomber flights.
The United States has criticized China's build-up of military facilities in the South China Sea, concerned that they could be used to extend Beijing's strategic reach.
The two Lancers that made the latest flight had earlier trained with Japanese jet fighters in the neighboring East China Sea, the first time the two forces had conducted joint night-time drills.
""This is a clear demonstration of our ability to conduct seamless operations with all our allies,"" U.S. Air Force spokesman Major Ryan Simpson said in a statement.
Two U.S. B-1B Lancer bombers flew from Guam over the South China Sea last month, while a U.S. warship carried out a maneuvering drill within 12 nautical miles of one of China's artificial islands in the waterway in late May.

"I’ll urge Pacquiao to quit, says trainer Roach","Brisbane (Australia) – Manny Pacquiao’s trainer advised the Filipino legend to quit boxing Monday after his sensational defeat to unheralded Australian Jeff Horn.
While controversy raged over the scoring of Sunday’s World Boxing Organization welterweight title bout in Brisbane, after all three judges awarded it to unbeaten Horn, there were doubts whether 38-year-old Pacquiao would return for a possible rematch.
Hall of Fame trainer Freddie Roach said he would consider advising Pacquiao to retire after a glittering 22-year professional career in which he won world titles at an unprecedented eight weight divisions.
“I’m going to talk to Manny about maybe calling it a day, maybe this is it,” Roach said.
Given no chance by most observers, the 29-year-old Horn’s ultra-aggressive style rocked Pacquiao, with the three judges scoring the fight 117-111, 115-113 and 115-113 to the Australian before 51,000 fans at Suncorp Stadium.

DAMNING list SKEWERS liberals’ hysterical hypocrisy over Trump,"Hey folks, these points are circulating around the internet and summarize a lot in a simple list. Just a little something you can surmise, after church, to remind you why we refer to progressive socialists as hypocrites…especially the media accomplices aiding and abetting the liberal progressive propaganda machine, and deceptive lies.
Remember when CNN referred to itself as “the most trusted name in news?” Yep, “This is CNN” with that booming voice of James Earl Jones. Or how about the Huntley-Brinkley News report on NBC all those years ago? Now those guys were for real. Oh well, now the alphabet soup of news media consisting of ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, CNN, PBS, and most of the print news media are supposed to make us believe these past six months have been so egregious and damning for America?

President Obama Holds Closed-Door Fundraiser for National Democratic Redistricting Committee,"It didn’t take long for Hillary Clinton to come out of hiding in the woods. She’s participated in a number of speaking engagements since then, blaming everyone for her loss except herself, and bashing President Donald Trump.
Even most liberals are sick of seeing the woman, who represents nothing but failure to them. Despite that, the Democrat establishment has apparently learned nothing from Hillary’s loss. Last week, the DNCC released a possible new campaign slogan for the next congressional elections: “Democrats 2018: I mean, have you seen the other guys?” Such a slogan is particularly hilarious because voters have seen the “other guys” – and that’s why Republicans took 1,042 seats at the federal and state level out of Democrats’ hands during the Obama Administration.
Further compounding the problem, the Democrats are now turning to the man who presided over (and helped cause) the loss of those 1,042 lost seats. The DNC has only raised $32.6 million so far this year, and has $7.7 million in cash on hand, with $1.9 million in debt. Meanwhile, the RNC has raised $61.9 million, has $41.8 million in cash on hand, and no debt. So, to try to change those figures, they’re turning to Barack Obama.
Former president Barack Obama will formally reenter the political fray this week less than six months after leaving office, headlining a fundraiser for a group that could prove critical to the Democratic Party’s rebuilding efforts.
Obama’s appearance Thursday before a few dozen people at a closed-door event in the District on behalf of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee (NDRC) highlights the balance he is trying to strike as his party seeks to regain its footing at both the state and national levels. Obama does not want to cast “a long shadow,” in the words of Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, but he remains a central figure for a party that has yet to settle on a single strategy to combat President Trump.
Perez said in an interview Sunday that while some Democrats have urged Obama recently, “You’ve got to get out front on issue X or issue Y,” the former president wants instead to “build the bench” for the party. Democrats suffered a greater loss of power during Obama’s tenure than under any other two-term president since World War II.
So given that last line, why is Obama the man they’re rallying behind? Who knows, but I strongly encourage it.
“Because tomorrow’s president is today’s state senator. And he knows that very personally,” said Perez, referring to Obama’s experience as a state senator in Illinois. “When you lose 900 state legislative seats, those are people who could have been the next governors and senators and Cabinet positions, and that is something that he’s very committed to.”
The NDRC’s executive director, Kelly Ward, would not say how much the fundraiser is expected to bring in. But she said Obama “still has such a microphone” to help convince donors to invest in state-level races and help in “shining a light” on a phenomenon that influences the outcome of elections year after year.
Remember: Obama promised to keep to the sidelines once Trump took over. This new engagement violates that promise, proving once again that Obama can’t keep his word.
— Luxury Yacht Owner (@CounterMoonbat) July 10, 2017
Even as the Democrats have tried to rally the troops behind the cause of the “Resistance,” they haven’t been able to win a single special election during the Trump presidency.
Think they’re tired of losing yet? Let’s hope Obama continues their losing streak.

Do Most Christians Even Read The The Bible? Atheists Have!,"When many people are asked why they became an atheist, they respond with something along the lines of “I started reading the Bible.” Here are a few of the many verses that may lead someone to say that:
1. 1 Peter 2:18
“Servants, be submissive to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the harsh.”
Yes, servants are supposed to just submit to their masters even if they get beaten in the process.
“He who is emasculated by crushing or mutilation shall not enter the assembly of the LORD.”
So, if you lose your dick, you can’t get into heaven? What about people who had testicular cancer? Sorry, guys. But, circumcision is okay, though. Hypocritical much?
“For everyone who curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death. He has cursed his father or his mother. His blood shall be upon him.”
How is this justified?! If you get into an argument with your parents, you get put to death?! That’s ridiculous.
“God commanded: If a father has a stubborn, rebellious son, murder the son.”
What happened to “Thou shalt not kill.” The Bible is full of contradictions.
“For any man who has a defect shall not approach: a man blind or lame, who has a marred face or any limb too long, a man who has a broken foot or broken hand, or is a hunchback or a dwarf, or a man who has a defect in his eye, or eczema or scab, or is a eunuch.”
So, I guess you must be a perfect male specimen to get into Heaven.

"If Trump Is Serious About Curbing Iran, He’ll Kill Boeing’s Plan to Sell It Planes","You may have missed it, but there was big news on the Iran front earlier this month. After much hesitation, Total, the French energy giant, plunged back into the Iranian market, committing to become the primary operator in a $5-billion deal to develop the country’s South Pars offshore gas field. In doing so, Total became the first major Western energy firm to invest in Iran since the 2015 nuclear agreement, or the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). As such, Total’s move could have far-reaching implications, paving the way for a flood of new investments not only by other big oil and gas companies, but also by a host of multinationals eager to tap Iran’s post-sanctions business prospects.
That can’t be welcome news for a Trump administration committed to constraining Iranian aggression. The likely strategic effects of a much-strengthened Iranian economy aren’t hard to fathom. The regime’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) dominates the commanding heights of Iran’s economy — including the energy sector. A richer Iran inevitably means more money flowing into the coffers of precisely the forces that have served as the vanguard of the Islamic Republic’s most threatening activities — not just in the nuclear sphere, but terrorism, ballistic missiles, and the regime’s relentless bid for regional hegemony as well.
Further, it goes without saying that the more Iran’s economy is bolstered by large-scale Western business deals, the harder it will be for the United States to deploy sanctions effectively to compel changes in the mullahs’ bad behavior. Politically speaking, powerful Asian, European, and U.S. corporations will fight tooth and nail against measures that could threaten their newly won positions in the Iranian market.
As for the economics, it’s a pretty good rule of thumb (North Korea notwithstanding) that the ability of sanctions to achieve their strategic goals is inversely related to the size, strength, and diversity of the target country’s economy. Simply put, the more resilient Iran’s economy grows, the greater its ability to withstand Western economic pressure. That would leave the United States with few options other than the threat of war to prevent the emergence of a future Iranian menace — from the resurgence of its nuclear weapons program to the testing of an intercontinental ballistic missile.
Regrettably, the Trump administration may have inadvertently encouraged Total’s decision to conclude its deal. For months after the U.S. presidential elections, Total delayed moving forward with Iran out of concern over President Donald Trump’s opposition to the JCPOA. Last February, the company’s chairman said that if the U.S. withdrew from the nuclear deal, “we will not be able to invest.”
But several developments this spring apparently gave Total reason to suspect that Trump’s bark might be worse than his bite. One was the administration’s decision in April to certify to Congress that Iran remained in compliance with all its obligations under the JCPOA — despite repeated violations of some of the deal’s key constraints regarding things like stocks of heavy water (begrudgingly, the Trump team issued its second report certifying Iran’s JCPOA compliance Tuesday night). That was followed by the decision in late May, in response to another congressional deadline, to continue the Obama administration’s policy of granting certain sanctions relief to Iran, as called for in the JCPOA.
To its credit, the Trump team did attempt to limit the impression that it was going soft on the mullahs. The certification of Iranian compliance was coupled with the announcement that a comprehensive review of Iran policy was underway, including the JCPOA. The waiver of nuclear sanctions was accompanied by new designations against a handful of entities and individuals involved in Iran’s missile program. Nevertheless, the mixed signals and overall lack of policy clarity seem to have provided Total with sufficient comfort to alter its risk calculus.
If the administration still hopes to prevent a broader rush of Western business into Iran, it needs to start sending the markets a far stronger, more definitive message of opposition — and the quicker the better. In that regard, Trump’s silence in the face of Total’s decision was unfortunate. At a minimum, some arm of the U.S. government — the White House, State Department, Treasury, take your pick — should have gone on record expressing concern about leading Western companies enriching a hostile regime that remains up to its eyeballs in illicit activities, not to mention the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. Foreign companies should have no doubts that not only are they exposing themselves to substantial reputational risks in Iran, but legal and financial jeopardy as well from a U.S. government that intends to keep close tabs on their transactions — especially the identities of their local business partners and any possible links to the IRGC or other U.S.-designated entities.
As a sign of the Trump administration’s seriousness, however, there’s probably no stronger deterrent message that it could send about the continued dangers of doing business with Iran than putting the brakes on the planned sale of civilian aircraft to Iran by one of America’s leading companies, Boeing, as well as its European competitor, Airbus. For reasons still hard to fathom — beyond the obvious need to appease Iran — the Obama administration agreed under the JCPOA to allow Iranian carriers to purchase Western passenger jets. As part of the nuclear deal, the Obama White House also agreed to remove sanctions on Iran Air, the Islamic Republic’s flagship airline.
In short order, Airbus and Boeing both inked multibillion-dollar deals with Iran Air. Obama’s Treasury Department lost little time issuing the necessary export licenses (though a European company, Airbus requires the U.S. license because its aircraft contain significant U.S. content). Airbus delivered its first planes earlier this year, while Boeing’s initial deliveries are scheduled for 2018.
While harshly critical of the JCPOA in general, Trump and his team have been noticeably silent when it comes to the Boeing deal. Given the president’s competing priority of reinvigorating the U.S. manufacturing sector, many suspect that he’s reluctant to forego the thousands of jobs that Boeing claims the sales could support. Boeing reinforced that suspicion when it announced in April that it had signed a second deal to sell planes to another Iranian carrier, Aseman Airlines, with a potential value of $6 billion. One might have anticipated that an administration highly skeptical of the JCPOA would have something to say about the first major Iran deal signed by a U.S. company under the Trump presidency. But again, nothing but crickets. That lack of reaction almost certainly was another factor contributing to Total’s decision to finalize its own deal with Iran.
If the president and his administration are as committed to combatting terrorism and Iranian aggression as they’ve suggested, blocking the Boeing and Airbus deals really shouldn’t be too hard of a call. It’s well established that Iran’s civilian airline industry has long been used in support of the regime’s illicit activities, particularly on behalf of the IRGC. When the U.S. designated Iran Air in 2011, the Department of Treasury stated that “rockets or missiles have been transported via Iran Air passenger aircraft, and IRGC officers occasionally take control over Iran Air flights carrying special IRGC-related cargo. The IRGC is also known to disguise and manifest such shipments as medicine and generic spare parts, and IRGC officers have discouraged Iran Air pilots from inspecting potentially dangerous IRGC-related cargo being carried aboard a commercial Iran Air aircraft, including to Syria.” Multiple other Iranian airlines have also been designated for illicit activities. As for Boeing’s second Iranian partner, Aseman Airlines, while it may not have been designated, its CEO was a longtime senior IRGC commander.
The Obama administration never gave any justification for agreeing to remove Iran Air’s designation. No evidence was ever presented to suggest that the company’s illicit activities on behalf of the IRGC had ceased. On the contrary, there’s every reason to believe that the opposite is true. As our colleague at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Emanuele Ottolenghi, has meticulously documented, in the year after the JCPOA went into effect, Iran Air flew nearly 100 flights to war-torn Syria — not filled with tourists, but almost certainly continuing to ferry weapons and militants to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s campaign of mass murder of his own people. One of the authors has been briefed privately that U.S. and other Western intelligence services concur with that judgement and have the evidence to back it up.
The fact is that, if he chooses, Trump has ample grounds to suspend the export licenses already granted to Boeing and Airbus, pending a thorough review by the U.S. intelligence community that concludes with high confidence that Iran Air and the broader commercial airline sector in Iran are no longer supporting the Islamic Republic’s deadly activities. If he did so, the president would almost certainly have strong support in Congress, where at least five pieces of legislation have been introduced calling for such an assessment. Illustrative of the broader sentiment was a letter sent to Trump in April by Florida Senator Marco Rubio and Illinois Representative Peter Hoskam, which noted that “Iran, the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism, has systematically used commercial aircraft for illicit military purposes, including to transport troops, weapons, and cash to rogue regimes and terrorist groups around the world. The possibility that U.S.-manufactured aircraft could be used as tools of terror is absolutely unacceptable and should not be condoned by the U.S. government.”
A presidential decision to delay the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran should also have the full backing of America’s Arab allies in the Gulf, especially Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Neither country has yet expressed concern about the Boeing deals. But if they did, their word would likely carry significant weight — both with the president and with Boeing. During his trip to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in late May, the president hailed his success in securing Saudi agreement to a multi-year package of arms sales and commercial deals estimated to be worth close to $400 billion, dwarfing the value of Boeing’s proposed transactions with Iran. While multiple U.S. companies will profit from the deals, Boeing promises to be among the leading beneficiaries. The Saudis have already committed to buying Boeing Chinook helicopters and P-8 surveillance planes, and will form several joint ventures with the company to service the kingdom’s defense sector. And a domestic Saudi airline is negotiating with Boeing for the purchase of 16 wide-body passenger jets.
If put to a choice, it’s hard to believe that Boeing would risk its longstanding and lucrative relations with the Gulf Arab countries in order to maintain the company’s controversial deals with a terror-supporting Iran. Boeing’s success very much depends on both prongs of its business — commercial aviation and defense. For years, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates have been major patrons in both sectors. On the civil side, their large national carriers have been regular Boeing customers. And on the defense side — where operating margins are significantly higher than in the commercial aircraft business — the Saudis in particular, but also the Emiratis, are among the top arms purchasers in the world. Even if Boeing’s planned commercial sales to Iran were allowed to stand, the chances are less than zero that the Islamic Republic will ever be allowed to buy any of the company’s weapons system or services. Should they choose to exercise it, in short, Saudi and Emirati leverage to influence Boeing’s decision-making when it comes to Iran could be substantial.
Trump has called the JCPOA the “worst deal” ever negotiated and has said that “all nations of conscience must work together to isolate Iran, deny it funding for terrorism, and pray for the day when the Iranian people have the just and righteous government they deserve.” Saudi Arabia and its neighbors claim that Iran poses an existential threat to their very survival. None of those views can be easily reconciled with a policy that stands aside and permits Boeing, one of America’s most iconic companies, to embrace the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism as a legitimate business partner. In no small measure, whether the Total decision winds up being an unfortunate exception to Iran’s relative isolation or the watershed moment that marks its collapse — with all the geostrategic consequences that entails — now hinges on whether Boeing’s deal with Iran is allowed to proceed unimpeded. If combatting Iranian aggression is as important an objective as the Trump administration and its Arab allies claim, the time has come to back their words with action. Stopping the Boeing deal will be a litmus test of their seriousness.",Foreign Policy,0
Merkel softens her opposition to gay marriage,"Berlin – German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday softened for the first time her opposition to gay marriage, as her conservative party comes under growing pressure on the issue ahead of elections in September.
Merkel, who had repeatedly voiced her opposition to gay marriage, said that lawmakers could vote according to their conscience, and not toe the party line.
Germany introduced civil unions for gay and lesbian couples in 2001, but they do not have the right to marry.
“I would like to orient the discussion in a direction which raises the question of a decision according to conscience rather than imposing anything,” she told Brigitte, a women’s magazine.
This is a significant shift for Merkel, who in 2013 said she opposed same-sex unions for “the well-being of children.”

South Africa's Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng (Top, C) looks on with other judges before making a ruling at the Constitutional Court in Johannesburg, South Africa ,June 22,2017.
Bantu Holomisa (C), head of the United Democratic Movement (UDM), speaks to members of the media after Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng made a ruling at the Constitutional Court in Johannesburg, South Africa, June 22,2017.
JOHANNESBURG/CAPE TOWN South Africa's top court ruled on Thursday that secret ballots may be held for motions of no confidence in parliament, a potential blow to the tenure of beleaguered President Jacob Zuma who said such a vote would be unfair.
The court's ruling by no means guarantees a secret ballot will be held, however. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng said in effect that whether a secret ballot actually takes places is up to the Speaker of parliament.
But it ended any question about whether a secret ballot on Zuma could take place.
Zuma's critics want the no-confidence vote to be anonymous hoping it will embolden lawmakers from his African National Congress (ANC) party to support his ouster by shielding them from pressure.
His administration has been beset by scandals and criticized for failing to address serious economic problems.
""I think it is not fair because you are trying to increase the majority you don't have,"" Zuma told parliament after the court decision.
Zuma has survived four no-confidence votes during his eight years in power thanks to loyal voting by ANC lawmakers, who form a strong parliamentary majority.
But opposition parties believe a recent cabinet reshuffle that led to the dismissal of respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan and a slew of credit rating downgrades have angered ANC MPs sufficiently to desert Zuma.
Speaker Baleka Mbete, a top ANC official who now must decide the issue, had said secret ballots were not allowed under parliamentary rules.
She was non-commital after the ruling, simply noting that she now had the right to decide.
In handing down a unanimous ruling by the full bench, Mogoeng, the chief justice, said a vote in parliament should not be ""a fear or money-inspired sham"" and the Speaker should consider the interests of the country, rather than party, when deciding the nature of the vote.
""Crass dishonesty in the form of bribe-taking or other illegitimate methods of gaining undeserved majorities must not be discounted from the Speaker's decision process,"" he said. ""When that happens in a motion of no-confidence, the outcome could betray the people's interests.""
In a statement, the Speaker noted the court's ruling that it was up to her.
After the ruling, the rand pared its gains to 0.3 percent against the dollar from 1 percent earlier. The currency had firmed on hopes Mogoeng would order, rather than simply permit, a secret vote.
The ANC -- once all-powerful as heir of South Africa's anti-apartheid struggle -- has lost popularity under Zuma, underscored by its worst electoral showing in over two decades of power in local elections last year.
South Africa has sunk into recession and had its credit rating downgraded to junk by two of the top three credit rating agencies. Unemployment is at a 14-year high of 27.7 percent.
""I'm fit and I'm doing it (the job of president) very well,"" Zuma said in response to a call by a lawmaker that he stand down as president.
Zuma said the economy would come out of recession ""quicker than we believe"".
One ANC lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that in a secret ballot they would vote for Zuma's removal. ""I would vote for him to go. He is ruining the country,"" the legislator told Reuters.
A member of the South African Communist Party, one of the ANC's allies in power, told Reuters he ""would be guided by what the Communist Party has said about the president"". The SACP, which has 17 lawmakers, said in April Zuma should resign.
The main opposition Democratic Alliance party said Mbete, the Speaker, now would have little choice but to call for a secret ballot.
""I think it's a great day for democracy for South Africa. I think the Speaker will be very hard pressed indeed to deny a secret ballot in this particular case,"" said the party's Federal Executive Chairperson James Selfe.
The ANC rallied behind Zuma, however, saying it will vote against the motion to remove the 75-year old leader. A successful vote of no-confidence would trigger the collapse of Zuma's government.
""We have unqualified and unequivocal confidence in the ANC caucus not to vote in support of a motion to remove the president,"" ANC's parliamentary chief whip Jackson Mthembu said.
Zuma has suffered a string of judicial setbacks, but has held on to power with the backing of his party.

38 Million Pieces of Plastic Waste Were Found on an Uninhabited South Pacific Island,"Henderson Island is covered by nearly 20 tons of plastic—the highest density of anthropogenic debris recorded anywhere on Earth.
July 11, 2017, 12:00 PM GMT
One of the world’s most remote places, an uninhabited coral atoll, is also one of its most polluted.
Henderson Island, a tiny landmass in the eastern South Pacific, has been found by marine scientists to have the highest density of anthropogenic debris recorded anywhere in the world, with 99.8% of the pollution plastic.
The nearly 18 tonnes of plastic piling up on an island that is otherwise mostly untouched by humans have been pointed to as evidence of the catastrophic, “grotesque” extent of marine plastic pollution.
Nearly 38m pieces of plastic were estimated to be on Henderson by researchers from the University of Tasmania and the UK’s Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, weighing a combined 17.6 tonnes (19.4 U.S. tons).
The majority of the debris – approximately 68% – was not even visible, with as many as 4,500 items per square metre buried to a depth of 10cm. About 13,000 new items were washing up daily.
Jennifer Lavers, of the University of Tasmania’s institute for marine and antarctic studies, told the Guardian the sheer volume of plastic pollution on Henderson had defied her expectations.
“I’ve travelled to some of the most far-flung islands in the world and regardless of where I’ve gone, in what year, and in what area of the ocean, the story is generally the same: the beaches are littered with evidence of human activity ...
“However, my thought was the remarkable remoteness of Henderson Island would have afforded it some protection. I was totally wrong.
“The quantity left me speechless and that’s why I went to such pains to document it in such detail.”
Lavers found hundreds of crabs living in rubbish such as bottle caps and cosmetics jars, and has been told of one living inside a doll’s head.
“From the looks on people’s faces, it was quite grotesque,” she said. “That was how I felt about all these crabs – we are not providing them a home, this is not a benefit to them.
“This plastic is old, it’s brittle, it’s sharp, it’s toxic. It was really quite tragic seeing these gorgeous crabs scuttling about, living in our waste.”
The largest of the four islands of the Pitcairn Island group, Henderson Island is a Unesco World Heritage Listed site and one of the few atolls in the world whose ecology has been practically untouched by humans.
The island exhibits remarkable biological diversity given it covers only 3,700 hectares, with 10 endemic species of plant and four land bird species. Its isolation had, until recently, afforded it protection from most human activities.
Lavers said her findings had proved to her nowhere was safe from plastic pollution. “All corners of the globe are already being impacted.”
Like seabirds and turtles, remote islands serve as sentinels for the health of the wider marine ecosystem, “acting like a sieve or a trap, filtering out the ocean”, she said.
The state of Henderson – “the most polluted, most remote island in the whole world” – was indicative of the extent of the problem, and the “absolutely mind-boggling” rate at which plastic was being produced globally.
The 17.6 tonnes of plastic on Henderson accounted for only 1.98 seconds’ worth of annual production, found the paper – co-written by Lavers with Alexander Bond – published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday.
“Across the board, no country got a free pass on this – we found bottles from Germany, containers from Canada, I think it was a fishing crate from New Zealand. What that says is we all have a responsibility in this, and we have to sit up and pay attention to that.”
The threat to biodiversity posed by plastic debris has come under increased scrutiny as findings reveal the extent of the problem, with millions of tonnes ending up in the ocean every year.
In February, scientists reported “extraordinary” levels of toxic pollution in the Mariana trench, with plastic waste facilitating the spread of industrial chemicals to one of the most remote and inaccessible places on the planet.
At the world oceans summit in early March, Indonesia pledged to put up to $1bn a year towards reducing plastic and other waste products polluting its waters, setting a goal of a 70% reduction in marine waste within eight years.
Laver said individuals and governments had a part to play in reducing the amount of plastic polluting the world’s oceans, but the key was urgency.
“For me, marine plastic pollution is the new climate change, but I would like for us to not make the same mistakes. We’ve been arguing about climate change, and whether it exists and what is changing, for the better part of 40 years ...
“Let’s not wait for more science. Let’s not debate it. The rate of plastic in our oceans is absolutely phenomenal, and we need to do something now.”

Next Islamic State: Australia’s Indonesia Challenge,"Australia needs a new strategic approach to countering terrorism in Indonesia.
If we compile a list of the nationalities of people who have killed the most Australians in terrorist attacks, the country at the top of the list (or near the top) is Indonesia. This is not only the Australian past, it is likely to be the Australian future as well. With Islamic extremism on the rise in Indonesia, and terrorist incidents in 2016 doubling over the previous year in Indonesia, a spike in Australian deaths from Indonesian terrorists is inevitable.
The latest terrorist attack in Indonesia, which killed three policemen on May 27, has been attributed by police to Islamic State. Writing in   on June 16, I argued that there will be a follow-on revolutionary Islamic state to take on the mantle of the caliphate after the ISIS organization and forces in Raqqa are “defeated.” U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson suggested as much in his confirmation hearings in January 2017.
The difficult challenge for the Australian government wanting to protect its citizens is that most if not all of the future terrorist attacks by Indonesians on Australia will be on the territory of the northern neighbor, not at home down under. How does a country like Australia, with 25 million people and tiny defense and security forces, deal with this threat coming both from and inside a country of 230 million, the largest Muslim majority country in the world? How does Australia deal with it in an environment where bilateral political relations are suffering occasional emotional rifts and where many Australians have an unjustified fear of peaceful Islamic radicalism?

At an official level, the two countries signed a joint memorandum on counterterrorism cooperation. It is extremely narrow in its focus. It has three sets of activities: intelligence information sharing, further cooperation between law enforcement agencies, and strengthening capabilities through networking, training and education, exchanges (high officials, analysts and field operators), seminars, conferences, and joint operations.
The importance of these activities and the MoU itself cannot be understated, but it is certainly time to question its impact so far and whether it can deal with the emerging challenges. In 2016, in a joint communique, the foreign ministers of the two countries noted success in “counterterrorism cooperation through the Jakarta Center for Law Enforcement Cooperation (JCLEC), including the sharing of intelligence and deradicalization of extremists.”
The Australian government says it is working with Indonesia on countering violent extremism (CVE). That is encouraging but it is also disappointing. The government of Australia has invested almost no money of any scale in that problem and funds negligible academic research on the topic. And there are now “fewer Australian students studying Indonesian at Year 12 level [last year of secondary school] than 40 years ago,” according to Professor Tim Lindsey of Melbourne University, speaking in May 2016.
Australia needs a new strategic approach to countering terrorism in Indonesia. The new strategy has to be focused on containment not defeat. While prevention is an admirable and essential objective of counterterror operations, it is also unachievable at a strategic level in the current geopolitical environment globally and the emerging political climate in Indonesia.
My June 16 article called for a strategy of containment of the Islamic State’s eventual successor without spelling out what that meant. In the context of Southeast Asia, and Australia in particular, such a new containment strategy is essential.
This will mean that Australia and the Southeast Asian Muslim states must recognize radical Islam more openly as a legitimate and inevitable political force and deal with it differently in order to contain its violent extremes. In one sense, this should not be hard. Radicalism is not a crime. It is a fundamental human right, enshrined in the concept of freedom of conscience, the only absolute human right of a political kind. But to take this stance explicitly would be very challenging for any Australian government. It would be to put into words and action President Barack Obama’s indirect refusal to label terrorists as “radical Muslims,” a position Donald Trump and many others find troubling.
The strategy of containment of communism pursued by the United States will not be an exact parallel. Islam is not a secular and atheistic ideology, but a great religion of the world. Moreover, the containment strategy will not be directed at Islam the religion but at the revolutionary states and violent movements that invoke Islam. My policy recommendation and challenge therefore is for governments to recognize and legitimize radical Islam more openly but defend against and contain the multiplying revolutionary and violent groups that act in its name. I would be proud to stand by their side as allies in that fight, even though I know I would share few of their specific beliefs. That diversity and the right to contest it peacefully is what we are jointly defending from the terrorist onslaught.

Know why the Democrats are making a big issue over President Trump exiting the Paris Climate Accord? It has nothing to with them being stewards of environmental issues. In fact, the environmental cause with most libs is nothing but a smokescreen.
Their whole purpose in lambasting Trump’s excusing himself is pure and simple. Cast all eyes on Trump and Americans will ignore Hillary Clinton’s email catastrophe. Leftists know what she pulled is worthy of prosecution, but mainstream media will not give it attention.
Liberals are the worst kind of hypocrites. As friends they stab you in the back and as a party they bring the attack on conservatives. Hillary was their poster child for the presidency, but they lost. So instead of being good sports, they create rhetoric and scandal where there never was one.
However, documents are continuing to be released illustrating the scoundrel Hillary was and still continues to be.
According to Judicial Watch:
On Thursday, 2,078 pages of documents were released, revealing more instances of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton sending and receiving classified information via an unsecured email server. They also show Clinton’s daughter Chelsea and others involved with the Clinton Foundation receiving special favors from Huma Abedin, the former secretary’s deputy chief of staff.
The new documents included 115 Clinton email exchanges not previously turned over to the State Department, bringing the known total to date to at least 432 emails that were not part of the 55,000 pages of emails that Clinton turned over to the State Department. These records further appear to contradict statements by Clinton that, “as far as she knew,” all of her government emails were turned over to the State Department.
Abedin continues to be a major player in the email scandal. She used her position multiple times to help those that financially supported the Clinton Foundation.
Others in Clinton’s office as Secretary of State thumbed their nose at secrecy and confidentiality. Maria Otero is a prime example of abusing her position in government service. These actions placed American security interests at risk. There is no excuse for that.
Prosecution needs to happen and stop wasting all the time on Congressional inquiries.The facts are clear.
DOJ Jeff Sessions has enough to appoint a special prosecutor to after Clinton, Abedin, Otero and others. No more messing around and put them behind bars.
How do you feel Clinton and her entourage should be dealt with at this stage of everything in regards to the email scandal?

"Trump’s net worth plunged by $1,000,000,000 thanks to New York’s fickle real estate market: report","21 Jun 2017 at 18:29 ET

Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story!
President Donald Trump claims his net worth to be $20 billion, but analysis by Bloomberg News says that that number is closer to $2.9 billion thanks to New York City’s current real estate market — which has taken major hits in recent years — and serious underperformance by three key Trump properties.
Caleb Melby said Wednesday that “the core of Trump’s empire” is comprised of buildings he bought and rebranded in the 1980s and 90s, but that when people are looking for new office space in Manhattan, Trump properties are low on the desirability list.
Melby looked at three Trump properties, all skyscrapers that Trump intended to rent as office space and all of which are “underperforming appraisals conducted when Trump was issued loans. The buildings — 40 Wall Street, Trump Tower, and 1290 Avenue of the Americas, a tower in which Trump holds a 30 percent stake — are victims of a changing New York office market, where gleaming new skyscrapers are attracting tenants and demand for space in vintage properties is falling.”
“That’s the biggest finding in an updated assessment of the president’s net worth,” Melby wrote, “which has slipped to $2.9 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, down from $3 billion a year ago. The calculation, five months after Trump’s inauguration, relies on figures compiled from lenders, mortgage documents, annual reports, market data and a new financial disclosure released June 16.”
Vanity Fair’s Bess Levin noted on Wednesday that Trump claimed in 2015 that he is worth more than $10 billion. Bloomberg claims that is actually a wildly inflated figure.
Melby said that the method used to determine Trump properties’ actual worth “previously relied in part on banks’ estimates and appraisals,” but now estimates their value based “solely on the three properties’ actual financial results disclosed by managers of mortgage-security trusts that hold Trump debt.”
The revised figure for the three towers plunged by $380 million.

Chickens Overshadow Trade Talks Between the U.S. and U.K.,"International trade deals are incredibly complicated, and often come down to minute details about specific products or services. In the case of a potential U.S-U.K. trade deal, it appears as if a major sticking point might be chicken.
Liam Fox, Britain’s international trade minister, is in Washington Monday for talks on the potential deal. The heat is on Fox from backers of Brexit; they want him to prove that Britain can make bilateral trade deals outside of the framework of the European Union.
To get the deal done, however, U.S. negotiators are making one key demand: American farmers wants to export cheap, chlorine-washed chicken to the United Kingdom. Right now, such exports are banned under EU rules.
A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Theresa May said it was too early to get into “specifics” or “hypotheticals” on what a possible trade deal with the United States would look like. Downing Street also said that food safety was among the highest priorities for British negotiators.
However, a source close to Fox told the U.K.’s Telegraph that “Americans have been eating it perfectly safely for years” and that any “meaningful” trade deal with the United States would have to include agriculture, even if British farmers object.
Those opposed to Britain’s decision to leave the EU are seizing on the poultry issue, arguing the U.K. is agreeing to lower food standards in the first major, potential deal with a foreign power.
“This row about chlorine chicken is a direct result of the government’s decision to leave the single market,” Ben Bradshaw, a Labour MP who is opposed to a hard Brexit, told the Guardian. “They are so desperate for new trade deals to make up for some of the losses that they seem ready to compromise on the safety of the food we eat.”
Fox, for his part, was cagey when asked about the chicken issue. After speaking at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, he refused to say whether he would eat a bird washed in chlorine.
“The British media are obsessed with chlorine-washed chickens, a detail of the very end stage of one sector of a potential free trade agreement,” Fox said, according to the Sun. “I say no more than that.”",Foreign Policy,0

Jeff Sessions Just Flat-Out Admitted He Hasn’t Recused Himself From The Russia Probe,"Back in June, when he testified under oath before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Attorney General Jeff Sessions assured everyone that he had fully recused himself from the Justice Department’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, declaring:
“I recused myself, not because of any asserted wrongdoing, or any belief that I may have been involved in any wrongdoing in the campaign. But because a Department of Justice regulation … I felt, required it.”
Such a virtuous little buttmuch, isn’t he?
However, in an interview Sessions recently gave to Fox News, it would appear that the AG hasn’t actually removed himself from the Russia probe as he said.
On Fox & Friends Friday, Sessions was asked quite specifically if he thought Special Counsel Robert Mueller had a conflict of interest because he’s a friend of former FBI Director James Comey. The Attorney General, who moonlights as a Keebler elf, replied:
“We need to clear the air on this and let the system work its will. Mr. Mueller is entitled lawfully I guess to hire who he desires but I think he should look for people who have strength and credibility by all people.”
If Sessions has truly recused himself from the matter, why didn’t he, as Rachel Stockman writes at LawNewz, merely say:
“I can’t comment because I have recused myself from the investigation.”
Former ethics attorney under George W. Bush, Richard Painter, had this to say about the Fox interview with Sessons:
Pressuring Mueller on Fox News violates recusal and is useless; he doesn't waste time watching Foxhttps://t.co/66Z9d7F40k via @politico
— Richard W. Painter (@RWPUSA) July 5, 2017
If a person is truly recused, and out of the loop, why not just say so and move on? Why did Sessions feel a need to say what he did? Might it be because he is still being briefed on the matter so he can then go to the White House and update his lord and master, President Trump?
Jeff Sessions is the most ethically-challenged person to ever serve as attorney general. That’s no surprise when you consider that he was appointed by a criminal president.

Video: Man with machete fights man with garbage can,"NEW YORK — An early morning fight with some unusual weapons was caught on video Wednesday, reports CBS New York.
The video, which was posted to Twitter, shows one man armed with a machete, and another with a street garbage can. The altercation takes place around a car driven by the man with a machete. A woman is with him. The video shows the woman getting into the passenger seat, and the man with the garbage can opening her door.
This appears to prompt the man with the machete to run around the car and throw his machete at the other man, who then throws the trash can at his adversary.
Now without his machete, the driver gets into the car but the man who had the trashcan pulls him out and the two exchange blows and throw objects at each other.
According to CBS New York, the man with the machete eventually drove off in a car but came back and was pulled over by police and taken into custody.
It is unclear what prompted the fight.

Barbra Streisand Bluntly States That Hillary Lost For One Reason And One Reason Only,"According to Barbara Streisand, there’s only one reason that Hillary Clinton lost to President Donald Trump… sexism. I think there are a whole lot of women out there that would take issue with that. Millions supported Trump for President. Babs is using her female bits again as an excuse for possibly the worst candidate in US history losing. She thinks women are underestimated… I would stridently disagree. As a woman, I see most women pretty much on a par with men anymore and I give more credence to the ability of the being than to gender.
Streisand may be an incredible singer and a great actress, but she is so politically partisan she comes across as a biased hack who thinks more with her gender in mind than using logic to determine actual cause and effect. Strong women are self-determined and take what they judge to be the best course of action. Women are the ones in the end that determined that Trump would be President and women were the ones that told the Hildabeast to take a hike. What Babs is referring to are Hollywood women – I guess because they resemble a different species.
Barbra Streisand, a Hillary Clinton supporter, says her candidate lost due to sexism.
“Women are still so underestimated; it’s incredible to watch even this last election with Hillary, the kind of strong woman, the powerful woman, the educated woman, the experienced woman, being thought of as the other, or too elite, or too educated,” she told WNYC’s Leonard Lopate on Wednesday.
“It’s very, very odd to me, and it was heartbreaking for her to lose, you know?” Adding that “power and woman has always been suspect. Strong women have always been suspect . . . in this country.”
I also resent the insinuation that women who voted for Trump are not educated or experienced. That’s an outright lie. Streisand was an adamant supporter of Hillary Clinton in the last election and has a special hatred for Donald Trump. She campaigned heavily for Clinton. But her sway isn’t what it used to be and even the approval of the Hollywood elite couldn’t push Hillary over the finish line.
As for Clinton being strong… she’s a corruptocrat and a monster. Not traits you want to see in a President. The leftist media keeps claiming that Clinton did better with women in the election, I find that hard to believe and very suspect. Consider the source. “There has long been a misconception that women voters vote by their gender identity instead of their party,” said Rutgers University’s Kelly Dittmar. “To try to talk about women as a single voting bloc, but to neglect to look at the crosstabs, to neglect to look at the differences in race, age, education, creates this false shock.” Agreed.
Kellyanne Conway got it right when she said the crux of the 2016 election was “between what offends you and what affects you.” This election wasn’t about sexism… it was about jobs and saying no to politicians. It was about national security and having pride in America again. Marxists like Streisand just don’t get it and never will.",Ihavethetruth,1

NYC subway train derailment injures dozens in Harlem,"June 27 (UPI) -- Dozens of riders were injured in Harlem Tuesday when a subway train derailed and careened into a wall, authorities said.
The Fire Department of New York and Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials said an A train derailed and hit a wall near 125th Street along St. Nicholas Avenue just before 10 a.m. Tuesday. The crash forced hundreds to crawl out of the derailed subway car on the tracks.
The accident spurred numerous transit delays and cancellations, as well, on the A, B, C, D, E, F and M lines.
The train derailed at a low rate of speed, NBC 4 New York reported. Nearly three dozen people were injured, the New York Daily News reported.

Two senior Republican senators criticize Tillerson comments on Russia,"U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Washington, U.S. June 21, 2017.
WASHINGTON Two senior Republican U.S. senators criticized Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Sunday for saying that Russia may have the ""right approach"" on Syria and for what they called his lack of focus on Afghanistan and Pakistan.
""His statements about Syria really disturb me. No, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin does not have it right when it comes to Syria,"" Senator Lindsey Graham said.
In separate television interviews, Graham and Senator John McCain, prominent Republican foreign policy voices, took aim at Tillerson's remarks last week that Russia may have ""got the right approach"" and the United States the wrong approach to Syria.
Russia has backed President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's civil war, while the United States supports rebel groups trying to overthrow him.
McCain told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" that he ""sometimes"" regretted backing Tillerson's nomination by Republican President Donald Trump and that his comments on Russia being ""right"" on Syria made him emotional and upset.
""I know what the slaughter has been like. I know that the Russians knew that Bashar Assad was going to use chemical weapons. And to say that maybe we've got the wrong approach?"" he said.
Both senators backed the nomination of Tillerson in January, even while expressing concern about his dealings with Russia when he was chief executive of ExxonMobil. (XOM.N)
Graham, who visited Afghanistan and Pakistan last week with McCain, accused Tillerson of being ""AWOL"" on the two countries and failing to fill key State Department posts.
""I am so worried about the State Department,” Graham said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""
A State Department official responded to the criticism of Tillerson by saying that a U.S.-Russian-brokered ceasefire for southwest Syria was an example of what the secretary had described as the potential to coordinate with Russia, in spite of unresolved differences, ""to produce stability and serve our mutual security interests.""
The official, who did not want to be identified, also said the State Department was taking an active role in a review of Afghanistan and Pakistan policy and continued to work with the White House on nominations.
Since the exit of most foreign troops in 2014, Afghanistan’s U.S.-backed government has lost ground to a Taliban insurgency in a war that kills and maims thousands of civilians each year.

“In the end time is going to kill us. The only thing that limits us is time. You can get another job or lover. But you can’t get more time,” said Jean O’Callaghan of University of Roehampton in London, regarding why she studies procrastination.Credit Whitten Sabbatini for The New York Times
CHICAGO — The shuttle driver got lost on the way to the 10th Procrastination Research Conference, threatening to derail the schedule. Still by 9:20 a.m. last Thursday, the 60 or so attendees had already completed check-in at DePaul University, welcome remarks and the first of dozens of presentations.
As they filed toward the coffee, their badges flashed their countries of origin — Germany, Turkey, Peru, India, Israel and Australia, among others.
“I remember when I couldn’t get anyone to talk about procrastination. Look at us now,” said Joseph R. Ferrari, a professor of psychology at DePaul and this year’s conference chairman, who has published four books on procrastination.
For the last 20 years, Dr. Ferrari and his colleagues have worked to create what attendees described as a much-needed setting for sharing and debating their research, without being made fun of.

“I’ve never been in another conference where people didn’t laugh or snicker when I announced what the title of my talk was,” said Joel Anderson, an associate professor in the department of philosophy and religious studies at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, one of a handful of philosophers who also do research in this niche field, dominated by psychologists and behavioral economists.

It is a conference built on the idea that precisely because procrastination is problematic for so many people, it is worthy of serious investigation.
Throughout the morning, Dr. Ferrari’s wife, Sharon, stood by the registration table, prepared to morph from greeter to guard if anyone tried to violate one of the meeting’s core rules:
“There’s no day-of registration,” she said.
Here is what we learned about who procrastinates, where they procrastinate and how to halt the loop of perpetual delay.
The 60 or so attendees at this year’s conference traveled from across the world to discuss the latest research on procrastination.Credit Whitten Sabbatini for The New York Times
20 percent of people are true procrastinators
Part of the challenge of studying procrastination is defining it.
Dr. Ferrrari, the conference organizer, defines procrastination as “the purposive and frequent delay in beginning or completing a task to the point of experiencing subjective discomfort, such as anxiety or regret.” His colleague Dr. Anderson says it is “culpably unwarranted delay.” At the simplest level, most researchers agree, you know it when you’re doing it.
One out of five people, researchers have found, fall into a category they call chronic procrastinators or procs (rhymes with crocs). The proc consistently procrastinates consistently in multiple areas of his or her life — work, personal, financial, social — in ways that attendees describe as wreaking havoc, undermining goals and producing perpetual shame. Researchers have built scales to separate the true proc from the occasional procrastinator. They assess not simply how often, but also the severity of consequences with prompts like:
■ I delay making decisions until it’s too late.
■ I am continually saying, “I’ll do it tomorrow.”
■ Putting things off until the last minute has cost me in the past year.
It is more complicated than “if you do it X number of times a week you’re a proc.” But if you procrastinate “almost every day, at least half of the time you have work tasks,” that is a solid hint that you qualify, said Julia Elen Haferkamp, a psychologist at the University of Münster in Germany.
“When it’s really procrastination, it’s more like a psychological disease,” said her colleague Stephan Förster, also a psychologist at the University of Münster.
He, and others who treat procs, spoke of broken marriages, lost jobs, deflated dreams, financial disarray and self-esteem issues.
But if 20 percent of the population procrastinates that much, is it definitely bad? One presenter, Jean O’Callaghan, a principal lecturer at the University of Roehampton in London, offered a more positive interpretation of this group, framing them as masters of idleness.
Continue reading the main story
“Maybe cultures need to learn how to do time differently and we can learn from procrastinators,” said Dr. O’Callaghan, who was the chairwoman of the 2005 conference. “To think out of the box about time and what it means to have a meaningful life? To have satisfaction? To have a sense of well-being? Or to produce a thousand articles?”
But Dr. Ferrari, who has published more research articles on procrastination than anyone else in psychology, does not agree that there is any upside to procrastination. (He has even published a few studies that work toward counteracting what he calls the “myth” that procrastinators perform better under last-minute pressure.)
“I’ve always made the argument that everybody procrastinates but not everyone’s a procrastinator because everybody may put off a task but that doesn’t make you a procrastinator,” said Joseph R. Ferrari, the conference chairman, who has published around 70 papers on procrastination.

Where is the proc capital of the world?
Pointing to a slide featuring Poland, Britain, Turkey and and Austria, Bilge Uzun, a research scientist at Bahcesehir University in Istanbul, asked, “Where do you think we find the most procrastinators?”
It was a trick question. She and her co-authors found that all countries surveyed had the same percentage: 20 percent, a finding reinforced by dozens of others studies over the years in Saudi Arabia, Germany, Japan and beyond.

And yet when Karem Diaz Cerna, a psychology professor at Pontifical Catholic University in Lima, surveyed her fellow Peruvians, she was convinced she was going to find an outlier.
“We thought, everything was so late there so the scales were not going to work,” she recounted.
But using a comparable questionnaire she also got about 20. Not just in Lima, the capital, but in all regions surveyed.
When Bill McCown, a research psychologist and associate dean at the University of Louisiana at Monroe, attended the first procrastination conference in 1997, there were some peculiar ideas floating around about procrastination.
“At the time, it’s just due to the American lifestyle and capitalism. That was one big one,” he recalled.
The presentations at the conference showed that the field has come a long way, but there was plenty of work to be done.
The researchers spend hours debating definitions of procrastination. The definition of Joel Anderson, left, a Dutch philosopher, is, “Culpably unwarranted delay.” Koroush Dini, right, a psychoanalyst, approved. “I like this, yeah. I think it’s one of the best definitions out there.”Credit Whitten Sabbatini for The New York Times
Asked to summarize their advice to the procs of the world, most attendees offered a version of the following: Accept that changing will require learning to manage your emotions and thinking more than figuring out how to manage your time. If it is a severe problem, consider working with a professional who understands procrastination. And for those who have A.D.H.D., the cycle of procrastination may operate differently than for those who do not.
Continue reading the main story
But what does the research say?
“Mostly that we need more consistent research,” said Wendelien Van Eerde, a professor at the faculty of economics and business at the University of Amsterdam, and a co-author of a meta-analysis of studies on interventions for procrastination.
Pushed further on what seemed to work best from the 16 of 989 studies that she felt comfortable comparing with one another, she offered, “C.B.T. mostly,” referring to cognitive behavioral therapy, which focuses on changing thought patterns, “followed by time management to some degree.”
And though most attendees at the conference said that they were convinced that chronic procrastination was curable, they also acknowledged that the evidence to back up that claim was not yet there.
Not all delay is procrastination
The conference ends the same way every two years. Researchers select the location for the next gathering.
At first, it seemed that this year’s decision would be a breeze. There were offers to host from Israel, Turkey and Britain.
But wait, some crucial people were missing. Maybe it would be better to figure it out over email?
The room grew tense.
Someone suggested a “steering committee.” Another advocated for a “neutral third party”
The shuttles were waiting. No consensus emerged. Just this once, it would have to wait.
“Oh, that’s not procrastination,” Dr. Ferrari said later. Based on his scientific definition, it counted only as “delay.”

John Boehner Lambastes Trump: ‘He Gets Into A Pissing Match With A Skunk Every Day’ On Twitter,"Former Speaker of The House John Boehner (R-Ohio) says our alleged president, Donald Trump, is his own worst enemy when it comes to his Twitter dust-ups with critics, according to The Hill.
“You never get into a fight with people who buy ink by the barrel. He does it every day.”
“Never get into a pissing match with a skunk. He does it every day.”
“It may have worked during the campaign. But I think he would do himself well if he would just slow the tweeting down and just focus on what he’s doing and not being critical.”
Boehner said Trump is a friend, and said he’s urging him to “quit tweeting” because he keeps “getting in his own way.”
“I mean, going after Mika Brzezinski or Joe Scarborough? What the hell is the point?” he asked, referring to Trump’s ridiculous attacks on the Morning Joe host’s appearance last month.
In one of his way-too-many Twitter meltdowns last month, Trump attacked Brzezinski, calling her “low IQ crazy Mika” and claiming he had seen her “bleeding badly from a face-lift.”
I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore). Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came..
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2017
…to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2017
(Continued after the advertisement.)
He also had a stern warning for the president, saying that if he keeps dividing the Republican Party and making them defensive, “they’re going to get annihilated” in the midterm elections, LGBTQ Nation reports.
And Boehner also noted that while he considers him a friend and a former campaign donor, Trump’s winning the election shocked him.
“I never really saw him as president. You all know what I mean.”
Trump is continually launching into what constitutes as a temper tantrum for adults. He explodes any time he thinks someone has just slighted him, and rarely pays any meaningful attention to his job.
It’s like watching the very worst episode of The Apprentice.
What’s really upsetting about this is that it’s an episode that may last four years.

SYDNEY, Australia — Dozens of Justine Damond’s closest friends and relatives gathered at sunrise on Freshwater Beach in Sydney on Wednesday, with candles and flowers in hand, to commemorate the life of a woman they described as a ray of light.
Horrified and sad, they said they could hardly believe that a woman so calm — a spiritual healer and meditation coach — had been fatally shot on Saturday night by a police officer in Minneapolis, where she was soon to be married.
“None of it makes sense,” said Michael Timbs, who lives in a coastal suburb near where Ms. Damond grew up. “To try and picture the scene and understand how he did that, I can’t get a sense of it.”
He swept his arm at the expanse of beach and glittering ocean. “You stand and look at this peaceful place,” he said, “and you think — it would have never happened here.”

All across Australia this week, similar sentiments were bursting into public view as the struggles over American policing — well known to so many in the United States — suddenly hit home for a country half a world away.
Continue reading the main story
Continue reading the main story
Law enforcement experts here have shaken their heads and criticized both police training in the United States and the American embrace of guns. One local newspaper put the death of Ms. Damond, 40, who also went by the name Justine Ruszczyk, on its front page with the headline: “American Nightmare.” And on Wednesday morning, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, appearing on television, asked a simple, if damning, question on the minds of many: “How can a woman out in the street in her pajamas seeking assistance from police be shot like that? It is a shocking killing.”

Ms. Damond’s loved ones, including her father, John Ruszczyk, who lives in Sydney, have said they were desperate for information about what happened. Her fiancé said she called 911 on Saturday night to report what she believed was an active sexual assault, only to end up dead at the hands of one of the officers who responded.
“Justine was a beacon to all of us,” Mr. Ruszczyk told reporters in Sydney on Tuesday. “We only ask that the light of justice shine down on the circumstances of her death.”
So far the Minneapolis police have said little. The officer involved was Mohamed Noor, 32, a Somali-American with only a couple of years on the force who is now on paid administrative leave.
The police said no weapon was found at the scene. Mr. Noor and the other officer who arrived with him did not turn on their body cameras, and the authorities have said that video cameras inside their patrol car also did not capture the shooting.
Both Mr. Noor and his lawyers have declined to comment. But the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension did provide one small detail on Tuesday night, saying Mr. Noor’s partner reported hearing a loud sound near their car shortly before the shooting — suggesting that the officers may have been startled.
In Australia, what’s driving much of the outrage is the extreme response, and just how common it seems to be. Ms. Damond was one of more than 500 people shot and killed by the police in the United States this year. And even when population differences are taken into account, that is far more than in Australia.
Continue reading the main story
Specifically, the number of people killed this year by the police in the United States is about five times the 105 killed by the police in Australia from 1989 through 2011, according to an extensive government study that is more comprehensive than anything compiled by law enforcement officials in the United States, where police departments are not necessarily required to report fatal shootings to any central authority.

Put another way, about four people are fatally shot by the Australian police each year, or one per six million people; in the United States, it is about one in 333,000, and that disparity is integral to the sense of bewilderment and fury in Australia.
#JustineDamond My heart aches for her family. Zero of what happened makes sense. The officer should be jailed for life, at least.
Vince Hurley, a criminologist at Macquarie University in Sydney, said the shooting partly reflected what he called American law enforcement’s aggressive training and reliance on firearms.
In Australia, he said, “the reason there have been less shootings is police now have a wider range of nonlethal weapons.” Pepper spray has been standard since the early 2000s, he said. Tasers have been deployed extensively over the past several years.
“When I joined, you had a gun and a baton and handcuffs,” he said, referring to 29 years with the police in New South Wales. “To use a gun might be overkill, but you had no choice because the baton wasn’t going to be sufficient, and the handcuffs were only once they were restrained.”
Many American police forces have also put Tasers and pepper spray in the hands of officers and have added training to help officers better assess threats and de-escalate potentially violent situations. Training and the culture in many police departments, however, still tend to focus on forcible responses to potential threats, and usually that means guns.
Many American officers, even in small towns, often speak of their deep fear of being shot.
“We’re trained for Armageddon,” said one officer in rural Connecticut when The New York Times sent reporters to ride along with the police across the United States last year. “We’re trained for the worst.”
In comparison, Mr. Hurley said: “Here in Australia, we wouldn’t do as much officer survival training. We would have an equal amount of focus on sociology, psychology and awareness of human behavior.”

Australians have also seen their government successfully manage mass shootings with public policy. After a gunman massacred 35 people in the Tasmanian town of Port Arthur in 1996, a public outcry spurred a national consensus to severely restrict firearms. The tightened laws, which were standardized across Australia, are more stringent than those of any state in the United States.
Continue reading the main story
As a result, while this is a country where guns are deeply tied to history — where police officers have carried guns since the First Fleet from England arrived — there is little tolerance for the American idea that possession of guns should be treated more as a right than a threat.
“Australians don’t associate guns with freedom,” said Gabby Timbs, Mr. Timbs’s wife. If a similar incident happened in her country, she said, “Australians wouldn’t stand for that.”
“For us it’s more wonderment than anger — it’s the shock of not understanding why you have guns in a community like that.”
A mood of peace and sorrow mostly defined Wednesday’s quiet oceanside tribute, which attracted nearly 200 people.
But afterward, Sam Lucia, 41, an old school friend of Ms. Damond, said the details of her death were all the more painful because of what a peaceful life she had lived.
She was a trained veterinarian, with a degree from the University of Sydney. She was a spiritual healer and meditation coach, focused always on bringing people peace.
“She was a beautiful person who didn’t deserve to die,” Ms. Lucia said, crying. “When you put it into the context of knowing her, it’s even more devastating.”

Reebok mocks Trump's compliments of Macron's wife,"The sports brand Reebok is mocking President Trump’s compliments of French President Emmanuel Macron’s wife that were made during Trump's visit to France last week.
The sports apparel company posted a graphic to their Twitter account on Friday.
In a chart, labeled “when is it appropriate to say, ‘You’re in such good shape…beautiful,’” several scenarios are listed, including “Are you a world leader greeting the spouse of a head of state?” and “Are you in an elevator with a woman?"" In response, the company advises: “No.”

Cabinet tensions rise as West Wing goes through (another) shakeup,"John King, CNN Chief National Correspondent

Inside Trump's personnel battles
Inside Trump's personnel battles 03:45
* The dust hasn't settled from the White House shakeup: Tillerson, McMaster and Scaramucci all figures to watch
* The presidential travel schedule is telling, but what's unknown is what he'll talk about while on the road
Washington (CNN)Several lingering personnel challenges facing the President, the mounting frustration of GOP congressional leaders and an August travel schedule that might make it easier for White House handymen -- it's all covered in our Inside Politics forecast.
1) Kelly is in -- but other staff and Cabinet tensions remain
Hiring a new chief of staff doesn't mean the Trump administration's personnel tensions are over.
Reince Priebus out, John Kelly in as White House chief of staff
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is frustrated at what he views as White House meddling in policy decisions that should be his. Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, is not always on the same page as Tillerson -- or top White House strategist Stephen Bannon. Then there is the President's open frustration with Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
Michael Bender of The Wall Street Journal also noted the question of how the new chief of staff and his disciplined military approach will mesh with the brash new communications director, Anthony Scaramucci.
""He's got to figure out if he's got to rein in Anthony Scaramucci. Is he going to stop belittling Jeff Sessions?""
""Rex Tillerson is very frustrated that the White House is running more and more of the foreign policy out of the White House -- and H.R. McMaster, he's not gelling with Tillerson, he's not gelling with Steve Bannon and has been rebuffed by the President himself on request for modest increases in troops in Afghanistan,"" Bender said.
2) Recess appointments advice close at hand for President
Key GOP members of Congress made clear to President Trump this week that they wanted him to back off his criticism of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and just as clear they were in no mood to consider a replacement.
Trump urged to use recess appointment to replace Sessions -- is that possible?
One option the President has discussed with some advisers is his power to make a recess appointment when the Senate is not in session.
Republicans are warning the President against such a strategy.
Michael Warren of The Weekly Standard noted there are two experts on the issue in the Trump administration. But there's a twist:
""Two of the top lawyers in the administration are somewhat of experts on this topic. Noah Francisco, who is in the Department of Justice right now. He's the nominee to be solicitor general and James Burnham, who's one of the White House counsel lawyers, they both argued in front of the Supreme Court two years ago actually against the Obama administration and their attempt to make recess appointments,"" Warren said.
""Those were some people that I imagine the President is, you know, calling on for counsel on what to do if he decides to go ahead and do a recess appointment.""
3) The President plans August travel -- but where?
President Trump wants to get out of Washington a fair amount in August, spending some time traveling the country as well as at his New Jersey golf resort.
Where the President goes is an open question -- as is whether we will see a different approach.
We know the President loves campaign-style ralles.
But CNN's Sara Murray notes there has been a flood of GOP criticism that Trump has not used his travels, and his bully pulpit, to advance key policy initiatives. ""The thing to watch is whether the President has learned any lessons from this health care defeat,"" Murray remarks.
""What does he do when he is on the road? Does he try to sell specific agenda items? Does he try to sell specific elements of tax reform? Or do we get the same sort of kitchen sink, slam at the media, rants about whatever he's feeling that day and maybe do a little hat tip to tax reform along the way?""
4) Trouble at the top? Allies of the speaker and the majority leader describe mounting frustration
Relations between President Trump and the top two Republicans in Congress, never warm and fuzzy, appear to be taking a turn for the worse.
Speaker Paul Ryan and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are both described by close colleagues and allies as frustrated by presidential behavior they find unhelpful, not to mention unpredictable. Nothing new there, really, but the cumulative effect -- and the calendar -- are adding weight to the dynamic.
Donald Trump's DC swamp purge is really picking up speed
The White House openly and forcefully beat back a top Ryan priority in tax reform negotiations, plus Ryan ally, Reince Preibus, was just forced out as White House chief of staff.
For McConnell, the weekend included a series of presidential tweets suggesting GOP senators were fools for not passing an Obamacare repeal plan and that the leader was not making the best use of his power.
In public, the leaders tend to be polite when it comes to the President. And as they worry about his dismal approval ratings and its impact on the 2018 midterms, neither is under the illusion the President is going to change his ways. But Ryan and McConnell allies are more vocal in their criticism of the President, which is telling.
Take the weekend tweeting of John Holmes, a former McConnell chief of staff who remains loyal to the majority leader.
Responding to the President's tweets offering Senate strategy advice to McConnell, Holmes countered: ""Instead of searching for the leaker, search for the idiot who keeps putting the President on irrelevant and counterproductive crusades.""
5) Know a good handyman? The White House has some work coming
New Chief of Staff John Kelly can expect his first month on the job to be loud -- even if his arrival calms the West Wing infighting that has plagued the Trump White House from the beginning.
A busy schedule of summer maintenance is on tap, and getting underway just as Kelly takes his prime West Wing real estate.
Margaret Talev of Bloomberg Politics detailed some of the coming fixes that will add to Kelly's transition challenge.
""They're doing repairs to the HVAC system -- which is 27 years old so it needs to be replaced. There was a leak in the roof the other day. They've got to do paint, carpeting, wiring, so all of these offices are going to move temporarily to the EEOB (Eisenhower Executive Office Building),"" Talev said.
""So on top of all the actual structural challenges, he's going to have some geographic challenges as well.""",CNN – Politics,0
Is Nancy Pelosi worth the trouble?,"June 26, 2017 9.31pm EDT
A recent poll found Nancy Pelosi’s favorability at 39 percent – about on par with Trump’s.

A recent poll found Nancy Pelosi’s favorability at 39 percent – about on par with Trump’s.
Democrats in Congress are struggling to keep up a unified front.
As the minority party, Democrats have spent the past six months standing by, mostly powerless, as President Donald Trump has made haphazard progress toward dismantling many of former President Barack Obama’s key accomplishments.
Last week the party suffered another blow: a bitter defeat in a special election in Georgia’s Sixth Congressional District. That made four special elections – out of four – they have lost since Election Day in November.
These losses all occurred in Republican strongholds, but Democrats were hoping for victories that would signal dissatisfaction with Trump’s presidency and bolster their momentum. Helping the GOP win in these hard-fought elections were ads attacking House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s “San Francisco liberalism.” Looking ahead to the 2018 midterms, Pelosi’s long tenure as leader also poses a challenge to Democrats trying to make the case that they are the party of change.
As a political scientist who focuses on gender and party discipline in the House of Representatives, I have studied Pelosi’s long leadership. I think it is especially interesting to compare Speaker Paul Ryan’s recent struggle to persuade enough Republicans to support the American Health Care Act with Pelosi’s significant role in building a coalition to pass the Affordable Care Act.
In the past week, some frustrated House Democrats have suggested that Pelosi step down, calling into question her leadership, the party’s agenda and even the Democratic brand.
A defiant Pelosi reacted by calling a press conference and declaring: “I think I’m worth it.”
Is she? Let’s look at her record.
Pelosi’s rise to power and leadership are characterized by her intense partisanship, fundraising prowess and intraparty coalition-building.
Elected to the House in 1987, she won her first leadership race as party whip in October of 2001, defeating Steny Hoyer of Maryland by a vote of 118-95. As minority leader, Pelosi established a reputation as a pragmatist who enforced party discipline.
Fast forward to the 2006 elections, with Democrats gaining 30 seats and majority party control. Taking the gavel at the start of the 110th Congress, Pelosi became the first female speaker of the House, presiding over an 84 percent male chamber.

Serving as speaker from 2007 to 2010, Pelosi benefited from the centralization of party leaders’ power that occurred during the previous 12 years of GOP control of the House.
As she stepped into the leadership role in 2007, Pelosi had more tools and prerogatives than her Democratic predecessors, Tip O'Neill, Jim Wright and Tom Foley. That’s because under Republican speakers Newt Gingrich and Dennis Hastert, the shift of power away from committee chairs to party leaders – a change that had been taking place since the Democratic reforms of the 1970s – picked up speed. For example, Republicans instituted six-year term limits on committee chairs in 1995 that remain in effect. Selected by a party leadership-led steering committee, Republican committee chairs are not always the most senior majority member on the committee. They are typically members who display their party loyalty with their voting records and fundraising.
As speaker, Pelosi maximized her influence, setting the legislative agenda, pursuing partisan policy initiatives and fundraising for her colleagues. As I argue in my book, Democratic committee chairs, grateful to return to the majority, were willing to cede power to party leaders.
For the most part, Pelosi worked hard to build consensus within her party and shut Republicans out of the process. She frequently met with freshmen and more moderate and conservative Democrats to find common ground on the party agenda.
Under her leadership, House Democrats voted on average with the majority of their caucus 92 percent of the time in 2007 and 2008, setting a record for party cohesion.
When Obama was first elected in 2008, the Democrats gained unified party control of the White House and both chambers of congress. Pelosi had a new challenge: building coalitions to pass the president’s ambitious agenda items – like health care and financial regulatory reform – rather than the easier job of simply attacking a Republican president’s proposals.
Pelosi’s role in the passage of the Affordable Care Act can hardly be overstated.
She brought Democrats together to start the process in the House before Obama became deeply involved. Three House committees marked up the bill which Pelosi then assembled. When key House Democrats threatened to withdraw their support over disagreements related to abortion funding, Pelosi appeased them and built consensus to attract enough votes to pass the bill. And when it seemed that the House and Senate would not be able to reconcile their versions after Senate Democrats lost their 60 vote filibuster-proof majority with the election of Republican Scott Brown of Massachusetts, Pelosi’s leadership was critical in crafting and executing a complicated legislative strategy that resulted in the bill that Obama ultimately signed into law.
House Democrats were largely unified on other votes as well, with the average member voting with the majority 91 percent of the time in 2009 and 89 percent in 2010.
But Obama’s legislative successes held a cost during the 2010 midterm elections. Democrats lost 64 seats. Republicans gained a 242 to 193 majority, their best showing since 1946.
Back in the minority, Pelosi was reelected as Democratic leader in 2011, defeating North Carolina centrist Heath Shuler by a caucus vote of 150-43. In a sign of dissatisfaction, 19 Democrats did not support her in the vote on the House floor.
On Jan. 3 of this year, all but four Democrats voted to reelect Pelosi as their leader for the eighth time. However, this show of Democratic unity on the House floor masked the uneasiness on display during the party’s internal contest between Pelosi and relatively unknown seven-term Democrat Tim Ryan of Ohio in late November. Pelosi prevailed, 134 to 63 – hardly a ringing endorsement.
As the 115th Congress got underway, Pelosi pledged to seek common ground with President-elect Trump on job creation, trade and support for working families. She also warned that “If there is an attempt to destroy the guarantee of Medicare, harm Medicaid, Social Security, or the Affordable Care Act, Democrats will stand our ground.”
Not surprisingly, with deep policy divides and intense competition between the parties, finding that common ground has been elusive. Without the votes to advance the Democrats’ agenda in the House, criticizing Republican policies is the best way for Pelosi to get attention.
In the upcoming midterms, Democrats will need a united front and they’ll need money to win seats in the House. They are unlikely to forget how Pelosi can draw upon her vast connections to raise record amounts. According to The New York Times, Pelosi has raised nearly US$568 million for her party since entering the House Democratic leadership in 2002. Just in the 2016 election cycle, she raised over $141 million.
Viewed through that lens, I would argue she may be ‘worth it.’
Yet House Democrats in swing districts may decide that it is too challenging to make the case for change with Pelosi as their leader. If Pelosi’s vote-counting history is a guide, she will know if and when that time has come.

Melania Ditches President Trump At G20 Banquet To Sit With Vladimir Putin Instead,"So this is…strange. At the G20 leaders banquet, First Lady Melania Trump clearly left President Trump, to go sit and chat with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin and Melania were all smiles too, as they met and shook hands in front of the press.
The clip and screenshots below, clearly show Melania seated away from Trump, with Putin. We also see President Trump sit down with a different group of leaders, while motioning over and acknowledging that Melania was sitting with Putin. All anyone needs to know, is that the First Lady has no business having a conversation with the leader personally responsible for hacking our election last year.
And important to note, is where Trump was hanging out after Melania went and sat with Putin. He went and found his Saudi Arabian friends! Probably to talk about all those weapons he sold them.
President Trump and Melania seem to think that after the President palled around with Putin today and got along great during their two hour meeting, that we are now allies with Russia. Apparently it is now appropriate for the First lady to sit and have dinner with our number one enemy. At minimum, the Trumps are horribly naive about the situation they are in. These people are our legitimate enemies.

Lawsuit Filed As IRS Government Corruption Goes Too Far In Michigan,"Posted by Georgette Walrath | Jul 18, 2017 | Liberal Corruption
In Michigan, the state government is using back taxes to seize properties, sell them, and pocket the difference. A new appeal to the Supreme Court hopes to stop it.
The state of Michigan is drawing the notice of the Supreme Court for its theft of private citizen’s homes. A lawsuit filed by the Pacific Legal Foundation is asking that the highest court in the land weigh in on the long-term abuses.
The state government has been seizing the property of residents who owe pay back taxes. Once the property is sold, the county has been pocketing the proceeds, sometimes in excess of $150,000 per instance.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case are petitioning the Supreme Court for help in overcoming the flagrant misuse of power and state confiscation.
Since not many people who are having trouble paying taxes can afford to hire someone to help, the case was brought to the attention of attorneys when Van Buren County confiscated a church camp’s property for failure to pay. Although religious non-profit businesses are exempt from most taxes, the camp apparently wasn’t.
Even though they maintained the property for inner-city kids in Chicago’s South Side, the county maintained the tax regulation and seized the property.
Henderson Hodgens lost his 20-acre farm for back taxes, but the county netted thousands more from the subsequent sale.
Under state law, the county took possession of the land and sold it for $206,000. However, the amount owed for taxes was only $16,000. Van Buren kept the additional $109,000 and added it to the county coffers.
When the case was brought before the court of appeals, the ruling went 2-1, with one judge siding with the church. Judge Raymond Kethledge wrote in his dissent, “In some legal precincts that sort of behavior is called theft.”
“But under the Michigan General Property Tax Act, apparently, that behavior is called tax collection. The question here is – or at least in my view should be – whether the county’s action is a taking under the federal Constitution,” the judge wrote.
In addition to Hodgens, Wayside Church lost a camp for inner city kids when they missed their $16,000 bill. The city gained nearly $200,000 from the sale of the camp and added the money to their coffers.
The other appeals court justice officials said that their district court lacked the jurisdiction to rule on the matter and that the plaintiffs must seek an answer in Michigan state court.
The Wayside church wasn’t the only victim of this sort of seizure and theft. Two other individuals are named in the lawsuit. Myron Stahl lost a residential lot, and Henderson Hodgens lost his 20-acre farm and home.
Hodgens explained that he waits each year for his refund check before paying his property taxes. However, in 2011 he had hard times. Without the money to pay, Van Buren County immediately confiscated the farm that had been in his family “forever.”
Van Buren Treasurer Karen Makay told reporters, “We are not confiscating property.” Then she said that the county confiscates property to take ownership, and then sells all of the properties together. Makay admitted that many homes and land sell for more than the tax liability owed, but nevertheless, the county keeps the remainder.
She haughtily confirmed that since the county now owns the property, they can do whatever they want with it.
Many people see how wrong this is. Christina Martin of the Pacific Legal Foundation said, “Michigan’s General Property Tax Act allows bureaucrats to take more than their due when they go after people for unpaid property taxes.”
Van Buren County officials say that the properties are forfeit and therefore they can sell them for however much they want.
“In other words,” she added, “this law transforms the foreclosure process into an engine of government sanctioned theft in order to line government coffers. That’s unjust and unconstitutional.”
All totaled, the county netted $275,000 after the taxes were deducted from the sales. The government “enrichment” being used in Van Buren County is outrageous.
According to the Fifth Amendment, the government is prevented from seizing “private property… for public use, without just compensation.” Lawyers for the plaintiffs say that thousands of properties are confiscated each year in Michigan, creating quite a windfall for liberal leaders.
In America’s free society, the government isn’t supposed to have the ability to claim land and possessions in excess of what is owed. However, that’s exactly what it’s doing in Michigan, Arizona, Minnesota, Massachusetts, North Dakota and Oregon. A Supreme Court ruling is necessary to protect individual liberty and private ownership.",Conservative Daily Post,1

The parents of terminally ill Charlie Gard spoke about their hope that the courts will reverse course and allow their 11-month-old son to receive experimental treatment in the United States.
This is an undated hand out photo of Charlie Gard provided by his family, at Great Ormond Street Hospital, in London.(Photo: AP)
LONDON — A British court decided Monday to give the parents of 11-month-old Charlie Gard 48 hours to present new evidence to prove that the terminally ill baby should receive experimental treatment in the United States or another country.
Judge Nicholas Francis of Britain's High Court gave the couple until Wednesday afternoon to turnover medical evidence that they claim has a chance of improving, although not curing, Charlie's condition. If Chis Gard, 32, and Connie Yates, 31, do so then Monday's hearing will resume Thursday.
Charlie suffers from a rare condition called mitochondrial depletion syndrome that has caused brain damage and left him unable to move. He can only breathe with a ventilator.
Great Ormond Street Hospital, which has cared for Charlie since October, was scheduled to turn off the baby’s life support systems on June 30 because his British doctors concluded that an experimental treatment proposed by a neurologist in the U.S. would not ease his suffering or improve his condition.
But that move is against his parents' wishes and in Britain it is the courts, not the family, who decide how to proceed if there is a medical dispute.
The hospital applied for the new court hearing because the parents said there was new evidence from Italian researchers at the Vatican’s children’s hospital and another facility outside of Britain showing the experimental therapy was worth pursuing.
A lawyer for the family argued in Monday's hearing that the new evidence suggested that the treatment could lead to a ""clinical improvement,"" although an attorney acting for Great Ormond Street Hospital challenged whether the evidence was really new.
""What I think a lot of people can't get their head around is that we are not allowed to take our son from one hospital to another one to possibly save his life,"" the boy's father, said in an interview with USA TODAY on Sunday.
""It's not just that we think we know best,"" added Charlie's mother. ""There are other doctors in America and around the world now who think it is worth a chance. While Charlie's still fighting, we are still fighting.""

Saving Charlie Gard: Fight for terminally ill British child goes on
Parents, Trump and the pope make last-ditch attempt to save a dying British baby
""We have a different perspective, or at least emphasis, on things like autonomy and the proper role of parents in decision-making for their children,"" said G. Kevin Donovan, an expert on bio-medical ethics and a professor at Georgetown University Medical School in Washington, D.C.
""Physicians in the U.S. would argue that even though little Charlie has a grim prognosis, there might some hope or benefit by intervening with experimental therapy,"" Donovan said.
A U.S.-based neurologist, identified in legal documents only as Dr. I because of court restrictions, is willing to try an experimental treatment that he admits is unlikely to work on Charlie and has not been tested — even on animals.
But several court rulings have prevented the parents from taking up the offer because the boy's British doctors don't think the therapy would improve his quality of life and could even cause him further pain.
However, the parents think it is a risk worth taking and have raised more than $1.6 million to have Charlie treated in the U.S. or another country.
Britain's High Court ruled in April that Charlie's doctors agreed that the child should be taken off life support systems and given ""palliative care only and that he should be allowed to die peacefully and with dignity.""
In his ruling, Justice Francis cited testimony from Dr. I, who conceded that Charlie is unlikely to improve with the experimental therapy, but he would still treat the boy.
Charlie's case was thrust into the global spotlight when Trump tweeted that if the U.S. could help, ""we would be delighted to do so."" And the pope said the Vatican's hospital was also willing to take the boy. Pope Francis said he hoped Charlie's parents would be allowed to ""care for their child until the end.""
U.S. Reps. Brad Wenstrup, R-Ohio, and Trent Franks, R-Ariz., said they will introduce a bill this week in the House of Representatives, calling for Charlie and his parents to be given U.S. residence status so their son can receive treatment.

The U.S. Navy Wants 20 New Guided-Missile Frigates,"The U.S. Navy has begun the process of acquiring a new guided-missile frigate, several years after decommissioning the last of its old Perry-class FFGs.
On July 10, 2017, Naval Sea Systems Command formally asked the U.S. shipbuilding industry to propose designs for a new guided-missile frigate that the Navy is calling the FFG(X).
The Navy wants to buy 20 of the ships between 2020 and 2030. The frigates would replace at least 20 of the Littoral Combat Ships that the sea service previously planned to acquire. The LCS has come under fire for being too lightly-armed for independent patrols in contested waters.
“The FFG(X) will normally aggregate into strike groups and large-surface-combatant-led surface action groups but also possess the ability to robustly defend itself during conduct of independent operations,” the request for information explains.
The FFG(X) would build upon the LCS’s capabilities — and could even share a hull with the earlier class. Like the LCS, the new frigate should function as a mothership for various unmanned vehicles — flying, tethered and subsurface — in order to “gather information and then act as a gateway to the fleet tactical grid using resilient communications systems and networks.”
But the frigate must carry more and heavier weaponry than the LCS does. Both LCS variants — Austal’s Independence-class trimaran and Lockheed Martin’s Freedom-class mono-hull design — possess no long-range air-defense capability.
Lacking heavy anti-air missiles, the LCS is dependent on destroyers and cruisers for protection in the most intensive combat. Likewise, the LCS cannot adequately protect other vessels from air attack, limiting its usefulness as a convoy escort.
The FFG(X) would address that shortfall. “The Navy is particularly interested in understanding the trade space surrounding the addition of launcher capability to support Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile Block 2 and/or Standard Missile-2 active missiles,” the request for information states.
As a bonus, the same launchers might lend the FFG(X) greater surface-to-surface punch than the LCS possesses. As originally designed, the LCS lacked a heavy anti-ship missile. As a gap-filler, the Navy has installed four launch-canisters for Harpoon surface-to-surface missiles on some forward-deploying LCSs.
By contrast, the request for information on the new frigate asks shipbuilders to consider whether heavy surface-to-surface missiles could be “cost-effectively integrated” into the same launch systems that, at a minimum, must be compatible with ESSM or Standard anti-air missiles.
To get the new FFG(X) into the fleet by the mid-2020s, the Navy wants industry to propose variants of existing designs. Lockheed and Austal could propose bigger versions of their LCS models. Huntington-Ingalls might offer a frigate version of the National Security Cutter it builds for the U.S. Coast Guard.
Foreign designs could also be candidates, provided their builders can find U.S.-based partners in order to satisfy regulations that require the Pentagon to source weaponry from American industry.
It’s unclear how much an FFG(X) might cost. Baseline LCSs set back U.S. taxpayers around $500 million apiece.
As of mid-2016 the Navy had a requirement for 52 small surface combatants as part of an overall fleet of around 300 frontline warships. Based on that requirement, by the 2030s the Navy could operate 32 LCSs and 20 FFG(X)s.
But Pres. Donald Trump and some lawmakers and senior military leaders want to boost the fleet to at least 350 ships. In that case, the number of small surface combatants might also increase.
Not coincidentally, the Navy has floated the idea of bringing back into service a small number of recently-decommissioned Perry-class frigates as an expedient way of growing the fleet.

Here Are America’s Most Underfunded Corporate Pensions,"July 21, 2017July 21, 2017 Christopher Kemmett 0 Comments
We spend a lot of time talking about the public pension crisis because, well, it’s a massive $5 – $8 trillion dollar overhang on the economy and one which will undoubtedly result in some heartache for investors at some point in the future. Unfortunately, there are some problems that are too large for even U.S. taxpayers to fix and, with an underfunding of $52,000 (mid-point) per household, somehow we suspect this is one of them.
Of course, our nation’s various governmental institutions aren’t the only ones to have unwittingly created massive ponzi schemes from which there is no escape. In fact, as Bloomberg points out today, as of the end of 2016 over 90% of the top 200 corporate pensions in the S&P were unfunded to the tune of $382 billion.
Here’s a look at the funded status of the top 20:
Meanwhile, just the top 20 corporate pension funds are underfunded by over $100 billion.
So what happens when these massive corporate obligations become so underfunded that they can’t possibly ever be fixed? As the 400,000 pensioners in the Central States Pension Plans are all too familiar, the obligations get handed over the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), an entity which is nearly bankrupt itself, at which point payouts are slashed leaving retirees with about half of the monthly income they expected in retirement. Per CBS:
February was a bad month for Larry Burruel and thousands of other retired Ohio iron workers. His monthly take-home pension was cut by more than half from $3,700 to $1,600.
Things have been rough in the Rust Belt, but this was a particularly powerful punch in the pocketbook for Burruel, who started in the trade at 19 and worked 36 years before opting for early retirement to make way for younger workers. Unfortunately, this sagging industry doesn’t have enough younger workers to pay for retirees like Burruel, whose pension plan is in what the U.S. Treasury Department calls “critical and declining status.”
Burruel and the 400,000 members of his Central States Pension Fund are the canaries in the coal mine as far as pension cutbacks go. At least 50 Midwestern pension plans — mostly the kind jointly administered by trustees for a labor union and a group of employers — are in this decrepit condition. Several plan sponsors have already applied to the Treasury Department to cut back retirees’ allotments.
This cross-section of America includes more than a million former truck drivers, office and factory employees, bricklayers and construction workers who are threatened with cutbacks that could last the rest of their lives.
Who could have guessed that the efforts of our government and largest corporations to backstop the investing risk of millions of households across the country would end so poorly?

"Science, Sensationalized: How the Press Undermines Research Funding","“Killer T cells (green and red) surround a cancer cell (blue, center)” –NICHD via Flickr
In mid-March, the Trump administration released its proposed budget for 2018. It included deep cuts to federal scientific agencies such as the National Institutes of Health. In its current form, the bill is unlikely to pass through Congress without a fight, as research funding has traditionally received bipartisan support.
Yet these figures—including a staggering 18 percent cut to the NIH—should be a source of immense concern not only to scientists, but to anyone who cares about public health, evidence-based reasoning, or the preservation of the United States’ status as a mecca of research and intellectual activity. Even in the absence of outright hostility to science—of which there seems to be no shortage in the current administration—if lawmakers fail to keep research funding a priority, we will all lose out.
Judging by the flurry of coverage following the cuts, one would guess that these decreases were unprecedented. But researchers know that funding has been tight over the past eight years. According to a Science Magazine editorial, the NIH’s 2012 budget funded 18 percent less research than in 2004, and budget sequestration mandated by the Budget Control Act of 2011 has continued to reduce research funding since then.
Unfortunately, rather than illuminating the inner workings of the scientific enterprise or explaining science’s importance as an institution, mainstream news publications tend to instead leverage its superficial narrative potential. At a result of these practices, science is consistently reduced to a political conflict over a grab bag of flashpoint issues. This distorted coverage crucially omits the centrality of federal funding to science’s mission of discovery, a search for the truth, and improvements to the human quality of life.
Back to the Basics
In order to recognize why media coverage of federal funding has been lacking, it is important to understand why federal funding is important. Research exists on a continuum, and some slants of research are inherently less compatible with private funding. At one end, basic science aims to understand the natural world at a fundamental level and has few immediately clear applications. On the other end is translational research, which “translates” the fundamental discoveries of basic research into methods for the treatment and prevention of disease, or other real-world applications.
In an interview with the HPR, George Daley, dean of Harvard Medical School, describes how basic research can lead to translational successes: “One of my colleagues, Bob Horvitz, did research on a very primitive worm called C. elegans … He studied it from a pure curiosity-driven perspective. He identified mutations that caused certain cells to survive, and that allowed him to define the genetic pathway of programmed cell death.” Daley explained that one of these genes was later found to be related to a human lymphoma gene. Many years down the line, Horvitz’s original “curiosity-driven” research—which at the time had no clear applications—led to the development of lifesaving drugs.
Thus, to promote advances in public health and the treatment of disease, we must support a diverse portfolio of research. This includes both the translational research that leads directly to treatments, and the basic research that provides the fundamental understanding necessary for translation.
The crucial basic research that eventually leads to public health improvements, however, often years down the road, may not have immediate therapeutic relevance at the time it is conducted. As a result, private sources such as pharmaceutical companies are often less likely to fund basic research. “When companies fund science, they tend to be much more focused and mission-oriented,” said Daley. “When the NIH funds science, they certainly have their mission-oriented efforts, but they are also inclined to fund very basic work.” Basic research yields great discoveries, but it requires an expensive long-term investment that is not always profitable for companies.
Even when it’s possible to shift away from federal funding to private sources like foundations, there are additional issues to consider. A reliance on private funding can result in deference to donor priorities. “The NIH allows you to pick a topic … and spend a career trying to chip away at it,” Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health professor Sara Bleich told the HPR, “whereas if you are in the foundation world, you sort have to bunny hop from topic to topic depending on what’s being funded … and often where discovery comes from is really intricate knowledge of a single topic.”
The stakes are clear: basic research is our primary means of understanding the world around us and a cornerstone of public health. In addition to scientific discovery, ample research funding is integral to maintaining American preeminence in academia. As Harvard Chan School assistant professor Michael Barnett puts it, “Funding for basic science is what powers the engines of our most productive elite universities and research enterprises that attract the most talented intellectuals, scientists, and engineers from across the world.”
But in the media, the “hive mind” of science, a thriving ecosystem of researchers suckled on the bosom of federal funding, is stripped of its institutional beauty and reduced to a cheap political sideshow—a mildly interesting narrative to tell when sexier topics like immigration, gun control, and the economy are having an off day. This coverage overemphasizes a handful of issues and politicizes the topic of science, pulling it into partisan firefights that obscure important discussions on funding of research.
For instance, after Trump’s election in November, news organizations sensed a juicy narrative and jumped on it. Capitalizing on post-election uncertainty, outlets published a flood of articles speculating on Trump’s potential actions on science. As if the entire issue of “science” could be boiled down to climate change and other hot topics, discussion of funding for federal agencies like the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation was either omitted or mentioned as an afterthought.
A particularly egregious Washington Post piece titled, “Trump and Pence on science, in their own words” listed quotes on scientific issues organized into headings by topic. These included “climate change,” “vaccines and autism,” “Ebola,” “wind farms,” “lightbulbs and cancer,” “the ozone layer,” “fracking,” and “Pence on evolution.” In the entire article, there was no mention of federal funding, the NIH, or the NSF. The author dedicated an entire paragraph to discussing the merits of compact fluorescent lamps, yet research funding received no mention.
The distillation of “science” down to a grab bag of politicized issues only fortifies the perception that caring about science simply entails having the “correct” positions on a laundry list of important political issues. Implicitly, a checklist representation of science reinforces the erroneous notion that science does not require a strong and sustained commitment. This politicized, narrative-based and hot-topic coverage allows the public to ignore the dearth of research funding. It fails to make readers aware of the immense importance of public research funding in an age where anti-intellectualism is pervasive, yet supporting scientific discovery remains as important as ever.
Public Opinion, Political Capital
In a Politico article in the wake of Trump’s election, Bill Scher wrote, “A majority of public opinion can mean more than a majority in Congress.” This sentiment should remind us that to rejuvenate federal funding of research, it’s vital to educate and engage the public. Issues like climate change, evolution, and cancer receive a huge amount of public attention, and for this reason they are addressed by lawmakers. To protect federal science funding, the public needs to be outraged when the NIH might receive an 18 percent cut.
Some may question whether adversaries of research funding actually exist. One need look no further than a recent National Review article extolling Representative Jeff Flake’s (R – Ariz.) “Wastebook,” an annual publication that compiles examples of wasteful government spending. This year’s edition included several examples of research funded by NIH or NSF grants, and charges “the nation’s most prestigious science agencies” with “squandering resources … by investigating matters most would consider obvious or even absurd.”
Almost everyone, including Flake, agrees that we should fund beneficial translational initiatives like curing cancer. But Flake’s analysis betrays a lack of understanding of the scientific process. By definition, basic research doesn’t have immediately clear applications, and may seem absurd to some. Nevertheless, it isn’t politicians’ job to determine the merit of research proposals.
Rather than reducing “science” to flashy political issues, the press must educate the public on how science really works—by using basic, curiosity-driven research to arrive at fundamental discoveries, and then translating these basic principles into treatments and preventative measures against disease. In addition, the press must demonstrate how federal funding is integral to that mission. With lawmakers who don’t realize the value of basic science, we need journalists and citizens who do.
A Word of Caution: Politicizing Science
While it is imperative that the public rally around public funding of research, this must be done without making science funding a political issue. The skewed portrayal of science in the media is dangerous because it inherently politicizes science, repeatedly tying it to issues split down party lines. Appropriating the entire concept of “science” to refer to a list of highly controversial political issues is effective in rallying party partisans around certain causes, but falsely implies that science is—or should be—a solely Democratic or Republican issue.
As Mischa Fisher wrote in the Atlantic, “Science’s political constituency is too small and the coalition supporting it is not powerful enough to protect research budgets against other priorities … If it is perceived as a partisan litmus test, it will not continue to exist in its current state as the government’s other financial obligations continue to grow.” This is not to say that issues like climate change are exclusively political issues, or that denial of climate change is somehow legitimate political dissent rather than scientific illiteracy. It is important to remember remember, as Fisher reminds us, that although the right may be home to global warming skeptics, the left has its fair share of anti-GMO hardliners.
Climate change is the perfect example of how a cut-and-dry scientific issue can become controversial if it is represented consistently in partisan terms. Let’s not drag funding into the fray as well. Those who believe that science is a positive force in our society today should be highly motivated to ensure the federal government continues to support and nurture this essential enterprise. Federal funding of research is a crucial issue that needs bipartisan support, and it should be represented that way in the media.",Harvard Political Review,0
BREAKING: Witness to Major Hillary Crime Just Agreed to Testify,"admin News, Politics, U.SLeave a comment
The web of lies Hillary Clinton wove so carefully is finally unraveling. Thanks to the focus President Trump has put on the Clintons’ wrongdoings, the Senate is investigating the criminal relationship between Clinton and the anti-American firm, Fusion GPS.
This is the company that put out the fake Trump dossier. They also have ties to the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Jr. Now, the head of Fusion GPS has agreed to testifybefore the Senate Judiciary Committee. Their crimes will be exposed!
This absurd Russia investigation has gone on long enough. The American people are sick of the side show because we know that Trump has not colluded with the Russian government on anything. However, the investigation into Trump has served to highlight the real criminal acts of the Clintons!
It all comes back to Fusion GPS. The Washington, DC-based “opposition research” firm has been on the Democrat payroll for years. Remember the debunked dossier? It alleged that Trump was surrounded by prostitutes as he urinated on a bed Obama had slept in at a Russian hotel.
That ridiculous story destroyed the credibility of the website BuzzFeed and was the product of Fusion GPS. The project was originally paid for by anti-Trump RINOs and later taken over by the DNC.
Interestingly, the “source” of the dossier was former MI6 agent Christopher Steele–yet Democrats are never accused of “British collusion.” Isn’t it funny how those Leftist double standards work?
Fusion GPS is one of the most corrupt organizations in politics, and one doing the Democrat Party’s bidding. It’s a HUGE step in the right direction for the Senate Judiciary Committee to call their head, Glenn Simpson, to testify.
Simpson originally rejected a Senate request to provide information voluntarily and stated he would invoke the Fifth Amendment at a public hearing. In response, the Senate issued a subpoena obligating him to appear and talk.
Simpson ultimately reached a deal with the Senate to voluntarily speak at a hearing in exchange for having the subpoena withdrawn. The Senate should do their job and squeeze a confession of wrongdoing from him. There’s hope they’ll be tough; the chairman of the Judiciary Committee is Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), who has been a major critic of Fusion GPS.
The opposition research firm has come under renewed scrutiny following the much-talked about meeting between Donald Jr. and a Russian lawyer who claimed to have dirt on Hillary Clinton. The lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, has professional ties to Fusion GPS. As Attorney General, Loretta Lynch used this professional connection to allow Veselnitskaya into the US without a visa.
All signs point to a setup–a plot between Clinton, Veselnitskaya, and Fusion GPS to frame the Trump team. Even back then, they had this Russian collusion narrative in the works to delegitimize Trump.
The charade is over. The tables are turned. We’re getting to the bottom of this detestable plot to hurt our President. Hillary Clinton and her cohorts in Washington are going down. It’s high-time to put her behind bars! Lock her up!",Nevo News,1

Wikileaks has exposed that a “private, off the record” meeting was set up with the Clinton campaign and “Chinese ambassador Cui.”
So while Don Jr. met with a Russian lawyer that was NOT working for the Russian government at the time, Hillary met with a Chinese ambassador who WAS.

Ohio Rally! What Trump Just Said Minutes Ago Destroyed Obamacare Once And For All! (VIDEO),"POLITICS US CONSERVATIVE NEWS
 
July 25, 2017Alex D.2 Views 0 Comments# Donald Trump, # OHIO, Obamacare, Ohio Rally
President Trump went nuclear today in Ohio he honored the veterans and gave them so many good news but one news in particularly made the whole crowd go wild!
We all know that we the common people don’t want the Obamacare and we want it gone but the Democrats and some backstabbing Republicans were trying to keep the worst healthcare plan in our history alive!
Today in Ohio President Trump said:
We’re now one step closer to liberating our citizens from this Obamacare nightmare and delivering great health care for the American people,” he said before an enthusiastic crowd.
“I’m back in the American heartland far away from the Washington swamp,” he said.
But the greatest moment of the rally was when he unofficially announced the end of Obamacare!
President Trump praised the Senate on Tuesday for moving forward to debate the bill to repeal and replace the “Obamacare nightmare.”
“I applaud the Senate for taking a giant step to end the Obamacare nightmare. As this vote shows, inaction is not an option, and now the legislative process can move forward as intended to produce a bill that lowers costs and increases options for all Americans,” Trump said in a statement. “The Senate must now pass a bill and get it to my desk so we can finally end the Obamacare disaster once and for all.”
The video footage of the moment is below:
Earlier Tuesday the president called the Senate’s decision to move ahead on Obamacare repeal a “big step” for the country, adding, “Now we move forward towards truly great health care for the American people.”
So it looks like it’s happening, folks!
Ignore the lying mainstream media, the Obamacare is dead and our President just confirmed that!

"In what may be the ‘best political ad ever,’ Virginia candidate for governor vows to legalize fireworks","July 3, 2017 | Tom Tillison | Print Article
Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie knows how to appeal to Virginians; let them blow things up.
Gillespie released a campaign ad leading up to the Fourth of July promising to make fireworks legal if he is elected to office.
In the spot, the candidate is holding a sparkler while noting that fireworks permitted in Virginia are “rinky-dink,” compared to what neighboring states allow.
Gillespie posted the ad on Twitter, with the caption: “As Va. governor, I will work to make fireworks legal here so we can celebrate 4th of July in true American fashion!”

OK I’m gonna admit I’m not sure who won this one. The problem with Russian collusion stories is that the Russian government has dipped it’s formerly commie finger into every industry. So it’s hard to do ANY business in Russia without the government being involved somehow. That doesn’t mean you’re actually colluding. That allows for people to get away with some dubious reporting.
On the other hand, it’s way too convenient for Podesta to just shout “fake news” and ignore the accusations. I’m gonna say that without more solid evidence, this is still up in the air… but it was a good debate and interview nonetheless. Except when Bartiromo shows her rabid Trumper bias.",The Right Scoop,1
"Obama BUSTED ‘Acting As President’ In Indonesia, Trump Gives Him MAJOR Surprise","admin News, Politics, U.SLeave a comment
You would think that if you were a former president, you would want to respect the person coming into office after you. You would KNOW the job is challenging, and that the new president needs space. Apparently, Obama couldn’t care less about his successor.
In some weird reality, Obama still thinks of himself as the president and is making visits to countries like South Korea to talk to elected officials. Obama has been acting like this since he left office, and now it is finally coming back to bite him in the butt. Once Obama gets back to the United States, he is going to have to testify before Congress about the allegations that he knew well in advance about the wiretapping on Trump AND the rumors of Russian interference (via YouTube).
Originally, Obama stated he was going on a “family vacation,” but it seemed to have turned into something much different. It is almost as if Obama is pretending to be the president. The former president’s behavior is odd, disrespectful, and also violates the Logan Act.
The Logan Act is a federal law that carries a punishment including prison time. The law says that no unauthorized citizen can negotiate with foreign governments. According to what we can see here with Obama and the South Korean President that is very likely what he was doing.
Korea Herald reports that Moon spoke with Obama for about 40 minutes this week. During their meeting, Moon told Obama about his meetings with President Trump. Moon went as far as to ask Obama how he could improve his relationship with the current president. On what planet is this acceptable behavior?
Well, good ole’ Barry is going to be in for a surprise when he makes it back to the states. Newt Gingrich revealed on FOX & Friends, “Guess what’s about to happen: The Congress is about to have to call Barack Obama in to testify under oath about when he knew about Russia meddling.”
Things are going to start falling apart for Obama in a hurry. People are going to get exposed for their deception. Obama was involved in this scandal, and should not be able just to walk away.
Every Patriot in this country knows that Obama has one goal in mind: to dismantle Trump. The former president went against every standard in the world and made himself look like a fool.
Now he is going to have to face the music when he is done playing “shadow president.” What makes Obama think he has the right to deceive the entire country, then act like he is still relevant to the world when he is just another washed up liberal.
Personally, we cannot wait to hear what the former President has to say about the Russian meddling. He KNOWS something that we don’t, and if he lies under oath, it will catch up to him in one way or another. Better yet, if he decides to lie, he is going to be looking at obstruction of justice charges!
It is about time we start holding these people accountable. The behavior from the Left is unacceptable. PERIOD.",Nevo News,1

July 26, 2017 9:00 AM
Nearly a million undocumented drivers could be licensed in California by the end of the year.
Through June 2017, the Department of Motor Vehicles has issued approximately 905,000 driver’s licenses under Assembly Bill 60, the law requiring applicants to prove only their identity and California residency, rather than their legal presence in the state.
Passed in 2013, after more than 15 years of lobbying by advocates, AB 60 was intended to bolster public safety and reduce penalties for undocumented immigrants who drive. When it finally took effect at the beginning of 2015, making California the 10th state to offer driver’s licenses to immigrants living in the country illegally, the response was so immense that it doubled initial expectations.
That pace has since slowed considerably. The DMV issued about 11,000 AB 60 licenses last month, the lowest number since the program launched. There have been approximately 83,000 issued in the first half of 2017, only slightly more than March 2015, when the monthly total peaked with 76,000.
A study released by Stanford University researchers in April credited the law with reducing hit-and-run accidents statewide by at least 7 percent in its first year of implementation. Supporters have suggested it may also be a responsible for a surge in organ donors.

A leading Senate Democrat on Wednesday questioned the independence of a Federal Communications Commission nominee who worked as a top aide to the current chairman.
If confirmed, Brendan Carr, a Republican nominated last month by President Trump, would be the commission’s swing vote on Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal to dismantle tough net neutrality rules for online traffic.
Carr hasn’t publicly stated his position on the matter, but the assumption is he would support Pai, a fellow Republican and his former boss.
Members of the Senate Commerce Committee did not ask Carr for his position on net neutrality during a confirmation hearing Wednesday.
But Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), the committee’s top Democrat, pressed him to name an example of an issue on which he “substantively disagreed” with Pai.
Carr, an attorney who served as a legal advisor to Pai from 2014 to 2017, promised to be independent but said he did not want to discuss advice he gave to Pai.
“I’ll make my own decisions. I’ll call it the way I see it based on the facts, the record and what I think serves the public interest independent of where other people come out,” Carr told Nelson.
“I think my record over the years shows that I’m not a shrinking violet and am confident standing on my own feet and making my own decisions,” said Carr, who became the FCC’s general counsel in January.
Nelson asked the question several times and was not happy with Carr’s answer.
“Mr. Carr, that is not confidence-building for those of us who are wondering about your future independence from the boss that you have so ably served in the last number of years,” Nelson told him.
With a Republican Senate majority, Carr should have no trouble being confirmed. No Republicans at the hearing raised any concerns about Carr.
He was joined at the confirmation hearing by Pai, who has been nominated for a second five-year term, and Jessica Rosenworcel, who was nominated to fill a Democratic vacancy on the five-person commission.
Rosenworcel served as a commissioner from May 2012 until January, when her term expired after Senate Republicans would not bring her renomination up for a vote.
If all are confirmed as expected, the FCC would have a 3-2 Republican majority and be poised to roll back the net neutrality rules put in place in 2015 when the commission was controlled by Democrats. Rosenworcel voted for those rules. Pai opposed them.
The rules prohibit broadband providers from slowing Internet speeds for video streams and other content, selling faster lanes for delivering data or otherwise discriminating against any legal online material.
To enforce the rules, the FCC took the controversial step of classifying broadband as a more highly regulated utility-like service under Title 2 of federal telecommunications law. Broadband providers strongly opposed the move.
Pai has proposed repealing the Title 2 designation and wants to return to what he called “the light-touch regulatory framework” that allowed the Internet to flourish. The FCC voted 2-1 along party lines in May to start a formal rulemaking process on Pai’s proposal.
The White House said Tuesday it backed Pai’s move but wants Congress to pass net neutrality legislation to keep the rules from changing each time the FCC’s majority switches.
“We support the FCC chair's efforts to review and consider rolling back these rules, and believe that the best way to get fair rules for everyone is for Congress to take action and create regulatory and economic certainty,” said White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) has pushed for legislation that would enshrine the FCC’s rules without using the Title 2 oversight that opens the door to rate regulation and other stricter oversight in the future.
Net neutrality supporters staged a day of action last week, urging the public to tell the FCC not to change the rules.
More than 10 million online comments have been filed at the FCC during a 90-day period that ended on Monday, the most the agency has ever received about an issue. The public has until Aug. 16 to file replies to those comments.
Thune said Wednesday he was concerned about reports that thousands of pro-net neutrality comments are suspicious, including 300,000 from the same address in Russia.
“How do you weigh these kinds of suspicious comments with those comments that are more substantive and based on sound policy arguments?” Thune asked Pai.
Pai said the FCC wanted to set up an open process to allow the public to comment but understands that “there have been concerns on all sides about the veracity of some of these comments.”
The agency will weigh the comments and make a judgment “based on those facts that are in the record,” Pai said.

Mark Levin does not sound very happy about the Senate Republican bill. He says it’s basically the beginning steps towards single-payer European-style health care.

He rips some, not all, conservative media for turning into “pom pom boys and girls, and rockettes” for the bill. Dang!!

“There’s no serious talk about market solutions!” he says, and he’s pretty right.
So we’re basically enshrining Obamacare, just lightening the socialism a tiny bit, and putting the stamp of Republicanism on it. Levine’s right – it’s just progress in name only, and progressivism in substance. He even nails Trump on pretending to roll back Obama’s amnesty when all he did was undo DAPA, which was never implemented and stuck in the courts, and allowing DACA to continue.
Yeah, we’re basically screwed here folks. But I don’t see how anyone thinks Trump is going to save us, when he was the one candidate originally for single payer. Ah well…

Summer wildfires are once again blazing across southern Europe, forcing the evacuation of 12,000 people on France’s Mediterranean cost and devouring swaths of forests as far afield as Corsica, Portugal, Italy and Albania.
Authorities in the Côte d’Azur region decided to move people out of tents, campsites and holiday homes around the hilltop town of Bormes-les-Mimosas after a fire broke out in the surrounding forests on Tuesday.
Some of the 12,000 people displaced by the flames sheltered in gymnasiums, village halls and schools while others huddled on local beaches.

Karine Dolczewski, a mother of four from Pas-de-Calais who was on holiday with her family in the area, said they had been ordered to leave their holiday centre at about 10.30pm on Tuesday.
“The sky was all red,” she told Le Monde. “It was a huge blaze with enormous flames spreading everywhere.”
After hearing gas canisters exploding at a nearby campsite, guests at the centre in La Manne were told they needed to evacuate.
“We left everything there except for the baby’s bottle and nappies,” Dolczewski added. After marching calmly in single file down to the beach, they were taken to the village hall in Bormes-les-Mimosas.

Local journalists photographed several people curled up in sleeping bags on the sand while smoke from the fire could be seen in the distance.
On Tuesday, more than 4,000 firefighters and troops backed by 19 water-bombers had already been mobilised to extinguish the flames.
At least 12 firefighters have been injured and 15 police officers affected by smoke inhalation since the fires broke out on Monday, according to the authorities.
With strong winds and dry brush creating a dangerous mix, the government asked its European partners to send two extra firefighting planes – a request immediately fulfilled by Italy, according to the EU.
But one union official denounced what he said was a lack of spare parts that was preventing all the aircraft from being put into action.
Gerard Collomb, the interior minister, said France would be adding six more firefighting planes to its fleet. He made the announcement on Tuesday during a visit to the French Mediterranean island of Corsica, which also been badly affected by fires.

The number of people on France’s Côte d’Azur swells in July and August as holidaymakers head to the beach, and the area is experiencing an exceptionally hot, dry summer that has made it especially vulnerable to fires.
On Wednesday, Eric Martin of the Var firefighting unit told the BFM-TV channel that nearly 600 firefighters were trying to contain flames that had run through 1,300 hectares (3,210 acres).
Four tracker planes and a firefighting aircraft were sent in as thick black smoke billowed above the skyline.
The airport in Toulon, a city 25 miles (40km) from Bormes-les-Mimosas, was briefly closed on Wednesday, as well the Fort de Brégançon, which sits on a rock off the coast of Bormes.
The wildfires began raging along France’s Mediterranean coast two days ago, forcing smaller, scattered evacuations, with flames reaching a corner of Saint-Tropez.
A fire in nearby La Croix-Valmer was under control by Tuesday evening, according to the local fire chief, Philippe Gambe de Vergnes.
The blaze had already consumed 400 hectares of coastal forest in an area dotted with homes, he said. More than 200 people had to be moved from the area.
La Croix-Valmer’s deputy mayor, René Carandante, described a desolate landscape of blackened headlands fringed by charred umbrella pines, where green forest had once framed the azure waters of the Mediterranean. “It’s a disaster area. There’s nothing left,” he said.
François Fouchier, of the local coastal conservation group, said local wildlife, such as the Hermann’s tortoises, would be victims of the fires. “We are going to find burnt shells,” he said.
About 50 miles (80km) inland, 300 hectares of pines and oaks went up in smoke near the village of Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume. A local official accused the authorities of failing to regularly remove dry undergrowth, making the forest a fire hazard.
Further south, flames ate through 2,000 hectares (4,950 acres) of forest on the northern end of Corsica.
In Portugal, more than 2,000 firefighters were battling nine major wildfires on Wednesday, with drought conditions, high temperatures and strong winds fuelling the flames.
Another 1,000 firefighters were conducting mopping-up operations at 37 different Portuguese woodland blazes.
Ash floated in the air and vast plumes of smoke covered areas of central Portugal, in the area around Serta, about 125 miles (200km) north-east of Lisbon. The Civil Protection Agency said 24 water-dropping aircraft were in action.
Serta is close to Pedrógão Grande, where 64 people died in a wildfire last month. No injuries have been reported in recent days as the blazes raced through thick eucalyptus and pine forests.
Large wildfires are a common occurrence in summer in Portugal, where thousands of firefighters are on duty in the hottest months.
In Italy, where fires have raged for weeks, firefighters responded to 26 requests for water and fire retardant air drops on Tuesday, throughout central and southern Italy, including Calabria, Sicily, Sardinia, Lazio and Puglia.
The Coldiretti agriculture lobby said 50 billion bees were destroyed along with their hives in fires on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius. Coldiretti said another 20% of the bee population is estimated to have become disoriented and died as a result.
Albania’s interior ministry said 130 firefighters were battling 18 fire spots around the country on Wednesday.
A spokesman, Ardian Bita, said fires were blazing in five western and central districts, damaging 15 hectares (37 acres) of pastures, vineyards and dozens of olive trees.
Firefighters, military personnel and local authorities have been fighting about a dozen wildfires every day in Albania since the end of June. No injuries have yet been reported. Authorities have arrested several people accused of starting fires.
“Compared to a year ago we have increased public awareness and have also had better communication with the communities and local authorities,” said Bita.",The Guardian – World,0
"Trump Holds Nothing Back Against Mexican President, Drops Bombshell Right In His Lap About The Wall","At the G20 Summit in Germany, President Donald Trump met with Mexican President Enrique Nieto. The two leaders have been at odds when it comes to the border wall and who will be responsible for footing the bill.

ISIS terrorist blows himself up; it backfires on his own leaders,"An ISIS member took “fragging” to a whole new level when he decided to carry out a suicide mission against the Islamic State’s leadership.
According to the Iran Front Page:
[O]n Sunday (June 25), an ISIS suicide attacker, wearing an explosive belt, detonated himself among a number of the terrorist groups’ leaders who had convened in the Iraqi town of al-Qa’im, located 350 kilometres west of Ramadi, near the Syrian border.
With a fifth GOP senator rejecting the bill, is the healthcare vote DOA?The mind-boggling reason Obama is under fire from the LEFT!Shady firm behind Trump dossier stonewalling investigators after big payday
Some of the ISIS elements and leaders were either killed or injured in the explosion, a security official of al-Anbar Province in western Iraq, told the Iraqi TV channel Alsumaria News.
He added the self-detonation was a consequence of the numerous defeats the ISIS has suffered in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, while operations will also be launched soon to liberate the western regions of al-Anbar Province from the terrorist group.
Since three years ago, Iraqi towns of al-Qa’im, Rawa and Anah have been under the ISIS control. This comes as Iraqi forces are preparing to recapture these cities.
Given we know nothing about the identity of the man responsible, we don’t know if he was a jihadist who had become disillusioned with ISIS, or someone forced to fight for the group who had no other way out. Another possibility is since fighters rarely surrender, the only option for fighters tapped is suicide. The fatalities of his fellow jihadists could’ve been accidental.
Regardless of the context, ISIS certainly seems to be resigning in Mosul. Last week they blew up the Grand al-Nura Mosque of Mosul, the mosque from which ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi made his only public appearance, and declared a caliphate.
Only a few hundred ISIS fighters are believed to be left in Mosul, a city that was once a major stronghold for the terror group.
As the stench of death fills the streets of Mosul (literally) from the bodies of killed ISIS fighters, surely there must be a shortage of virgins in paradise by now.

My use of social media is not Presidential – it’s MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL. Make America Great Again!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 1, 2017
That’s right, instead of owning how absolutely immature and childish his tweets are, and instead of apologizing to everyone he’s every defamed on Twitter, he decided to double down and declare he’s a “modern day” president. However, unless “modern day” is synonymous with “petulant child,” then no, he’s just a petulant child and is anything but presidential.
Trump’s tweets aren’t only often absolute lies and propaganda, but they’re also often extremely dangerous because it tells leaders around the world that Trump is easily triggered. That he’s not level-headed. For our allies, this must be terrifying. For our enemies, Trump exposing his weaknesses like this is insight into how he’ll behave with foreign policy. All in all, Trump tweeting like he does, besides being childish, is bad the whole way around. It absolutely isn’t “modern day presidential” — there’s no such thing — you’re either presidential or you’re not, and he’s not.

Lawmakers Need a Russia Sanctions Strategy with an Exit Plan,"History shows that the lack of flexibility or graduation mechanisms in congressional sanctions can create unnecessary complications for the United States.
The Russia-sanctions train appears to be accelerating out of the congressional station, which makes it highly unlikely that both chambers of the Legislative Branch will want to revisit its provisions, especially when escape from Washington’s heat beckons with the forthcoming summer recess. Nevertheless, it behooves members of Congress, if they are determined to continue with this course of action (and the absolute majorities voting in favor of different versions of the sanctions in both the House of Representatives and Senate, far above the number needed to override any possible presidential veto), to take a pause and consider some changes.
Our European allies, when they first imposed their wide-ranging sanctions on Russia for its actions in Ukraine, built in a critical safeguard into the process: the semi-annual review process. Because EU sanctions must be renewed every six months, the Europeans have the opportunity to assess whether any progress has occurred. Also, they have the opportunity to adjust those sanctions either to address further infractions or to encourage positive developments. There is a greater flexibility in the European process that the present codification of U.S. sanctions lacks. Currently, there is neither a specified span of time after which sanctions can be revisited nor is there clear criteria that specifies when Russia might be judged to be in compliance with the provisions of those sanctions. Additionally, there is no mechanism for rapid or effective graduation should positive outcomes be achieved.
Many experts have concluded, in retrospect, that the U.S. grain embargo against the Soviet Union after its invasion of Afghanistan would have been most effective if it had been promulgated for a one-year period. That would have sent a clear signal of U.S. disapproval and it would have avoided putting the United States in a corner. Over time, the Soviets found ways around the initial ban that did not compromise their policy in Afghanistan and, ultimately, the embargo sputtered out as domestic commercial pressure from U.S. farmers to restart sales won out over geopolitical aspirations. Experts assisting the House of Representatives in reframing the initial sanctions proposal also removed some of the provisions that would have been most likely to create problems with key U.S. allies and undermine trans-Atlantic cohesion on the existing sanctions regime.
Given the depth of anger in the U.S. Congress over Russian actions in Syria, Ukraine and over the 2016 elections, some legislative response was inevitable. But imposing the major sanctions contained in both legislative drafts, along with a time limit that caps off at 2018—after the Russian presidential elections are held and after the conclusion of the U.S. midterm elections—would be wise. That way, Congress could then review and assess whether progress has been made in Syria and Ukraine, which might be a more effective wielding of U.S. geoeconomic tools. Beyond that, members of Congress, who have made it clear that they do not trust the current occupant of the Oval Office to determine when Russia has met the criteria for having sanctions lifted, may also want to consider whether they want to deny that prerogative to future occupants of the White House. Sooner or later, there will be a new U.S. president and, if only for reasons of biological realism, there will be a new president sitting in the Kremlin. There would be no ability, under the current legislation, for a future U.S. president to be able to rapidly take advantage of changed conditions in Moscow. History shows that the lack of flexibility or graduation mechanisms in congressional sanctions can create unnecessary complications for the United States. For example, it took the country two decades to graduate Russia, even after it proved that it had been in full compliance with the provisions of the Jackson-Vanik sanctions. Again, our European colleagues, especially French president Emmanuel Macron, who also faced what appeared to be Russian efforts to derail his election, still recognize the need for flexibility in how and when sanctions are applied on Russia—and they want to be able to adapt to the possibility of conditions that have changed.
In the past, Congress applied sunset clauses to sanctions it had passed against countries like Iran. Those clauses required the legislative branch to undertake periodic reviews to determine if renewal was warranted. Present sanctions against Russia do not have such provisions and thus carry the risk that they might not compel Moscow to moderate its behavior. Instead, Russia may conclude that it has no incentive to offer concessions since there appears to be little chance that it could meet the conditions that would prompt Congress to lift the sanctions.
Lawmakers believe that President Barack Obama did not sufficiently punish Moscow for its perceived transgressions in 2016 and that President Donald Trump has little incentive to do so, so they want to ensure that an American stick is clearly on display. But, as the former president observed, one always needs to have “offramps” should a situation change. Congress may not be in a mood to put provisions in the bill that is being prepared for the president’s signature—but they should consider some revisions, if not now, then down the line—so that the bill does not lock U.S. policy into a dead end.

People are Going Crazy Over This Recent American Ninja Warrior Contestant,"NBC’s “American Ninja Warrior” is known for combining inspirational stories with demonstrations of physical ability, and Monday night’s episode was no exception. One of the contestants specifically caught the attention of the audience based on the story of the challenges he faces in his life and the valiant way he took on the obstacle course.
As reported by A Plus, Jimmy Choi suffers from Parkinson’s disease, a chronic movement disorder estimated to affect up to 1 million Americans.
The 41-year-old tech consultant from Illinois was diagnosed with a young-onset form of the disease at age 27. Only four percent of Parkinson’s suffers are typically diagnosed before the age of 50.
Choi described how his initial diagnosis left him feeling “a lot of anger and depression,” but that turned around and, in 2012, he discovered how exercise could help him manage his condition.
He previously competed in bike rides, marathons, and triathlon. Throughout his competitions, he has raised over $100,000 for the Michael J. Fox Foundation.
Speaking of the American Ninja Warrior course, Choi said, “My goal is to go out there and show everybody out there, no matter what they’re faced with, the hardest step is the first step,” continuing, “Once you take that first step, the rest comes easy.”
Michael J. Fox, himself diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease at age 29, sent a message to Choi saying, “Life is an obstacle course, and Parkinson’s adds its own hurdles along the way, but you handle it all with grace and determination.”
Others took to Twitter to express their support for Choi including one of the show’s hosts, Akbar Gbajabiamila.
Choi’s run on the “American Ninja Warrior” course started strong, but he ultimately fell on the broken pipes obstacle, disqualifying him from going further in this year’s competition.
However, Choi is already looking ahead and is hoping to take on the course next year.",The Tribunist,1
The Republicans Have Three Health Care Bills And No Clear Paths Forward,"It has been a very confusing week in federal health care policy. Early in the week, the Senate abruptly abandoned an effort to pass a bill to repeal and replace parts of the Affordable Care Act after four senators said they wouldn’t support it. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell then said he would push to pass a bill that would repeal parts of the law in two years, buying the Senate more time to come up with a replacement. Three senators quickly said they wouldn’t support that approach, and the Senate all but gave up. That lasted until President Trump called various senators to the White House, pressuring them to keep working until they agreed on a bill, just a day after he suggested letting Obamacare fail.
Like I said, it’s been a confusing week.
There are some obvious reasons that the GOP is having a hard time coalescing around a plan. Part of the problem is that Republicans don’t agree on the priorities for repeal. The conservative wing of the party wants to peel back regulations and reduce federal spending. Moderates are concerned about changes to Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program for the poor, and reduced support for low-income people who are buying private insurance. Two have also said they don’t support defunding Planned Parenthood for a year, as would happen under each of the bills.
Then there’s the challenge of the GOP bills’ lack of support from the public.
You’d be forgiven for not knowing where things stand on the seven-year Republican promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. There are at least three bills floating around, each with opponents within the Republican Party and varying levels of detail about what the effect of each plan would be on the health insurance landscape.
So here’s a roundup of current proposals, what we know about their impact and who supports them:
The Senate’s Better Care Reconciliation Act
What’s in the bill: This legislation — a new version of the measure that has been debated since the first draft was released on June 22 — would reduce subsidies for people who buy insurance on the marketplaces set up by Obamacare. Some of the Obamacare taxes would be repealed (though two taxes on the wealthy would remain in place). It would allow states to opt out of many of the insurance market regulations, including mandatory coverage of “essential health benefits,” which include maternity care and mental health treatment.
The legislation would also freeze the Obamacare expansion of Medicaid. The expansion opened up the program to all people earning under 138 percent of the federal poverty limit in states that opted in.1 Starting in 2020, the expanded part of the program would take no new enrollees, and states would be reimbursed significantly less for those who continue to be covered (under current law, the federal government would pick up 90 percent of the cost of those enrollees). The bill would also put most of the rest of the Medicaid program on a budget. States would receive a maximum fixed amount per enrollee, or a lump sum for the whole state program, rather than the open-ended reimbursements they get today.
Altogether, the bill would decrease costs for higher-income, healthier people without employer-sponsored insurance and would increases costs for lower-income, sicker people.
What we know about its effects: The bill was posted Thursday, and a Congressional Budget Office analysis of it released the same day found that 15 million fewer people would have insurance coverage next year and 22 million fewer would be covered in 2026, compared with how many would be covered under current law. Premiums would increase over the next two years even as the plans those premiums pay for cover less, according to the CBO, but would decrease starting in 2020. This plan would reduce the federal deficit by $420 billion over a decade, according to CBO estimates.
Who supports it: It’s not yet clear how senators feel about it, although there are clues from previous, similar iterations of the bill. It’s unlikely to please conservative Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who have said that previous iterations of the Senate bill, similar in many ways to this version,2 didn’t do enough to cut regulations. Several moderate Republicans have also expressed concern about the proposed changes to Medicaid funding.
The Senate’s Better Care Reconciliation Act, with an amendment from Ted Cruz
What’s in the bill: This version of the bill is largely similar to the one above, but it includes a complicated amendment adopted from a proposal by Cruz. The change would allow insurers who sell regulated, Obamacare-compliant plans to also sell largely unregulated plans. Insurers would be required to offer coverage to people with pre-existing conditions and cover essential health benefits for the Obamacare-compliant plans, and they wouldn’t be allowed to charge based on how sick a person is. Insurers selling these plans, however, could likely also sell plans that cover far fewer services and could deny people coverage based on their health status or charge them more for these plans.
What we know about its effects: The amendment is so complicated that HuffPost reported that it could be a month before it can be fully analyzed by the CBO. The Senate needs a score of the bill before it can proceed with a vote, so it asked the Department of Health and Human Services for an analysis; HHS hired the consulting firm McKinsey to produce a report, which the Washington Examiner obtained Wednesday. The report purportedly shows that premiums would drop under the Cruz plan, but experts say it offers little in the way of useful information, as Sarah Kliff explained at Vox. For starters, it looks at how the amendment would work if added to existing law, not the Republican bill.
Experts believe it would gut protections for people with pre-existing conditions by pricing them out of the market. The insurance industry has come out hard against the Cruz plan. In a memo circulated publicly, America’s Health Insurance Plans, one of the insurance industry’s largest trade associations, condemned the amendment, while Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, a lobbying group representing the insurer, told Senate leaders the proposal was “unworkable.” Health policy experts warn that if the Cruz amendment becomes law, healthy people will buy on the unregulated, cheaper market, leaving people with more health care needs on the Obamacare markets.
Who supports it: Four senators have previously said they would not vote to move forward with debating this bill: Lee, Paul, Susan Collins of Maine and Jerry Moran of Kansas. Only 14 senators have expressed clear support, according to The New York Times.
Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act, aka repeal and delay
What’s in the bill: This bill would repeal much of the ACA starting in 2020, though some changes would take effect immediately.
The bill would repeal the ACA’s expansion of Medicaid, as well as the subsidies that help people buy insurance on the private marketplace. It would repeal all of the taxes created by the ACA and eliminate a fund created for public health work after 2018. It includes numerous other changes as well, such as eliminating requirements on what services state Medicaid programs must cover. The repeal bill would, however, add $1.5 billion over two years to respond to the opioid crisis and funding for community mental health centers.
It would also retroactively (to 2016) get rid of the requirement that employers offer coverage to employees and the requirement that most people have insurance — by eliminating the financial penalties for both.
What we know about its effects: The CBO (which has had a busy week) released an analysis of this bill on Wednesday. The agency thinks 32 million additional people would be uninsured in 2026 (compared with current law) and that the federal deficit would be reduced by $473 billion during that time. The estimated increase in the number of uninsured people includes 19 million who would fall from the Medicaid rolls. But millions would also be uninsured as a result of an upended insurance market, according to the analysis — the agency found that premiums would roughly double by 2026 and that about three-quarters of the population would live in places where no insurer would be willing to sell coverage in the private market.
Of course, this strategy is built around developing a replacement plan over the next two years. But it’s impossible to say what that would look like. Meanwhile, with the immediate repeal of the individual insurance mandate, some 17 million would be expected to lose coverage next year.
Who supports it: Notably, Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said after a meeting on Wednesday that he didn’t think there were even 40 senators who supported the strategy of repeal and then replace later. Several senators, including Collins, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, have already come out against the approach.",Five Thirty Eight,0
Wasserman Schultz: Jeh Johnson ‘wrong in every respect’ in testimony on DNC hack,"LIBERAL NONSENSE POLITICS VIDEOS
 
June 24, 2017June 24, 2017Alex D.34 Views 1 CommentWasserman Schultz
The Dems are self-imploding. I had faith that this would come. Their corrupt ways had to come to light eventually. I’m sure the best is yet to be revealed, but it is coming.
Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D., Fla.) said Thursday that Jeh Johnson’s congressional testimony on the Democratic National Committee’s computer hack is “wrong in every respect” and “utterly misinformed.”
“He’s wrong in every respect,” Schultz told CNN’s Kate Bolduan. “Let me be very clear. At no point during my tenure at the DNC was I contacted by the FBI, DHS, or any government agency, or alerted or made aware that they believed that the Russians, an enemy state, was intruding on our network.”
Wassermann Schultz excoriated them, saying that as a member of Congress, she could have been told if Russians were involved. She also claimed that they just called the desk and spoke to a low-level employee.
Then perhaps the most astonishing thing she said was to accuse the DHS and the FBI of leaving the Russians access to the server without telling the DNC about it.
So either she’s not telling the truth or they took this so seriously they did nothing for a year?
So how important did they think this was if they did nothing? It apparently didn’t become important until after Hillary Clinton lost and they needed an excuse to delegitimize Trump.
And it’s amazing that it’s Debbie Wasserman Schultz saying this if it’s true.
Call Debbie Wasserman Schultz and put her under oath
Well, either she is lying or Johnson is lying- which begs the question- if the Russians were such a threat- why didn’t Obama do something about it? Because he needed the Russian’s help on the Iranian deal which he was going to do no matter what and he didn’t expect Trump to win. It is only because Trump won that the Russian story became important.
It’s amazing to me that Vasserman, Clinton, Brazille are not already u dry investigation. The DNC should investigate them on their own. If I were an org saddled with those winners I would take a close self-inventory.",USA Supreme,1

Deepening controversy around the Trump campaign's Russian ties is barely registering in the early stages of competitive congressional races around the country.
But if there's one place where investigations into Moscow's support for Donald Trump might matter, it's in Republican Dana Rohrabacher's California district— the increasingly competitive Orange County seat held by a man who can't stop defending the Kremlin.
From Rohrabacher’s vocal defenses of Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting with a Kremlin-linked lawyer, to his own dealings with an ex-Soviet counterintelligence official who was at that same meeting, to a report that the FBI warned Rohrabacher Russian spies were trying to recruit him, his reputation as Vladimir Putin’s best friend in Congress is landing him in story after unflattering story about Moscow’s broader influence campaign.
And back home, people are beginning to notice.
“Our district really didn’t understand that, and that was just a low-key kind of non-issue,” said Diana Lee Carey, vice chair of the Democratic Party of Orange County’s west division, which includes Rohrabacher’s district. “People are now starting to be aware of it.”
Rohrabacher, who fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan, is a Cold Warrior-turned- Putin defender who also happens to be running in a district that Hillary Clinton won. (She was the first Democratic presidential candidate to win Orange County since 1936, defeating Trump by less than two percentage points.) Now, Rohrabacher is one of several Republicans national Democrats are targeting in California.
He has held the seat since 1988 and won by 17 percentage points in 2016 despite Clinton’s victory, and any incumbent with that kind of record has enormous built-in advantages.

But Democrats see an opportunity in 2018 built in part on Rohrabacher’s views about Moscow at a time when friendliness toward Russia is fraught—in a way that it hasn’t been in recent past cycles—amid investigations into Kremlin meddling in the 2016 campaign. While Rohrabacher has long been an advocate for better relations with Russia, Democrats think that position may be perceived in a new light.
“Dana Rohrabacher, his record, his deep connections to Russia, have never been put under a microscope,” said one national Democrat familiar with the race. “They will this cycle. That is a huge difference. He sits in a district Hillary Clinton won. He’s never had his record examined closely. That’s going to happen this cycle. I think people are going to be pretty shocked about what they find.”
To prosecute that case, national Democrats are enthusiastic about Hans Keirstead, a stem cell researcher and businessman who is one of several candidates challenging Rohrabacher. And some Republicans privately concede that Keirstead is a strong candidate.
“You’ve got to take the new contender pretty seriously. He’s got cash,” said a California Republican consultant familiar with the race. “It’s hard to be a good fit for the district when you’re a Democrat. Having said that, I do think his profile looks very strong, it gives him some real credibility in a race against someone whose credibility is sometimes questionable.”
Democrats stress that in Rohrabacher’s district, as in other competitive seats across the country, health care is the issue that most motivates their base—not complicated and still-evolving Russia investigations. But that hasn’t stopped the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Rohrabacher’s opponents from pouncing on controversial comments Rohrabacher makes about Moscow, and activists are taking note.
“His district voted for Hillary Clinton and then voted for Dana Rohrabacher. The reason, I believe, is because he’s a 20-year incumbent,” said Aaron McCall, the chairman of the progressive Indivisible chapter in the 48th district. Indivisible groups across the country have been mobilizing to protest Trump’s agenda. “Beyond that, they didn’t know much about him other than he’s a surfer and for marijuana legalization. But now people are learning about Dana Rohrabacher, learning about his stances on Russia, his support of Vladimir Putin.”
Democrats with knowledge of the race say that the messaging focus for the foreseeable future will be that instead of delivering for the district, Rohrabacher has been enmeshed in a series of controversial, even odd, dealings with Russian associates in a way that pushes him well out of the Republican mainstream. Keirstead leaned into that message in an interview with McClatchy.
“Rohrabacher is more interested in talking to spies and poorly affiliated lawyers than he is worrying about things in this district,” Keirstead said, adding, “You can’t get ahold of the guy, but he loves to be on TV and talk on the [House] floor about Russia.”
Rohrabacher wasn’t made available for an interview for this story, and his office declined to comment.
EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
Keirstead’s campaign is also regularly highlighting a story about Rohrabacher’s opposition to a bill designed to cripple Syria’s Russian-backed Assad regime, which is slaughtering Syrian civilians. During a hearing on Capitol Hill, Rohrabacher argued that the U.S. and its allies have also been guilty of killing innocents, and that pressuring Bashar al-Assad could lead to a takeover from a worse actor—a position entirely out of step with other Republicans on the committee, not to mention the Democrats. To Keirstead, that’s the point.
“I officially ran out of WTFs during that entire speech,” marveled Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., in a testy exchange with Rohrabacher captured in the story Keirstead’s campaign is circulating. “To put a moral equivalency of our action in Mosul to what Bashar al-Assad is doing made me honestly want to throw up. It was embarrassing.”

For all of the discomfort he causes even members of his own party, the power of incumbency will be meaningful for Rohrabacher, who back home has a distinct brand that many political observers say closely matches the district.
“Dana won by a massive amount last time,” said Jim Righeimer, a Republican city council member from Costa Mesa, Calif. “With all the money and activity and everything else, it won’t be the same spread, but this district couldn’t care less about anything to do with Russia…obviously, Dana’s going to have to do a bigger campaign, raise more money and all of that, but in the end I don’t see it changing anything at all.”
In the 48th district, which stretches from Seal Beach and Huntington Beach down past Laguna Beach, and east toward Irvine, there are plenty of wealthier, better-educated voters who might lean Republican but don’t like Trump, as well as growing minority communities that tilt Democratic. But there is also a more blue-collar slice of the 48th District that appreciates Rohrabacher’s hardline views on issues like immigration and isn’t put off by his embrace of Trump, observers of the district say, and there is another faction that appreciates his libertarian leanings and embrace of marijuana legalization.
“If you sit in Washington D.C., ‘oh, here’s this Rohrabacher guy, he gets mentioned by the Russians…he’s looked at by a lot of colleagues in Washington as a lightweight, he’s not known as someone who contributes financially to committees,’” said Jon Fleischman, the conservative publisher of the Flash Report, a well-regarded publication about California politics.
“But this guy is quintessentially his district. The surfing congressman, everybody knows it.”
EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE
Another challenge for Democrats is landing a candidate who can effectively litigate a case in a district that still chose Rohrabacher, even while voting against Trump. In Rohrabacher’s district, and across the country, the Democratic primary field is crowded with both moderates, such as businessman Harley Rouda, and progressives, such as architect and community activist Laura Oatman. Any candidate who could ultimately pose a credible challenge to lawmakers like Rohrabacher, who come from Republican-tilted districts, will first have to survive a primary with a base that is increasingly pushing for things like single-payer healthcare.
“In this polarizing environment, it’s going to be very difficult for somebody to run on the Democratic side and posture themselves as some sort of moderate, because the entire environment is going to force you to say…are you a Trump person or a [Nancy] Pelosi person?” Fleischman said. “The reality is, there’s no way that congressional seat elects a liberal Democrat. It just won’t. I think it’s a very challenging environment for someone to be a Democratic candidate and try to posture themselves as a centrist.”
Asked about Democratic primaries, DCCC communications director Meredith Kelly replied with an eye on retaking the House: “We reserve the right to get involved in primaries. Ultimately the job is to beat House Republicans and get to 218.”
And certainly, if Rohrabacher does find himself in a truly competitive race—which would be his first in years—he could end up more vulnerable than his winning record would suggest, some veteran political observers say.
""Once you get into a competitive situation, people are going to learn things they didn't know before,"" said Bill Carrick, a longtime California-based Democratic consultant. ""Obviously, the Russian thing is an unusual situation, and unusual in the sense that it parallels a lot of what we hear about the Trump administration. That may make the situation even more complicated.""

Muslim-Loving NY Mayor Skipped Funeral Of Cop – Here’s The SICK Place He Just Ended Up Instead,"This past week, New York Police Department officer Miosotis Familia, who was also a mother of three children was shot and killed in what the NYPD Commissioner James P. O’Neill has called an “unprovoked attack”. The suspect, Alexander Bonds was shot and killed by two other officers on the scene, but the damage was already done. As the city grieves this tragic murder, Mayor de Blasio has jetted off instead of attending the funeral, and where he ended up is sickening.
Mayor de Blasio is not exactly loved by the New York City police, and it is easy to see why considering the disturbing move he just made. The family of Miosotis Familia and the police gathered after the murder to honor her memory. One would think that Mayor de Blasio would join in to pay his respects to the fallen officer, but he was nowhere to be found.
Members of the New York City police department pay their resepcts.
On Thursday morning de Blasio packed his bags and left for Germany to join the “resistance” and protest the G20 meetings in Germany leaving the city and police officers in a state of shock. Instead of the media reporting on this disgusting act by the mayor, they are only focused on the non-story that’s Russia and President Trump’s overseas visit.
You just can’t make this stuff up folks.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has flown to Hamburg, Germany to protest the meeting of President Donald Trump with other world leaders at Friday’s G20 summit.
His decision to skip off comes one day after a police officer was murdered in the Bronx, and it also meant he missed a swearing in ceremony for 524 new NYPD recruits in order to catch his flight.

A statement from City Hall confirmed de Blasio “will attend several events surrounding the G20 Summit, including Saturday’s Hamburg Zeigt Haltung rally.”
The rally, which translates into “Hamburg Shows Attitude,” is in protest against a range of world leaders descending on the city, which includes Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Images from the first rally show around 12,000 people, many of whom are far-left militants, turning violent with police being forced to use water cannons and tear gas to control the crowd. One banner held up read: “G20 WELCOME TO HELL.”
The cost of de Blasio’s visit is being covered by the organizers of the rally, mayoral spokesman Eric Phillips said, who is also accompanying him on the trip.
The decision to fly to Hamburg will likely increase pressure on de Blasio, after a New York City Police officer was murdered Wednesday after being shot in the head while sat in her vehicle, in what authorities described as an “unprovoked attack.”
A report this week by the Department of Homeless Services also found that the homeless population in New York City increased by nearly 40 percent in 2017, rising from 2,794 in February 2016 to 3,892 in February 2017.

Yeah, this guy is a real class act, wouldn’t you say? However, this is exactly the reason why an overwhelming percentage of cops cannot stand Mayor de Blasio. In a poll that was conducted last year, 97 percent of cops said that de Blasio has created an environment where criminals feel emboldened, while 95 percent said he has established an environment that is combative to police.
That does not sound like a good move to make considering he is up for reelection soon, right?
Mayor de Blasio rather fly half way around the world and protest our president than actually being a leader to his city. So, the presumptive Republican challenger for mayor, Nicole Malliotakis decided to take this time to rip into this liberal idiot.
“Unbelievable. Instead of jet-setting around the world, he should be here doing his job,” said the Staten Island assemblywoman. “A police officer was murdered, street homelessness has skyrocketed and people continue to get delayed on the trains.”

Not only did Nicole Malliotakis have harsh criticism for de Blasio, but so did the head of the police union Ed Mullins. “As the city mourns, its leader flees,” Mullins was quoting as saying. “And then he wonders why he has a problem with the police. A real leader stays with the city in this time of hardship.”
And, the left wonders why they keep losing elections.
Mayor de Blasio is truly skating on thin ice and this controversial move he just made is not going to help him. Mayor de Blasio is not interested in keeping his city safe but will pander to everyone that can harm Americans and our culture. Just last year, de Blasio made the choice to close New York City schools for Mulsim holidays, fought President Trump’s travel ban, and put an end to all NYPD surveillance of mosques and Muslim terrorists.
Mayor de Blasio needs to be voted out and soon, but that will only happen if the people of New York wake up.

Man Sentenced for Plot to Kill Former President Obama,"Written by Keely Sharp
A Boston inmate who was being held at the Old Colony Correctional Center was sentenced on Thursday for threatening and plotting to kill former President Barack Obama.
Obama was the nail in my shoe, the thorn in my side, the splinter under my nail (you get the point) but I would never wish death upon the leader of my country. I may not agree with him in the slightest way, but hoping for the president to fall is like hoping for the failure of a pilot flying the plane we are all on.
Thirty-two year old Alex Hernandez has been sentenced to 37 months in prison by the U.S. District Court Judge Indira Talwani. Then he will be on a supervised release for the first three years of his release.
In May 2017, Hernandez pleaded guilty to one count of threatening to kill and inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States. Hernandez is currently serving a five-to-eight-year sentence at Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center following a 2011 state conviction for drug and firearms offenses, including the illegal possession of a .22 caliber handgun, a Tec-9, a .22 caliber rifle – all of which were equipped with high capacity magazines, and ammunition.
In March of 2015, it was discovered by federal agents that Hernandez had a strong desire to kill Obama. He had also apparently been looking into getting his hands on fake travel documents so that he could get our of the country after he carried out his attack.
TRENDING ON EAGLE RISING
Law enforcement officers then set up a meeting between Hernandez and an undercover agent who posed as an embassy contact with the ability to assist Hernandez with obtaining false travel documents.
On Dec. 22, 2015, and Feb. 12, 2016, the undercover agent met with Hernandez at Old Colony Correctional Center. During the first meeting, Hernandez stated that he wanted to attack the White House and that he was studying how to make explosives that could be placed around government buildings to “create chaos.” During the second meeting with the undercover agent, Hernandez, a Muslim convert, discussed the motivation for his planned attacks, telling the agent that his “brothers are fighting to uphold the laws and structure of the caliphate in the Middle East” and that “this government . . . is painting it like they are the bad guys[.]” Hernandez also explained that he wanted to target the President because “he’s the one that gives the orders[.]”
It seems like an extremely light sentence to me. Perhaps because Obama is no longer president, they do not feel like it needs to be longer?

Brazil top court ruling potentially undercuts Temer investigation,"Brazilian President Michel Temer attends a ceremony of the 152nd anniversary of the Riachuelo Naval Battle at the Marine Corps Headquarters in Brasilia, Brazil June 9, 2017.
BRASILIA Brazil's Supreme Court ruled on Thursday it has the right to reject plea bargains made in corruption probes, potentially undercutting investigations that have threatened President Michel Temer's government, prosecutors said. A majority of the court said plea bargains, such as those made by dozens of executives at the world's largest meatpacker JBS SA and construction firm Odebrecht [ODBES.UL], could be evaluated by the full court and rejected if they rule that a state's witness lied or withheld information. However, the court ruled that it did not have the right to change the benefits that prosecutors give a person who turns state's witness.
That move would have killed the entire plea bargain process, which has been a key tool in uncovering massive graft schemes in recent years, prosecutors told Reuters.
""The full court cannot change the terms of a plea bargain if all its terms were met,"" said Justice Luiz Fux. ""Once the plea bargain has been approved by prosecutors, the only thing that can be analyzed is if there was full collaboration.""
Three federal prosecutors directly involved in the biggest of the graft investigations told Reuters that their main fear was that the court might have ruled it could change the benefits given to state's witnesses. That, one prosecutor said, would have been ""a signal to those who may wish to strike an accord with prosecutors and turn over substantial amounts of proof of corruption that they may not really benefit from doing so."" While the court stopped short of that, investigators fear that involving all 11 top court justices in deciding whether or not a state's witness has fully collaborated could still spook some potential witnesses into not talking. Eloisa Machado, a law professor at the elite FGV university in Sao Paulo, said Thursday's ruling was still positive, however, since it signaled the continuation of Brazil's various corruption investigations.
That was especially true, according to Machado, of the ""Operation Car Wash"" probe that has uncovered billions of dollars in bribes paid by big firms like JBS and Odebrecht, money that was funneled to politicians and executives at state-run companies in return for lucrative contracts. The anti-graft push has put Temer, four past presidents, and dozens of lawmakers under investigation and led to the conviction of over 90 powerful politicians and businessmen.
""With the ruling, the Supreme Court guaranteed the integrity of Operation Car Wash and the chance that other mega cases of corruption and organized crime will be discovered,"" said Machado.
Brazil only began allowing plea-bargain agreements in 2013. Scores have been struck, notably that of 77 Odebrecht executives and seven businessmen from JBS.
It was testimony in the JBS case that earlier prompted the Supreme Court to authorize an investigation into allegations that Temer took millions of dollars in bribes to help the meatpacker.
The conservative leader, who replaced impeached President Dilma Rousseff just over a year ago, has denied any wrongdoing and accused a leading witness against him of lying.
Plea-bargain testimonies have shaken Brazil's political and business sectors to their core as they revealed the corrosive effects of graft on Latin America's biggest economy.
Joesley and Wesley Batista, the brothers who control JBS, managed to avoid serving any jail time as part of their plea-bargain deal, though they had to pay a total of 225 million reais ($67.4 mln) in fines. The Batistas and other JBS executives managed to stun a nation accustomed to the corruption revelations when they testified they had spent roughly 500 million reais in recent years to bribe nearly 1,900 politicians at all levels of government.

Entitled Malia Obama Just Got Her Own American Holiday And You Won’t Believe What It Is,"Just when you think that the Obama family couldn’t be less patriotic than they have been, they disgrace the most American of all holidays the fourth of July Independence day.
Not only is the 4th of July the date of the United States Independence, but this day shares a birthday of Malia Obama, the oldest daughter of Barrack Obama, the 44th President of the United States. The liberal left wing loonies of this country decided to take it upon themselves to ignore this American holiday, a day that our forefathers have fought and sacrificed their lives for a free nation, to instead celebrate the birthday of Malia Obama. We all know that this is their retaliation of the fact that their “anointed one” Hillary Clinton has lost. They have been nothing but vile towards President Trump since day one of his Presidency, so it’s no surprise they would take this opportunity to insult the United States since now we have a President who is a proud being American and the great history of this country.
Here are some of the comments which will make you sick and ashamed.
TRENDING ON FREEDOM DAILY
Several took to Twitter to celebrate the former First Daughter’s birthday. Chance the Rapper sent out a tweet that received more than 289,000 likes. Critics took the viral sensation as a sign of disrespect towards the United States. The 19-year-old spent her birthday with friends in Montauk, New York.
Americans celebrating ‘Malia Obama Day’ instead of Independence Day on July 4 have been accused of anti-Americanism.
Several people took to Twitter on Tuesday to say they were celebrating the former first daughter’s birthday instead of American independence.
The former First Daughter turned 19 as the United States turned 241 – and some took the opportunity to toast one birthday over the other.
But the move angered many commentators who said the country was being disrespected by the tweets.
One Twitter user wrote: ‘The 4th of July? I don’t know her. Happy Malia Obama Day.’
‘Happy 4th of July! On this day 19 years ago Malia Obama signed the Declaration of Independence,’ tweeted another.
Chance the Rapper, who is a family friend of the Obamas, even got in on the action with a tweet that garnered more than 289,000 likes and was retweeted more than 123,000 times.
However, honoring the soon-to-be Harvard freshman rather than America’s independence from Britain caused many people to cry foul.
‘It’s 4th of July whether you like it or not,’ tweeted one person.
‘All of you need help for disrespecting the country and the people who fight to preserve the independence we have,’ wrote another.
According to Page Six, Malia kicked off her 19th birthday by celebrating at Surf Lodge in Montauk, New York, with friends.
She was also seen chatting up actress Rosario Dawson and Surf Lodge owner Jayma Cardoso, as well as grabbing a bite at the Golden Pear in Southampton during her birthday weekend.
Reportedly, Malia and her friends topped off the night with a candle-riddled brownie dessert.
The teenager has been spotted in the New York City over the past year due to her internship with the Harvey Weinstein Company before she heads off to Harvard. Several took to Twitter to celebrate ‘Malia Obama Day’ on July 4th instead of Independence Day, sparking outrage that they were disrespecting the United States
I honestly do not blame Malia Obama for this disgrace to our nation. I have my own persona rule, not to attack the children of the families of Presidents or former Presidents. This disgrace of an act belongs to Barack and Michelle Obama. Instead of a thank you tour like President Trump did, traveling around the country showing gratitude to the people that elected him into office, Obama traveled in the Middle East, excluding Israel. He traveled through Arab countries in an apologetic tour of the United States to its enemies, including the fact that Michelle Obama stated, that this was the first time that she was ever proud of America, and the fact they went to a church lead by Reverend Jeremiad Wright who always trashed the United States, and we all know his famous line, “God d@@# America.” We also know that Barack Obama stated to Americans to not be so patriotic on the 4th of July, so this unpatriotic BS from the left has been taught with no accountability for the past eight years.

6 Years Behind Bars Awaits Amish Man Who Didn’t Ask For The Government’s Permission,"Posted by Georgette Walrath | Jul 14, 2017 | Liberal Corruption
In a gross miscarriage of justice, Amish man Samuel Girod was sentenced to six years in federal prison for selling herbal remedies.
In a disturbing example of activists ganging up on a peaceful civilian, a Kentucky man is behind bars because of his religious beliefs. Samuel Girod, father of 12 and grandfather of 25 is an Amish man who was targeted by leftist bureaucrats and sentenced to six years in jail. His crime? Offering herbal remedies for skin disorders.
In 2013, a Missouri resident filed a complaint against the man for selling medicinal products that have been used to treat ailments for centuries. The hate filled liberal contacted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for some inexplicable reason, starting a chain of events that ended with Girod’s incarceration.
The Amish people are targeted by evil liberals because they adhere to their convictions. Their communities are a stellar example of assimilation without compromising religious beliefs. Unlike Muslims, the group peacefully co-exists within American culture, although they shun it in their personal lives.
Community members gathered at the court house to support the local grandfather who is being persecuted by the FDA.
They wear beards and modest clothing, but there’s a huge difference between their beliefs and Muslim invaders. The dissimilarity can be logically traced to their Christian philosophy as opposed to that of radical Islamic conquest. Essentially, the enemy of mankind knows exactly who his enemies are: law-abiding, freedom-loving, Christians and Jews.
Girod had been selling salve remedies for years. They include ingredients like Chickweed and bloodroot, which are extremely common plants that grow all over the U.S. The labels claimed that the balms could treat “dry skin, cuts, burns, draws, and poison ivy.”
He also generated pamphlets that touted the benefits of his homemade products, saying that it treated diaper rash, skin cancer, and fungal infections. However, bloodroot is known for its astringent qualities. According to medical experts, it promotes healing by removing dead skin from the infected areas.
Absolutely no one was harmed by the salves Girod sold, making his harsh sentence a troubling one for religious conservatives.
The FDA investigation determined that the labeling was misleading and demanded he change it, so Girod changed the name of one to “Original Chickweed.” However, the product with bloodroot, called TO-MOR-GONE was deemed a danger to the public, and the federal agency demanded to inspect his manufacturing process.
Because Girod made his products at home, that meant that investigators would have to enter his Old Order community and defile it. His religious beliefs mandate that the modern world be avoided. As a recognized and protected class, Girod said that since the products were herbal, they weren’t subject to FDA compliance laws.
However, the feds didn’t agree. They decided that the products should be under their jurisdiction and proceeded to make his life miserable. He was scheduled to attend a judicial status hearing last August, but again, his religious beliefs prohibited it. By missing the appearance, the government labeled him a fugitive. He was arrested at his family farm and held without bail.
Carlton S. Shier, acting U.S. attorney, arrogantly announced that Girod “brazenly placed the public at risk, openly hampered law enforcement, and intentionally impeded the judicial process.”
No one knows where government officials thought the grandfather would flee. He’d lived in the same community his entire life, but apparently, this Christian was a flight risk. The Bath County Sheriff John Snedegar petitioned to have Girod released.
Sheriff Richard Mack traveled from Arizona to support his friend Girod, but no amount of right could stop the justice system from harming an entire community.
Snedegar wrote a letter asking why the FDA was so set on was “attacking and victimizing such peaceful and law-abiding Americans.” He added that he “would not stand by while the rights of peaceful people are violated.”
The entire Kentucky community agreed. Over 27,000 signatures graced an online petition demanding his immediate freedom. Neighbor Suza Moody said, “I can’t even figure out what he has done wrong. They live at the foot of the cross and the thought of one of them intentionally doing something wrong is outrageous.”
During the court proceedings Girod acted in his own defense, claiming his immunity as a member of a protected religious order, but that wasn’t enough. Judge Reed sentenced him to six years in federal prison and another three years of released supervision.
Sheriff Richard Mack discussed the ruling saying, “it’s our job in government to prevent injustice! And that’s what this foolish judge does NOT get!”
Girod was also ordered to pay over $1,300 in fines and $14,000 in restitution fees for his so-called crime. This is clearly an example of federal overreach. It points to the clear battle being drawn against followers of Christ and followers of evil.
The community wept and prayed as the verdict was delivered. For a man who is used to open outdoors, the sentence is tantamount to serious physical harm.
In case concerned citizens would like to contact the individuals responsible for the gross miscarriage of justice, the officials include Carlton S. Shier IV, and Mark McCormack, Special Agent in Charge, FDA Office of Criminal Investigations. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Kate K. Smith and Todd Bradbury.
The verdict was read amid weeping, and when prosecutors filed out of the court, a large crowd booed and asked how they could do such a thing. Perhaps if Girod had sold his salves at a Head shop or some other “alternative” store, he would not be behind bars.
The only thing Girod did wrong was come into the cross hairs of a leftist hater and a bureaucracy that is intent on punishing upright, moral behavior. His injustice must not be forgotten, it must be swiftly rectified.",Conservative Daily Post,1

New York Times have quoted anonymous sources saying Daniel Craig will reprise his role, but neither lead actor nor director have been confirmed
Tuesday 25 July 2017 20.11 EDTLast modified on Tuesday 25 July 2017 20.18 EDT
He is the original international man of mystery – so perhaps it is not surprising that there is still a cloak of secrecy over who will take on the mantle of James Bond in the secret agent’s next outing.
Film company Eon Productions, which produces Bond movies, and Metro Goldwyn Mayer, which owns the rights to the long-running franchise, said on Tuesday that the latest instalment would be released in November 2019.
But whether Daniel Craig will be saving the world in the title role has yet to be confirmed.
The New York Times quoted two anonymous sources as saying the actor, who has appeared as 007 in four films, would be returning in what will be the 25th outing featuring the secret agent.
Eon and MGM did not confirm the cast or who will oversee the action – it is rumoured that Christopher Nolan is in line for the director’s chair – but the New York Times quote two unidentified sources as saying Craig’s return is a ‘done deal’.
Speculation has swirled around whether he would continue in the role and who could take on the mantle if he was to step aside.
Now 49, Craig had said at a event to promote his last outing, Spectre, that starring in the film was a gruelling experience and he would not do so again. In later interviews, he backtracked and stated he would consider another stint in the role.
The announcement that the film would be out next year included the news that the screenplay will be written by Neil Purvis and Robert Wade. They penned Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall and Spectre – instalments that, along with Craig’s performances, critics say have breathed new life in to the franchise.",The Guardian – US,0
Angelina Jolie Calls Biological Daughter an ‘Outcast’ for Her Blonde Hair and Blue Eyes,"Written by Keely Sharp
Slow clap for Angelina Jolie in not only allowing her little girl, Shiloh, to believe she is a boy but for also making her feel like an outcast due to her blonde hair and blue eyes.
How can a mother look at her child and call her an outcast for having the biological attributes that you and her father gave her? Simply because she does not look like Jolie’s other adopted children from other countries. Of course Shiloh isn’t going to look like them!
Shiloh should not be shamed for how she looks, just because she doesn’t look foreign. Although, they did ensure that she as born in another country to make sure she would be a different nationality.
In 2008, Brad Pitt talked about the child during an interview with Oprah Winfrey, telling her that Shiloh only responded to the name John or Peter. Shiloh was born on 27 May in 2006 in Swakopmund, Namibia. His parents reserved the entire wing of a hospital and programmed the cesarean so that Shiloh could have Namibian – and not US – nationality.
This is an older article from Daily Mail, but I think it is important to realize how people are treating their children, because those children grow up and then we wonder why they act the way they do. Reasons like this are why.
TRENDING ON EAGLE RISING
The actress – who has adopted three other children from around the world – said in a revealing interview, that her only biological child, fathered by actor Brad Pitt, is the odd one out because of her bright blonde hair.
Jolie and and Brad Pitt also adopted Maddox from Cambodia, Pax Thien from Vietnam, and Zahara from Ethiopia.
[The] Beowulf star explained Shiloh’s resemblance to her father which set her apart from her siblings.
Angelina told Look magazine: “She looks like Brad. It’s funny because she’s almost going to be the outcast in the family because she’s blonde and blue-eyed.”
Jolie also admitted she would have been happy not to have a biological child.
But she changed her mind after seeing Brad with Zahara and Maddox after bringing her to the U.S. from Ethiopia.
She said: “I saw Brad with her and Maddox, and I realised how much he loved them – and how a biological child would not in any way be a threat.”
The actress said she felt a deep connection to her adopted children because of the pain they had endured in their young lives.
She added: “I felt so much more for Madd, Zahara and Pax because they were survivors.
“Shiloh seemed so privileged from the moment she was born.
“But I’m conscious that I have to make sure I don’t ignore her needs, just because I think the others are more vulnerable.”
It’s as if she has resented her her blue eyed, blonde haired baby girl since birth. She feels as if Shiloh has been privileged her entire life. Perhaps that’s why Shiloh is “allowed” (or convinced) to dress like a boy and act as if she is transgendered. Maybe that’s Jolie’s way of implementing some kind of diversity to make Shiloh seem less like an “outcast.”
In fact, 11-year-old Shiloh is about to start hormone treatments to stop female hormones from being produced so that she can start turning into a boy.
Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt’s first biological child has embarked on hormone treatment to block the development of female sexual characteristics according to a report by AFP. Shiloh is 11 but has known since he was four that the gender assigned to him at birth is not the one he identifies with.
The family is also reportedly open to the possibility that Shiloh may undergo sex-change surgery in the future.
Shiloh has been very clear about his feelings from a very young age. And his parents have always publicly supported his transsexuality. In a 2010 interview with Vanity Fair, Angelina Jolie explained that Shiloh liked to dress as a boy and that this wasn’t a problem for her or Brad.
Sounds to me like they have confused this poor child into believe things about herself that simply aren’t true, in order to set her apart.

EVERYBODY’s Talking About The Crazy Thing Trump Wore On His Jacket at The G20… It’s Incredible,"While everyone else attending the G20 Summit in Germany wore the G20 pin, it took Trump to dare to be different, and to represent America as a true and strong leader!
HE WORE AN AMERICAN FLAG LAPEL PIN, INSTEAD!
Check it out again.
And he showed his dominance, power and strength when he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin too!
This was a much-anticipated meeting for all, and all eyes (and cameras) were focused on this meeting between these two very powerful men.
One person who watched the encounter intently was body language expert Lillian Glass. And not surprisingly, her take was that President Trump was the most dominant leader of the two!
In her expert opinion, “Trump [was] completely taking control,” in the way he leaned in.
She also analyzed the expression on Putin’s face and added, “He is not used to another leader taking control. He is usually the one in control of things.”

WATCH – Hillary Caught On Video Doing THIS in NY. People Are Asking SERIOUS Questions.,"Spotting Hillary Clinton in the last 65 days has not been an easy thing. Some have said it is harder than hunting for Bigfoot.
But, the Democrat who lost on November 8 resurfaced this week at Milo’s in Midtown Manhattan. After dinner with Bill Clinton, Ted Danson and his wife, Mary Steenburgen, the former presidential candidate appeared to be intoxicated as she made her way to her waiting transportation.
In fact, it even appears that former President Bill Clinton was also hammered. They must have had some serious alcohol inside Milo’s that night.
As Hillary makes her way through the revolving door, her speaking volume is higher than normal, which often consistent with a person who is drunk. Her walking pace is slow and she even appears to stumble as she heads for the car.
Bill seems even more aloof, twice asking Ted Danson if they needed a ride. Clearly, his mind is slowed and he is repeating himself. The Dansons are in much better condition than the Clintons and seem to be trying to help them safely get to their vehicle.
Throughout the last year there have been countless accounts of Hillary’s drinking. Many have wondered if she is an alcoholic, especially after Secret Service officers leaked that she was drinking vodka in the morning hours on the campaign trail.
Conversely, President-Elect Donald Trump doesn’t drink alcohol. Not a drop. Neither does former Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney. George W. Bush? The same.
And then there is the outgoing president, Democrat Barack Obama, who has been accused of partying too hard (including questions about marijuana usage in the White House). His own words (from his book The Audacity of Hope) tell us that he has had a hankering in the past, for certain.
So, there seems to be an interesting pattern here. On one hand, we have leadership that is sober, disciplined and always in control. On the other, powerful figures who check out of reality on a regular basis, submitting to outside stimulants.
So, if the law prohibits one from drinking and driving, are we okay with someone drinking and leading our country? Do we not need that person to be alert 24 hours a day during their four year term? Is that asking too much?
America narrowly escaped putting another volatile, substance-using person in the Oval Office at a time when we need to seriously reconstruct our nation. We the People are thrilled that President-Elect Trump is a sober-minded man. Literally.

New Delusional Theory From CNN: Putin Put Jill Stein Forward To Hurt Hillary (VIDEO),"This is so dumb. Bear in mind as you watch the clip below that the CNN host is Michael Smerconish. He’s supposedly one of the “conservative” hosts on CNN.
Why must people in the media make fools of themselves every single day?
CNN’s Smerconish to Jill Stein: Did Putin Elevate You to Hurt Hillary?
CNN’s Michael Smerconish spoke with 2016 Green party candidate Jill Stein this morning about Russian interference in the election and whether she was personally used by Vladimir Putin.
One of the chyrons that ran during the segment asked “Was Jill Stein a Pawn in Putin’s Plot to Elect Trump?”
Smerconish brought up how Stein was at an RT event in late 2015 sitting at the same table as Putin and Michael Flynn, so he asked her if she thinks Putin giving her that platform was “a form of meddling” in the election.
Stein talked about the need to make voting systems more secure, but Smerconish brought the conversation back to the 2015 dinner and the “prominence” it gave her.
She said her appearance wasn’t exactly a “public relations bump” and told Smerconish she was talking about a “peace offensive in the Middle East”––a message that “was not particularly friendly to the Russians.”

HYPOCRITE: George Clooney Moving Back To U.S. Amid Terror Concerns,"George Clooney is perhaps the biggest mouthpiece on the left for refugees. He and his wife, Amal Alamuddin, are leaving their digs in England to return to the U.S. citing safety fears due to terrorism.
Bizpac Review has the story:
George Clooney, a pro-Islam advocate and proponent of open borders, will reportedly move back to the United States, citing security concerns for his wife and newborn twins in terrorism-ravaged Britain.
While he was blowing his own horn during the refugee debate, for more open borders and a free flow of refugees into our own country, he fled to England, and by-the-way, never housed a single refugee in his own home. Just sayin’.
… And now, George plans to move his wife, Amal (a Lebanese-Brit who was raised Muslim) and their newborn twins back to Los Angeles after a spate of terrorist attacks rocked England.
… Sources said Clooney amped up security once his wife Amal (née Amal Alamuddin) got pregnant:
“As soon as Amal found out she was pregnant, he hired former Secret Service agents to assess all his properties and make recommendations for improvement. His mansion in Studio City [California] was deemed the most secure, and it’s within minutes of an LAPD station. He’s waited so long for this family. He’ll do whatever it takes to keep them safe.”
The insider said George had received threats in the past for his humanitarian work in the Sudan, and his wife’s work as a human rights lawyer has also made her the target of threats.
This isn’t the first time a George Clooney residence has made headlines. In July 2016, Clooney’s neighbors in the upscale Italian resort town of Lake Como were furious after their picturesque hamlet was destroyed by a barrage of refugees.
Even for an elitist liberal like Clooney, this has to be just a little embarrassing.

The Breakdown puts a selection of Australia’s daily news into context. Today’s picks:
• A man walking across the country for the rights of indigenous Australians reaches New South Wales.
• “Game of Thrones” premiere falls flat
• More to come ...
Closing In on the End of a Long Road
Meeting the prime minister might require some finagling, but one man is walking across Australia to try to do so. Clinton Pryor of Perth is walking toward Sydney on his way to Parliament in Canberra to champion rights for indigenous Australians.
“I want to tell the prime minister to give elders the full control over the community,” Mr. Pryor wrote on his website, where he describes himself as a “Wajuk, Balardung, Kija and a Yulparitja man from the West.”
Mr. Pryor, worried that government interference will lead to the defunding of services for indigenous Australian communities, wants to ask Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to “give us a treaty and let us live our life how we always have done.”
Continue reading the main story
His crossing into New South Wales comes during a week in which indigenous issues are high on the political agenda. On Monday, a panel set up by the prime minister urged that a referendum be held to vote on whether to establish a body to represent indigenous Australian interests.

The body would allow “the First Peoples of Australia to speak to the Parliament and to the nation about the laws and policies that concern them,” the panel said.
Although in line with calls from the Uluru Statement From the Heart to establish “a First Nations voice enshrined in the Constitution,” it did not address its broader requests.
Mr. Pryor began his journey at Heirisson Island in September and is about 4,700 kilometers, or more than 2,900 miles, into his walk. He has meticulously documented his journey online through maps and time sheets and, of course, on Twitter. Here are a few highlights.

Sometimes you do the right thing and are punished for it.
For those Australian “Game of Thrones” viewers who decided to pony up and purchase a Foxtel digital subscription — one of the few legal ways for Australians to watch the series on the same day it airs in the United States — the Season 7 premiere was a literal non-event, after the cable provider’s online and on-demand services crashed.
In a bashful Facebook post, Foxtel apologised to its digital customers, blaming “unprecedented demand” for its services going down.
“We are devastated that some customers experienced technical issues tonight,” Bruce Meagher, a Foxtel spokesman, said.

Last year, when the sixth season of “Game of Thrones” premiered, it was revealed that Australia was the world’s worst offender when it comes to pirating the show. According to TorrentFreak, the country accounted for 13 percent of the global torrent traffic for that episode.
Foxtel has aggressively launched several Federal Court cases to try to block piracy-streaming websites in Australia. In 2016, it successfully forced Australia’s internet service providers to block The Pirate Bay, the notorious torrent hub.
The cable provider’s disastrous night — which followed its monthslong “Game of Thrones” promotional campaign — has left fans of the series wondering what to do next.
The Game of Thrones premiere date “was known for over a year,” one Facebook user commented, in response to Foxtel’s post. “What is ‘unprecedented’ about the most watched show in the world premiering after a year’s gap?”
“Get ready for more ‘unprecedented demand’ every Monday for the next 7-8 weeks,” the man continued.
Isabella Kwai gets tired quickly over long distances. Adam Baidawi is yet to tell close friends that he doesn’t watch Game of Thrones.

Ex-Trump AIDS council warns that new Senate healthcare bill ‘will kill people’ with the disease,"22 Jun 2017 at 19:56 ET

Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story!
According to BuzzFeed News, members of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS (PACHA) who resigned last week in protest believe that the GOP Senate’s new healthcare bill will constitute a death sentence for people with the disease.
“I would say it’s at least as bad as the old House one — maybe worse, depending on where it goes from here,” Scott Schoettes, Lambda Legal’s HIV Project Director and former member of PACHA told BuzzFeed News. “It will kill people — that’s not hyperbole. There will be some people who will die from this.”
Schoettes resigned with five other PACHA colleagues last week in protest of an administration and “president who simply does not care” about people who live with HIV or AIDS.
Though Trump himself has said little about the disease, Vice President Mike Pence is a well known opponent of HIV/AIDS programs, and took more than two months to respond to an epidemic of the disease in one Indiana county when he was governor of the state.
Schoettes’ fellow PACHA member and HIV prevention expert Gina Brown told BuzzFeed that the bill’s plans to downsize “essential health benefits like maternal health, mental health, substance abuse treatment, and funding to Planned Parenthood will impact both people with HIV/AIDS and those at risk of contracting the disease.”
“Also, expanded Medicaid would be scaled back and because there’s no penalty for not having health insurance, a lot of people will not purchase it,” Brown told BuzzFeed. “I fear we are going backwards, back to a place where people went bankrupt trying to pay for medical emergencies.”
Despite four conservative Republican senators coming out against the party’s current iteration of the Obamacare repeal bill, Schoettes said he isn’t optimistic.
“Most conservative Republicans who want deeper cuts have already come out against the bill, which means if it’s going to move anywhere it’s just going to become worse instead of being improved,” he said. “It’s really upsetting because I know, having worked in the epidemic, that this is going to affect real people I know living with this disease.”

TOPICS TRENDING JOIN US! CROOKED INTENTIONS: Look What Hillary Clinton And Mueller Have Teamed Up To Do,"Alice Ali 4 hours agoNews32 Views
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton facilitated the transfer of highly enriched uranium (HEU). It was previously confiscated by the US Department of Energy (DOE) during the 2006 “nuclear smuggling sting operation involving one Russian national and several Georgian accomplices” according to Wikileaks.
Look what Mueller did for Hillary Clinton.
According to Zero Hedge, information has been provided in the WikiLeaks cable which says that the US government took possession of uranium that was owned by Russians.
“Over two years ago Russia requested a ten-gram sample of highly enriched uranium (HEU) seized in early 2006 in Georgia during a nuclear smuggling sting operation involving one Russian national and several Georgian accomplices. The seized HEU was transferred to U.S. custody and is being held at a secure DOE facility.”
This is crazy! This is crazy! The cable proposes that FBI Director Robert Mueller personally conducted a transfer of 10-grams of HEU to Russian law enforcement on a “plane-side” meeting on the “tarmac” in 2009 This is crazy.
“WE REQUIRE THAT THE TRANSFER OF THIS MATERIAL BE CONDUCTED AT THE AIRPORT, ON THE TARMAC NEAR BY THE PLANE, UPON ARRIVAL OF THE DIRECTOR’S AIRCRAFT.”
Take a look at Paragraph number 6 of the leaked memo. This is a bombshell.
“(S/Rel Russia) Action request: Embassy Moscow is requested to alert at the highest appropriate level the Russian Federation that FBI Director Mueller plans to deliver the HEU sample once he arrives to Moscow on September 21. Post is requested to convey information in paragraph 5 with regard to chain of custody, and to request details on Russian Federation’s plan for picking up the material. Embassy is also requested to reconfirm the April 16 understanding from the FSB verbally that we will have no problem with the Russian Ministry of Aviation concerning Mueller’s September 21 flight clearance.”
State Department wanted the transfer to take place on the “airport tarmac.” Doesn’t that sound like the meeting between Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton? Here’s what Newt Gingrich had to say about that.
The cable also details that other deals with the Russians have happened in the past. Help get this information out to the public… SHARE THIS NOW. The media won’t show this at all.

"Naked man cuts off his own penis, frightens residents who tell police to ‘shoot his ass’","July 25, 2017 | Nicole Haas | Print Article
Folks, this is your brain on drugs.
Innocent residents of Chicago’s Irving Park neighborhood were subjected to a horrifying incident when a seemingly drugged-up, naked man went on a wild rampage.
But not before he reportedly cut off his own penis.
That’s right, residents who were luckily separated from the obscenity yelling man by a gate, recorded the scene as he gushed blood from where his penis used to be.
It didn’t take long for Chicago Police to arrive, and like a raging bull, the crazed man charged.
“Oh my God, bro. Shoot his a**,” a man yelled to the Chicago officers. “Shoot that mother f****r. This is a time when you shoot people!”
Officers kept their cool and tasered the naked man instead, but it didn’t take him down for long.
Police were forced to tase him a second time after he got up again to the shock and amazement of horrified onlookers.
That is where the video that has been uploaded to social media ends. There has been no further reports on the identity or condition of the man who was tasered.

Woman FATSPLAINS to man that his joke that she ate a Mexican is UNACCEPTABLE…,"Jul. 3, 2017 7:45 pm by SooperMexican • No Comments
There is a joke in this story that is VERY UNACCEPTABLE and you should NOT LAUGH at it because if you do you are adding to the culture of fat-shaming and you should be ashamed, you should be fat-shame-shamed, or fat-shame-squared if you’re into that whole algebra thing.
Anyway a fat woman got angry that a dude was making jokes about her on a plane. It’s AWFUL!!
There’s a joke about a Mexican too:
It’s amazing to me that this is even news, but OK.
Natalie Hage of Dallas, Texas, is a full-time student, plus-size model, and social media influencer. She’s built a platform on promoting body positivity and health at every size — but on Friday, Hage’s message was put to the test when she came face to face with a body shamer on an American Airlines flight to Los Angeles.
Hage, 30, had paid nearly $70 for extra leg room, and boarded to find only middle seats remaining. Upon sitting down, the welcome she received from the man to her left was less than warm. “I could tell from the second I walked up that he was bothered,” she told TODAY. “He was making it very clear — jerkily arranging himself in his seat, slamming his seat belt — obviously distressed that I was alive next to him. I almost asked him if he was OK, it was so dramatic.”
Then she noticed him putting his phone between his knees, with his finger near the camera button. She suspected he was taking pictures of her — and when she glanced down at his phone, she saw a stream of derogatory comments that the man didn’t even seem to be trying to hide.
“Hopefully she didn’t have any Mexican food,” said whoever was on the other end of the text message.
“I think she ate a Mexican,” the man had responded, later adding, “If the news reports a DFW Airbus A321 leaving the runway without rotating, that would be my flight.”
Why is it bad to “mansplain” to women, but it’s ok for women to fatsplain to us?! That ain’t fair!!!
Look, I am not a small man, since burritos are so delicious, but the last time I was on a plane this dude that weighed like 350 lbs (no joke) sat next to me, and wow was that uncomfortable. I was nice to the guy, but my arm was literally enveloped by his fat. Are we to not say anything when stuff like this happens?

U.S. Senate Republicans to issue revised health bill to win support: aide,"Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) speaks after Senate Republicans unveiled their version of legislation that would replace Obamacare on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 22, 2017.
WASHINGTON U.S. Senate Republicans plan to issue a revised version of their healthcare bill on Monday, according to a Republican Senate aide, as the chamber's leaders scrambled to get legislation passed ahead of a July 4 holiday recess starting on Friday.
The aide, who is familiar with the plan, did not provide details of changes in the works. Politico reported that a likely change to the bill would be to add a provision to encourage people, mainly those who are young and healthy, to enroll in insurance plans.
President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress have been pushing to repeal and replace Obamacare, Democratic former President Barack Obama's signature domestic legislation. The House of Representatives passed its version of a healthcare bill last month.
The Senate bill unveiled last week was immediately criticized by both conservatives and moderates in the party. With Republicans holding only a 52-seat majority in the 100-seat Senate, the bill was unlikely to win passage in its initial form.
At least four conservative Republicans have expressed opposition to the draft legislation, saying it does not go far enough in repealing Obamacare.
A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would not comment on whether a vote on a bill would be held in the full Senate on Thursday, as originally anticipated.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office later Monday might release its assessment of the bill's cost and impact on future budget deficits. It was not clear whether the report will also estimate how many people might lose healthcare coverage under the legislation or whether that estimate would come later.
Meanwhile, some moderate Republicans have either withheld judgment or expressed doubts about replacing Obamacare with legislation that is similar to the House version.
They are concerned that the party's approach to healthcare would cause too many people, and especially those with low incomes, to lose insurance. Trump touted passage of the House bill as a victory but later called it ""mean.""
Republicans have targeted Obamacare since it was passed in 2010, viewing it as costly government intrusion and saying individual insurance markets are collapsing. The legislation expanded health coverage to some 20 million Americans, through provisions such as mandating that individuals obtain health insurance and expanding Medicaid, the government program for the poor.
As he did during the House negotiations, Trump has personally pushed for a Senate bill, calling fellow Republicans to mobilize support.
In the efforts by Senate Republicans to push through a bill, the party has split over a provision in the draft bill ending federal funding of Planned Parenthood, the women's healthcare provider, for one year.
Moderates are wary of this, while conservatives have called for an end to federal funding of Planned Parenthood because it provides abortions, even though they are not performed with taxpayer dollars.
Health insurance companies are concerned about the bill's plan to cut Medicaid and any impact on state governments as well as the prospect of losing Obamacare's mandate on individuals to buy insurance without creating alternative incentives for people to stay in their plans.
If the Senate passes a bill, it will either have to be approved by the House, the two chambers would have to reconcile their differences in a conference committee, or the House could pass a new version and bounce it back to the Senate.
The House is also controlled by Republicans but faced a similar balancing act between moderates and conservatives to pass its version.
A Republican leadership aide in the House said if the Senate manages to pass a healthcare bill this week, no decision has been made on when the House might schedule a vote on it or whether House Republicans might seek any changes to the Senate measure.

President Donald Trump Sued for Blocking Twitter Users,"President Donald Trump has been sued by a free-speech group, which claims his practice of blocking Twitter users violates the First Amendment.
Trump, who uses the @realDonaldTrump account in office, has been sued by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University in New York, along with seven individual Twitter users. The suit claims that Trump’s blocking of users who are critical of him is a violation of the U.S. Constituion.
“President Trump’s Twitter account, @realDonaldTrump, has become an important source of news and information about the government, and an important public forum for speech by, to, and about the President,” the lawsuit reads. “In an effort to suppress dissent in this forum, Defendants have excluded— ‘blocked’ —Twitter users who have criticized the President or his policies. This practice is unconstitutional, and this suit seeks to end it.”
The suit claims it is a violation to suppress dissent. The lawsuit was filed in the federal court in the Southern District of New York.
Trump often takes to Twitter to discuss public policy, including his thoughts on the war against terror, healthcare and other affairs, both foreign and domestic. Henceforth, the suit says the government is not allowed to exclude people, no matter their view on a situation.
White House spokesman Sean Spicer noted in June that Trump’s tweets are official statements and the White House often sends out official statements everytime the President tweets.
Trump, along with Spicer and Dan Scavino, the White House director of social media, are named as defendants in the lawsuit.
The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University is a New York City-based 501(c)(3) organization “that works to defend and strengthen the freedoms of speech and the press in the digital age through strategic litigation, research, and public education,” according to the complaint.
The seven individual plaintiffs in the suit are writer and political consultant Rebecca Buckwalter, professor Philip Cohen, political organizer Holly Figueroa, resident in general surgery Eugene Gu, police officer Brandon Neely, former professional cyclist Joseph Papp and comic/writer Nicholas Pappas.
The federal suit is case number 1:17-cv-05205.

YouTuber Hilariously Trolls Fox Host By Posing As ‘Antifa’ Member (VIDEO/TWEETS),"GooglePinterestDiggLinkedin Reddit Stumbleupon PrintDeliciousPocketTumblr
Another title for this post could have been ‘A Troll Trolls A Troll.’ Fox News’s Jesse Watters’ interview with a man posing as an “Antifa” member had Twitter users losing their shit. There were clues in the interview with ‘Kevin’ that should have made Watters curious as to whether he was legit but the Fox News host really thought he had something.
Subscribe to our Youtube Channel
The Fox ‘News’ host on Saturday used his ‘Watters World’ episode to interview “Kevin,” who was posing as a member of the Boston Antifa branch.
Here’s how Watters got punked:
He brought “Kevin” on because he took credit for an anonymous open letter that was published and he allegedly wrote, “It is time for liberals and progressives to lose their illusions about the anarchist movement and our tactics because, quite frankly, you have no one else willing to fight for you.”
Watters kept pressing Kevin on violence that he attributed to the Antifa movement but ‘Kevin’ said the violence is meant to be self-defense from “racists and xenophobes” that “attack” him and his group at peaceful protests. Then ‘Kevin’ accused “right wing infiltrators” of being responsible for the violence, riots, and vandalism that have occurred and said their aim is to place the blame on the protestors.
In mid-June, a protester, who claims to be with Antifa, was accused of hitting a state police horse with a flagpole topped with a nail during a rally, so Watters asked him about that.
Watters asked if the police horse was a “racist Trump supporter.”
Kevin told Watters that “yes,” the horse is a racist and a “tool of the police” that have become “increasingly intolerant” ever since Trump’s election.
Watters was appalled and so was the Internet. One Twitter user wrote, “Watch Antifa degenerate say police horse deserved to be stabbed in neck b/c he (the horse) is a racist Trump supporter…& he’s dead serious” and he included a clip of the video.
The only problem is that he wasn’t ‘dead serious.’ The alleged Antifa member, “Kevin,” goes by BG Kumbi on YouTube and he even uploaded the Fox News interview under the “comedy” category.
Even Michael Cernovich, who pushed the debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory, knew that it was a hoax.

MELBOURNE, Australia — Cardinal George Pell, one of Pope Francis’ top advisers, made his first court appearance in Australia on Wednesday after becoming the highest-ranking Roman Catholic prelate to be formally charged with sexual offenses.
Cardinal Pell, 76, was flanked by police officers as he entered Melbourne Magistrates’ Court through a thicket of camera crews, reporters and photographers.
He said nothing during the filing hearing, which lasted about six minutes.
One of the cardinal’s lawyers, Robert Richter, told the court that his client would plead not guilty to all charges and vehemently maintained his innocence. Magistrate Duncan Reynolds set the next court proceeding for Oct. 6.
Journalists from around the world started lining up outside the court as early as 5 a.m. to get a seat at the hearing, which was purely administrative in nature and allowed the magistrate to set dates for future hearings.

“It is rumored that one international news outlet will have a dozen journalists and photographers in place to cover the cardinal’s appearance,” a journalist from Fairfax Media, one of Australia’s most powerful media organizations, wrote on Monday.

The unspecified charges of sexual offenses drew global attention after the police in the Australian state of Victoria said last month that the cardinal had been charged on summons and was required to appear in the magistrates’ court here.
Shortly afterward, the Vatican announced that Francis had granted a leave of absence to Cardinal Pell, who vowed to fight the charges, calling them false and the result of “relentless character assassination.”
“The whole idea of sexual abuse is abhorrent to me,” he said at a news conference in Rome last month.
Cardinal Pell returned to his native Australia on July 10, and he was met by the Australian Federal Police at Sydney’s international airport. He has kept a low profile since arriving.
The start of Cardinal Pell’s court battle in Melbourne revisits a troubled past for his hometown, Ballarat, about 75 miles west of Melbourne, which experts say was among the towns with the worst cases of abuse by church clerics.

A 2013 state government inquiry exposed accounts of child abuse and accusations of a cover-up in the Ballarat Diocese over many generations, and around that same time, the Royal Commission Into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse was created. The commission heard accusations against several priests in Ballarat, some of whom have been jailed for abuse.
Cardinal Pell testified before the commission about the handling of complaints against the church, but neither inquiry heard complaints against the cardinal. Cardinal Pell served as a priest in Ballarat in the 1970s and ’80s. In 1996, he became the archbishop of Melbourne, and later he was installed as Sydney’s archbishop.
Andrew Collins, 48, who said he was abused in Ballarat in the 1970s and ’80s by four men, three of them Catholic clergy members, said the court case against Cardinal Pell was big news for sexual abuse victims.

“Ten years ago, I doubt that this would have happened,” Mr. Collins said, “that an official from the Vatican or someone with the rank as high as cardinal would ever have ended up in court.”
The case will test the credibility of Francis’ efforts to foster greater accountability after abuse scandals that have shaken the church around the world.
In recent decades, more than 50 Roman Catholic bishops worldwide have been accused of sexually abusing children, according to BishopAccountability.org, an advocacy group in Massachusetts that documents sexual abuse in the church. Few, however, have faced criminal charges.
It is rare for a cardinal, a prince of the church, to be accused of sexual abuse.
“There must be perpetrators out there who would be looking at this thinking if a cardinal can be charged, anyone can be,” Mr. Collins said.
“It gives survivors faith in the system again.”

"They Crossed The Line! CAIR Calls For Removal of Trump, Overthrow of the U.S. Government","POLITICS US CONSERVATIVE NEWS
 
July 21, 2017July 21, 2017Alex D.3 Views 0 Comments# Donald Trump, CAIR
If Trump caves, these Hamas-tied saboteurs will be considerably emboldened and will start issuing more and more demands. As it is, they’re deeply afraid: after eight years of being coddled and cosseted by Obama, it is possible once again that they will face federal prosecution. Eight years too late, but still — most welcome and much needed.
Hussam Ayloush is the head of the Los Angeles chapter of CAIR, and he has reportedly encouraged Muslim Americans to stand up and overthrow the government. Here is his actual tweet:
Ok, repeat after me:
Al-Shaab yureed isqat al-nizaam.
— Hussam Ayloush (@HussamA) November 9, 2016
Ayloush’s chant is from the Arab Spring, but it translates to, “The people want to overthrow the regime,” according to WND. This tweet was published on the night of November 8. MSM was silent on this topic again!
This was, of course, when many of us first found out that Donald Trump had won the election and had become the president-elect. So, it’s obvious that this tweet is meant for Donald Trump’s leadership and not for anybody else.
As The Federalist Papers reports, this is a direct call to Muslims to take over America’s government:
It was a slogan first used during the Tunisian revolution, which kicked off the Arab Spring, where dozens of totalitarian Islamic nations were either toppled or faced serious street demonstrations. It was also the slogan during the overthrow of Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak.
Ayloush is not just a nominal figure in Leftist circles. In 2012, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention and has attended at least two White House meetings, Daniel Pipes is reporting.
The [White House] logs show Ayloush met with Paul Monteiro, associate director of the White House Office of Public Engagement on July 8, 2011 and Amanda Brown, assistant to the White House director of political affairs Patrick Gaspard, on June 6, 2009. According to reliable sources, Monteiro was White House liaison for secret contacts with CAIR, especially with Ayloush.
For the record, advocating the overthrow of the U.S. Government is an extremely serious crime. In 18 U.S. Code § 2385, it reads:
“Whoever knowingly or willfully advocates, abets, advises, or teaches the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying the government of the United States… Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.”
Ayloush has since said the tweet was some sort of an inside joke that only Muslims could get.
This is a serious crime, and with his influence in the Islamic Community, that Tweet shouldn’t be considered a joke. He’s playing into the anti-Trump narrative that the liberal media has created, and is fanning the flames of racial hatred.

GOP senators’ new health care proposal could save Obamacare repeal and replace effort,"Justin Haskins 7 hours

A new health care reform proposal offered by three Republican senators could be Senate Republicans’ last hope at passing a health care reform bill to replace Obamacare without relying on Democratic Party senators, who will likely refuse to make substantial changes to the existing system.
Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.) and Dean Heller (R-Nev.) met with President Donald Trump and top White House officials on Friday to discuss their plan, which they believe could get the approval of 50 senators, according to a report by Politico. Although the details of the proposal are not entirely clear and are still in development, the basic outline of the proposal is the funds currently provided by the federal government for Medicaid and Obamacare would be provided to the states in the form of block grants.
Block grants are funds given to states with limited strings attached, allowing states to determine how best to use the money. By block granting Medicaid and Obamacare funds to states, both conservatives and moderates could be appeased, because conservative states would implement programs that promote pro-liberty, free-market policies while more liberal states would likely keep much of Obamacare in place, although all states would have great freedom in choosing how to use their share of the federal funds.
It’s not clear from the information that’s been released so far what the associated requirements would be. For instance, would states be allowed to use funds to pay for abortions? Must states continue to force health insurance companies who provide subsidized coverage to provide the costly ACA essential health benefits?
Greater flexibility would likely appeal to conservative senators, such as Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Mike Lee (R-Utah), but it could alienate some moderates, such as Susan Collins (R-Maine), who might not want states to have the freedom to restructure their Medicaid programs.
The downside to such a model, from a conservative perspective, is more-liberal states, such as California, Illinois, New York and Vermont, will likely expand government’s role in health care using federal taxpayer funds. Runaway Medicaid costs and other government funding concerns would also continue to plague the health care system.
However, despite these challenges, Graham, Cassidy and Heller believe this could be the only chance for Republicans to replace Obamacare, and it’s true that once states are given this kind of flexibility, it’s likely they will fight to keep it.
“I had a great meeting with the President and know he remains fully committed to repealing and replacing Obamacare,” Graham said in a written statement released on Friday. “President Trump was optimistic about the Graham-Cassidy-Heller proposal. I will continue to work with President Trump and his team to move the idea forward.”
“The legislation was also drafted hand-in-hand with our governors who would be responsible for implementing solutions in their individual states – and who know their citizens better than the bureaucrats in Washington,” Graham added.
“One of the biggest benefits of this approach is it will end the drive toward a national single payer health care system by taking money and power out of Washington and returning it to the people,” Graham said.",TheBlaze,1
"2 Republicans Step Up As Court Rules To Kill Baby, Parents Denied The Right To Act","Posted by Asia Mayfield | Jul 10, 2017 | American Strength
Baby Charlie Gard might be receiving a lifeline. Two U.S. congressmen drafted legislation that would bestow residency status on the terminally ill infant.
Two U.S. congressmen plan to introduce special legislation in a last ditch effort to save baby Charlie Gard. The terminally ill child is currently trapped in the U.K. as doctors and legal experts squabble over the boy’s rights.
The trials afflicting Chris Gard and partner Constance Yates are soul-crushing. Their eleven-month-old child is desperately ill and government bureaucracies are preventing them from trying to save his life. Great Ormond Street Hospital, the London facility currently entrusted with Charlie’s care, has determined that his life is no longer worth preserving.
“Our bill will support Charlie’s parents’ right to choose what is best for their son, by making Charlie a lawful permanent resident in the U.S. in order for him to receive treatments that could save his life,” Reps. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio), and Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) said in a joint statement.
Charlie’s parents amassed over one million dollars in donations, intending to take their child to America for an experimental treatment. Charlie would perhaps be receiving the treatments at this very moment if his travel hadn’t been blocked by Great Ormond Street.
Connie Yates and Chris Gard became embroiled in the British court system after trying to save their son’s life. The couple wants baby Charlie Gard to receive an experimental treatment offered in the U.S.
In a decision supported by three separate European courts, Charlie’s doctors refused to allow his parents to take him from the hospital. Not because they were jealous of his care, but because they determined that baby Charlie didn’t deserve to live.
What is a human life worth? A complicated question, but doctors at Great Ormond Street must be sure that they’ve figured it out if they’re willing to pronounce a death sentence on a child.
Charlie has a serious, terminal disease. His life will be complicated even if the treatment is successful. But he deserves a chance. His parents are still fighting to protect his life and their wishes should be honored. The truth of that sentiment is so patently obvious that powerful offers of help have been raining down on the family since their story first hit airwaves.
The Vatican offered to take control of Charlie’s care. President Trump expressed his condolences and a desire to help the family. If the House legislation is successful, the hospital’s claim on the child will be severely weakened.
Eleven-months-old Charlie Gard suffers from a rare disease that his left him blind, deaf, and unable to breathe or eat without assistance. There’s no known cure but doctors believe that an experimental treatment program could be beneficial.
The hospital is under so much pressure that it’s now offering to fight for Charlie’s right to receive the very treatment they had previously derided.
A hospital spokesman explained: “Two international hospitals and their researchers have communicated to us as late as the last 24 hours that they have fresh evidence about their proposed experimental treatment. We believe, in common with Charlie’s parents, it is right to explore this evidence. Great Ormond Street Hospital is giving the High Court the opportunity to objectively assess the claims of fresh evidence. It will be for the High Court to make its judgment on the facts. Our view has not changed. We believe it is right to seek the High Court’s view in light of the claimed new evidence. Our priority has always been, and will always be, the best interests of Charlie Gard.”
Charlie might still have a chance. A prominent American hospital has offered to either treat the child themselves or provide the necessary medicine to Great Ormond Street.
Charlie’s parents have fought bitterly for their son. His life may now depend on legislation set to be introduced in Congress.
“Every human life has dignity, including the lives of those who cannot speak up for themselves. When government is able to overrule a parent or guardian in determining a patient’s best interest, every vulnerable patient is put at risk. We offer Connie Yates and Chris Gard our heartfelt support as they seek to care for their son,” the representatives’ statement reads.
Time is running out. Charlie needs help NOW. The courts should reverse their deplorable decision and allow his parents to find treatment for him, or U.S. officials may be forced to take matters into their own hands.",Conservative Daily Post,1
Trump Cracks Down: Exposes BILLION DOLLAR Obamacare Fraud,"by Kevin Jackson | Jul 17, 2017
 
Consider how leftists hype issues.
One such issue is opioid abuse. How did this suddenly become mainstream?
Obama watched as use of heroin spiked to crazy proportions, yet he did nothing. In fact, he made it easier for dope heads to get their meds.
These mostly leftist crackhead zombies move from hospital to hospital pretending to be in pain. They then either load up on painkillers for themselves or sell the prescription drugs for harder drugs like heroin.
Hollyweirdos (mostly addicts themselves) do their court-mandate public service announcements on the dangers of drugs, while their leftist enablers pretend to care.
As the NY Daily News reported,
The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday announced charges against 412 people for taking part in healthcare frauds and opioid-related crimes that cost taxpayers about $1.3 billion.
The arrests came as part of what the department said was the largest healthcare fraud takedown in U.S. history. Those arrested included 120 doctors and other people charged for their roles in prescribing and distributing opioid painkillers.
The defendants include six doctors in Michigan accused of operating a scheme to prescribe patients with unnecessary opioids and of billing the Medicare healthcare program for $164 million in fraudulent claims.
Another case involved a fake Florida rehab clinic that recruited addicts with gift cards, visits to strip clubs and even drugs, resulting in $58 million in false treatments and tests, prosecutors said.
U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in Washington that the takedown highlighted the “enormity of the fraud challenge we face.
“This problem is compounded by the fact that our country is in the midst of the deadliest drug crisis in our history,” Sessions added.
But what did Obama do? Nothing good.
In what he described as a “top priority,” Obama explains the problem that Obamacare exacerbated.
As The Hill documents, it only took Obama 7+ years in his presidency to address what he deemed an “epidemic.”
President Obama signed a bill aimed at addressing opioid addiction Friday, though he called out Republicans for the measure’s shortcomings.
Lawmakers in both parties reached a compromise over the bipartisan Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, though Senate Democrats held out hope until the final hour that they could win more funding for treatment.
“This legislation includes some modest steps to address the opioid epidemic,” Obama said in a statement. “Given the scope of this crisis, some action is better than none. However, I am deeply disappointed that Republicans failed to provide any real resources for those seeking addiction treatment to get the care that they need.”
He also noted that GOP lawmakers had blocked an additional $920 million in funding for addiction treatment.
When exactly did opioids become an epidemic worthy of consideration?
As the Washington Examiner reported, Obama knows the outcome of his ineptness.
“This crisis is taking lives. It’s destroying families,” Obama said in Charleston.
Yet the crisis had been building for five years at that point, and critics say Obama’s reactions were too little and too late. Some say his government even contributed to the crisis by approving painkillers liable to abuse.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) first identified prescription drug abuse as a major problem in 2011, when it released statistics that showed more people died from opioid overdoses than from car crashes.
Prescription painkiller and heroin overdose deaths have since risen to all-time highs. From 2009-14, the rate of overdose deaths from heroin abuse increased by 240 percent, from 1 per 100,000 people dying of an overdose to 3.4, according to data from the CDC.
In other words, Obama is the father of the opioid crisis.
And Obamacare was the method of delivery.
Moreover, like a good leftist, Obama tried to solve the problem by throwing money at it.
When you add painkiller overdose deaths to the heroin numbers, the rate of overall deaths increased 25 percent from 2009 (nearly 12 people per 100,000) to 2014 (nearly 15 people), according to the CDC.
Opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, killed more than 33,000 people in the United States in 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
These are pathetic numbers by anybody’s standards. But did you ever hear the media fault Obama for what Obama himself called an “epidemic?” Thankfully, President Trump is a man of action. And that’s why he’s cracking down at the source.
The very doctors who helped addicts exploit Obamacare are going down. Sessions said the charges against the 120 people for opioid-related crimes made the crackdown the biggest of its kind in U.S. history. Why didn’t Obama think of this? Trump’s solution cost the taxpayers nothing, and in fact saved us potentially $1.3 billion.
For those keeping score, Obama cost taxpayers $1 billion for “rehab,” and Trump saved America $1.3 billion. Thus, Trump will recover our $1.3 billion and stop the hemorrhaging by way of fraud.

Governor ARRESTED And CHARGED For Commiting Crimes Against Trump!,"June 27, 2017 by Thomas Rhett
Since that is the case, the reality is California Governor Jerry Brown made an impeachable offense: he did what he states prohibit in his alliance with China, against Congress and the President of the United States.
According to reports, Brown signed an agreement to work with China to lower greenhouse gas emissions Tuesday, just days after President Trump pulled the United States out of an international climate change agreement.
Brown’s office issued a statement saying:
“THE AGREEMENT AIMS TO EXPAND COOPERATION BETWEEN CHINA AND CALIFORNIA ON RENEWABLE ENERGY, ZERO-EMISSION VEHICLES AND LOW-CARBON URBAN DEVELOPMENT. IT WILL ESTABLISH A JOINT WORKING GROUP OF CHINESE AND CALIFORNIAN OFFICIALS TO COME UP WITH WAYS TO WORK TOGETHER, AND TO INVEST IN PROGRAMS THAT WOULD CUT CARBON EMISSIONS.”
Before Brown’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, he met with Wan Gang, China’s minister of science and technology, to sign the pact. He said on Tuesday:
“CALIFORNIA IS THE LEADING ECONOMIC STATE IN AMERICA AND WE ARE ALSO THE PIONEERING STATE ON CLEAN TECHNOLOGY, CAP AND TRADE, ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND BATTERIES, BUT WE CAN’T DO IT ALONE. WE NEED A VERY CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH CHINA, WITH YOUR BUSINESSES, WITH YOUR PROVINCES, WITH YOUR UNIVERSITIES.”",Proud Leader,1
Did Sessions and Trump conspire to obstruct justice?,"Did Attorney General Jeff Sessions conspire with President Donald Trump to fabricate a false story about why former FBI Director James Comey was fired?
If the answer is yes, it could be grounds for criminal prosecution of either Sessions or Trump. And, it could be grounds for impeachment of the president.
It is a crime to “corruptly” endeavor to impede a proceeding before a federal agency. The law says, “corruptly means acting with an improper purpose… including making a false or misleading statement.”
On May 9, President Trump fired Comey in a terse five-sentence letter. It said he was acting on the recommendations of Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Trump attached a letter from Sessions and a memo by Rosenstein. The only basis for dismissal stated in the Rosenstein memo, and adopted by Sessions, was that the FBI director had mishandled the inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server.
However, critics have suggested the real reason Comey was fired was to impede the FBI’s investigation of connections between the Trump campaign and Russia. That would mean Trump’s dismissal letter was a “false” or at least a “misleading” statement, and thus a “corrupt” action in violation of the law.
The most compelling reasons to suspect this are found in the president’s own words later that week. In an interview, Trump told NBC’s Lester Holt: “I was going to fire Comey… regardless of recommendation… [W]hen I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, ‘You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.‘”
Then, when Sessions appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee, he refused to answer key questions about the firing, claiming he owed a duty of confidentiality to the president.
As a scholar of legal ethics and the director of a national institute on teaching ethics and professionalism, I found Sessions’ evasion at the hearing about his May 9 letter to Trump suggests further evidence of a “corrupt purpose” for two reasons:
1. Conflict of interest
Sessions chaired the National Security Advisory Committee for the Trump campaign. He thus had an ethical obligation to consider the possibility that he was or could become a subject of the FBI’s investigation.
On March 2, the attorney general, under considerable outside pressure, announced he would recuse himself “from any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for President.” However, Sessions incorrectly told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he had no further ethical obligation. He went so far as to say his obligation to recuse himself did not “interfere with my ability to oversee… the FBI.”
The attorney general is the country’s top lawyer. According to mandatory ethical rules applicable throughout the country, lawyers are not supposed to provide advice if they have a conflicting personal interest. The attorney general’s willingness to ignore his ethical obligations by advising that Comey be fired raises serious questions about whether he had a corrupt purpose in writing the letter used to fire Comey.
2. An ongoing investigation
Remarkably, neither Sessions nor Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein supported their recommendation to dismiss Comey with any findings from Justice Department officials who usually investigate allegations of misconduct. The only other time an FBI director was outright fired was after a seven-month review of a 161-page report by the Justice Department’s Office of Professional Responsibility.
Neither Sessions nor Rosenstein acknowledged that Comey’s handling of the Clinton email matter was already being reviewed by the Office of the Inspector General.
Of course, Sessions should not have offered the president any advice about firing Comey. But if competent advice were to be given, it surely should have addressed whether to defer the decision until the inspector general completed his work. Neither Sessions nor Rosenstein has yet explained why they omitted reference to the inspector general’s investigation, a failure that raises further doubts about the credibility of the memos they wrote for the president.",The Conversation – Politics,0
"Lalu Prasad Yadav takes on critics, says son Tejashwi Yadav will not quit as Bihar Deputy CM","Lalu Prasad said his son Tejashwi Yadav, who is facing corruption charges, will not resign as Bihar Deputy Chief Minister. (ANI)
Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav on Friday said that his son Tejashwi Yadav, who is facing corruption charges, will not resign as Bihar Deputy Chief Minister. “The Vidhan Mandal of our party has taken a decision that Tejashwi Yadav will not resign,” Lalu told ANI in an exclusive conversation. “An FIR is not sufficient reason for the resignation,” he added. This assertion from the RJD chief thus brought an end to speculations that Tejashwi Yadav might step down from the post to save the ruling alliance. The RJD chief further said that he and his family have already issued their clarification on the corruption charges that have been filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). “Whatever accusations have been made against me and my family, we have already issued a clarification in the press conference. We will give our responses to the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate whenever they call us,” said Lalu.
The current crisis was sparked by the CBI raids last week on Lalu’s residence and cases filed against him, Tejashwi and others in an alleged land-for-hotels scandal. Since then, the two parties have directed barbs at each other, increasing pressure on chief minister Nitish Kumar to sack Tejashwi to protect an image of clean governance. Earlier last week, the CBI registered a corruption case against Lalu, his wife Rabri Devi, son Tejaswi; former Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) Managing Director P.K. Goyal; and the wife of Lalu’s confidante Prem Chand Gupta, Sujata on allegations of awarding the tender for development, maintenance and operation of hotels in Ranchi and Puri in 2006.
The CBI later questioned Rabri Devi and Tejashwi. The case was registered on the allegations of awarding the tender for development, maintenance and operation of Hotels at Ranchi and Puri to a Private Company dealing with Hotels in the year 2006. The investigative agency also conducted searches at 12 locations across Patna, Delhi, Gurugram and other places. The RJD supremo, however, refuted the allegations against him and called it a political conspiracy hatched by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",Financial Express,0

WHERE DOES MILITARY READINESS FIT INTO THIS NEW SOCIAL AGENDA?
Center for Military Readiness President Elaine Donnelly said “this is a terrible decision for military readiness. For the Department of Defense to focus on a tiny, tiny, minority and disregard the concerns of the majority of people in the armed forces is more than irresponsible,” Donnelly said.
The military exists to defend America PERIOD. The military does NOT exist to push a social or political agenda. You cannot mandate military leaders to deny reality. You cannot teach subordinates to deny reality, especially when dealing with sexual privacy, without NEGATIVE consequences.

If recent history is any guide, the next step is FORCED indoctrination, which will run rampant throughout the entire military community.
“Military leaders are being ordered to adopt this policy, to promote it, to conduct education classes, even down to the Department of Defense elementary schools – the largest school system in the world. Everybody in the armed forces will be indoctrinated to talk about gender dysphoria as if it is a normal condition and as if they are a civil rights group,” according to Donnelly.
BOOT CAMP IS TURNING INTO RE-EDUCATION CAMP
This transgender activism would FORCE soldiers to ignore what their eyes, ears & brains tell them, and fall into line behind this new fantasyland. This would require soldiers to be more concerned about “offending” a self-absorbed comrade, than in getting the mission accomplished.
And, yes, those who refuse to pretend transgenderism helps military readiness can kiss their own military careers goodbye. Why is Mattis caving to this special interest group’s demands?

President Donald Trump vowed Monday to boost U.S. manufacturing by cutting the $64 billion trade deficit with Mexico as he showcased products made in all 50 states — everything from a fire truck to a baseball bat.
""No longer are we going to allow other countries to break the rules, to steal our jobs and drain our wealth,"" Trump said at a White House event that spilled from the East Room to the South Lawn.
Shortly after Trump's remarks, the U.S. trade representative released an 18-page report about its goals for updating the decades-old North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. In addition to reducing the trade deficit, the administration wants to insert a chapter on the digital economy into the deal. It also wants to strengthen labor and environmental obligations, as well as amending the rules of origin so that more of the products traded come from the United States and North America.
Facing an investigation into his campaign's ties with Russia and a tax and health care agenda struggling to make headway as quickly as promised, Trump is turning his focus to trade this week. Administration officials are to meet Wednesday with economic officials from China, a nation the president has accused of dumping steel on the global market to hurt U.S. steelmakers. The White House emphasis on trade follows a string of other recent theme weeks on energy, job-training and infrastructure that mostly failed to draw much attention away from the Russia inquiry.
The president took his time checking out products from all over the country: Trump donned a cowboy hat from Texas. He swung a baseball bat from Louisiana. And he even climbed into the cab of a Wisconsin-built fire truck and pretended to be a firefighter, saying, ""Where's the fire? Where's the fire? Put it out fast!""
The new NAFTA objectives, a requirement to begin talks on updating the agreement in the next 30 days, contain the first specifics for a Trump administration that has made bold promises on trade. Trump has pledged to recover factory jobs and boost wages by crafting new trade deals. Supporters note that NAFTA enabled companies to charge cheaper prices for products that range from cars to vacuum cleaners, helping many U.S. consumers.
The president said he only seeks a level playing field for U.S. companies and workers, but ""if the playing field was slanted a little bit toward us, I would accept that, also.""
But the president has a conflicted relationship with global trade. His namesake clothing business depended on the work of low-wage workers living overseas, as does the fashion line of his daughter and White House aide, Ivanka Trump.
As of now, Ivanka Trump's firm continues to have its products made overseas. Her lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, said in a statement Monday that the president's daughter ""has resigned from the company, does not control its operations, and has been advised that she cannot ask the government to act in an issue involving the brand in any way, constraining her ability to intervene personally.""
Trump has blasted trade deficits as hampering the economy by sending money abroad. But the trade deficit has actually improved from $762 billion in 2006 to $505 billion last year, a change brought about largely because U.S. consumers cut back spending during the Great Recession. His administration already is pursuing multiple trade cases on individual products and is weighing whether to impose tariffs and quotas on foreign steel in hopes of curbing production in China, even though that country represents a fraction of U.S. steel imports.
The Mexican government said in a statement that the administration's NAFTA objectives will give greater clarity to the negotiations.
Chrystia Freeland, Canada's minister of foreign affairs, said, ""NAFTA supports millions of middle class jobs"" across North America and Canada welcomes the opportunity to add ""progressive, free and fair approaches"" to the pact.
Despite the report, it's still not clear exactly how Trump will renegotiate NAFTA to reduce the trade deficit, said Phil Levy, a senior fellow for the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and a business professor at Northwestern University.
""There's no detail,"" Levy said. ""There's nothing in there where you could say, this is how we get rid of the trade deficit.""
When NAFTA went into effect in 1994, the United States ran a small trade surplus in goods with Mexico and a slight deficit with Canada. But the size of the deficits steadily began to increase afterward.
By last year, the United States ran a $64 billion trade deficit with Mexico and a nearly $11 billion gap with Canada. Neither trade deficit is near its peak level. The trade deficit with Canada hit a high in 2008, while the trade gap with Mexico nearly reached $75 billion in 2007.

UK Journalist Reveals Europe Is Way More Pro-Trump Than You Think and His Popularity Is Growing,"admin News, Politics, U.SLeave a comment
Another liberal media narrative busted.
It seems President Trump’s ideas are more widely accepted by Europeans than is generally portrayed and reported here in the U.S., according to one U.K. journalist.
“There is so much more sympathy for Trump ideas than you would guess from listening to the debates among the European political elites,” columnist for The Telegraph, Fraser Nelson, told Fox News’ Dana Perino on Friday.
Though Trump is often portrayed as a “crazy” guy with “out there” ideas, Nelson noted, it is European leaders, not the public, who are “traumatized” by the president and his administration.
“It’s certainly true that a lot of European leaders are kind of traumatized by what they are hearing coming out of the White House,” he said. “But for the public, it’s a very different opinion.”
Nelson made the point in a recent column for the Telegraph as well.
“Many EU (European Union) leaders are coming around to Mr. Trump’s way of thinking … in many areas, European popular opinion is firmly on his side,” he wrote:
Trump’s views may appal Europe’s leaders, but they’re mainstream amongst the European public. My @telegraph column: https://t.co/5aQPwdXdnG
— Fraser Nelson (@FraserNelson) July 7, 2017
“There is so much more sympathy for Trump ideas than you would guess from listening to the debates among the European political elites,” the editor of Spectator magazine told Perino, citing a survey showing that many Europeans actually favor a ban on immigration from Muslim countries.
Nelson admitted that Trump is an “unconvincing ambassador of American values” because his style is different from what Europeans are used to. However, he does believe that European politicians tend to agree with the president’s general ideas, like dialing back the overreach of globalism.
Europeans who agree with Trump “tend not to be the ones that protest outside G-20 meetings,” Fraser said. “That’s not quite their style.”
“The kind of coalition that brought Donald Trump to power in America certainly can be seen all over Europe, mainly behind a lot of the populist movements whose popularity is doing really well right now,” he added.",Nevo News,1
BREAKING: Terrorist ARRESTED In California,"Huny Badger AMERICA’S FREEDOM FIGHTERS –
California authorities announced Wednesday that they arrested a prominent San Francisco Bay Area anti-fascist leader on charges stemming from a state Capitol brawl last year between white nationalist groups and counter-protesters.
Yvonne C. Felarca, 47, was arrested Tuesday in Los Angeles on charges of inciting and participating in a riot and assault likely to cause great bodily injury, the Sacramento County District Attorney’s Office said.
Yvette Felarca is the name used by the leader and spokeswoman for the group By Any Means Necessary, but public records show her given name is Yvonne Capistrano Felarca, Breitbart reports.
At the time, Breitbart News reported:
Seven people were sent to the hospital with stab wounds, two with life-threatening injuries, on Sunday afternoon as Black Bloc anarchists attacked and fought with white supremacist groups outside the state Capitol in Sacramento.
Several other demonstrators who managed to avoid the hospital suffered bruises after the groups engaged in a chaotic melee.
The Black Bloc activists were part of a militant leftist “anti-fascist” group,”Antifa Sacramento.” The right-wing extremists were members of the Traditionalist Worker Party and the Golden State Skinheads, and were holding a permitted rally.
Members of “anti-fascist” groups like the ones who attacked protestors [sic] have also been been responsible for a number of attacks around the country, including attacks on Donald Trump supporters at recent rallies. Some of these attacks follow hyperbolic allegations by some on the left (and even some on the right, such as Glenn Beck) that Donald Trump is “Hitler.”
By Any Means Necessary has not returned repeated telephone messages from The Associated Press over two days.
A second counter-protester, Michael Williams, 56, was arrested Wednesday in Yolo County on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and participating in a riot.
They are the last of four arrests stemming from a June 2016 melee that erupted when more than 300 counter-protesters confronted about 30 members of the Traditionalist Worker Party. Prosecutors on Tuesday announced the arrests of a party supporter and another counter-protester.
Felarca attended the Capitol protest and gave television interviews after the melee. Following those interviews, Berkeley police last year investigated threats against Berkeley’s Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School where Felarca was a teacher. School officials could not be reached Wednesday.
She also has been prominent at several clashes in Berkeley involving the Occupy movement and more recently between supporters and opponents of President Donald Trump and conservative leaders.
Prosecutors said there are no more outstanding warrants from last year’s clash, although the California Highway Patrol had sought charges against 101 participants after an eight-month investigation. The district attorney’s office said many counter-protesters were masked, making it difficult to bring charges including against those involved in several stabbings and an assault on a Sacramento television station’s news crew.
Fourteen people had stab wounds, cuts and bruises, with two of the injured surviving critical stab wounds.
The district attorney’s office also rejected dozens of lesser charges including unlawful assembly or possessing illegal signs and banners.
“Our role is to investigate the incident and make recommendations to the district attorney’s office,” highway patrol spokeswoman Fran Clader said Wednesday. “Ultimately it’s up to the district attorney’s office to determine who should be arrested and face charges.”

Chinese doctors scramble to ‘rescue’ ailing Nobel laureate,"Beijing – A Chinese hospital said Tuesday it was scrambling to save terminally-ill Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, while human rights groups decried his treatment by the authorities and the leak of a video showing him in his sickbed.
The health of the prominent 61-year-old democracy advocate has deteriorated since authorities revealed last month that he had been transferred from prison to a hospital due to late-stage liver cancer.
But Chinese officials have ignored calls by international human rights groups, Western governments and local activists to grant Liu’s wish to be treated abroad, raising fears he will die without having tasted freedom.
A day after reporting that Liu was in a critical condition, the First Hospital of China Medical University in the northeastern city of Shenyang said on Tuesday that the patient was “still in active rescue”.
Liu has an abdominal infection, organ dysfunction and he went into septic shock, the hospital said in a statement on its website. He is undergoing kidney dialysis, and is getting anti-infection and organ function support therapy.

Now Under the Nazarbayev Brand: Astana’s Airport,"Now Under the Nazarbayev Brand: Astana's Airport
Kazakhstan renamed Astana’s international airport after the first and current president of the country, Nursultan Nazarbayev.
With a government decree, Kazakhstan’s Astana International Airport was renamed after Nursultan Nazarbayev, the country’s president since independence, in a move that confirms common perceptions of an unwavering cult of personality.
While naming airports and other national landmarks after president is not uncommon – from JFK in New York to Charles De Gaulle in Paris – giving one the name of a sitting president is undoubtedly rarer. Even in Uzbekistan, where former President Islam Karimov cultivated his own personality cult, the government gave the airport in Tashkent Karimov’s name only in January 2017, a few months after his death. When airports are dedicated to people still active in their profession – as it happened with footballer Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport in Madeira, Portugal – analysts often question the decisions as premature.
In this case, the decision was welcomed by several politicians who somewhat represent Nazarbayev’s “fan base.” They call him “Yelbasy,” father of the nation, with endearment and would rename anything in his honor, if possible.

Bakytgul Khamenova, MP for the ruling Nur Otan party, said she will continue to lobby for renaming Astana after Nazarbayev. In 1997, when it became the country’s capital, the government changed the name of the city from Tselinograd to Astana, “capital” in Kazakh. Locals often speculate that the generic name could just be a placeholder and that the city will be renamed after Nazarbayev once he is no longer in power.
In the meantime, however, the number of applications of the Nazarbayev brand to institutions and landmarks is surpassing the rumors circulating on social media and on the streets over the past few years.
Soon after it was opened in 2009, the New University of Astana was renamed Nazarbayev University. A network of elite-grade schools was also established under the name Nazarbayev Intellectual Schools. In celebration of Kazakhstan’s 25th year of independence, the Central Bank printed a limited edition 10,000 tenge banknote featuring Nazarbayev’s portrait. Since July 2010, residents of Almaty, the former capital, can take a stroll in the Park of the First President, which features a large statue of Nazarbayev. Despite the president’s repeated declarations that such showings of reverence are excessive, his closest circle continues to crown him with laurels.
The idea of dedicating the Astana airport to Nazarbayev was lodged in 2009, followed by a public survey ordered by the Senate. Nazarbayev’s resistance to this latest accolade seems to have finally given in. As if foreseeing a scolding from above, Dauren Abayev, minister for information and communication, said he hoped “that the president would understand this as a celebration of his legacy for the improvement of Kazakhstan’s infrastructure.”
In a similar tone, Yerlan Karin, a political analyst recently appointed head of Kazakhstan TV, said the decision could find a rationale in the president’s recent policies to improve infrastructure in the country.
“It is a logical move because our president was behind “Nurly Zhol,” one of the most successful government program for the development of transport infrastructure,” he told local media.
Asked about the news of the airport’s new name, a local NGO worker in Almaty who often travels to Astana Airport said the change is unlikely to affect anyone in Kazakhstan, as long as services continue to improve.
“I don’t care about the name of the airport, I care about its services, its facilities and its connections. Naming it after the president highlights once again the cult of personality that permeates Astana, but I think this is a non-issue for local everyday users of the hub, as long as standards are kept high,” she told  .
Importantly, the decision to rename the airport came from a government decree and is independent from the private company Astana International Airport that manages the hub. Furthermore, the airport is likely to retain its International Air Transport Association (IATA) code, TSE, which will continue to remind passengers that, after all, there are no permanent names in Kazakhstan’s never-ending transition.",The Diplomat,0
The Whole Trump Versus “Morning Joe” Flap Feels Like A Massive Gimmick,"So are the American people getting played?
One could make that argument, if they study the way things have rolled out, that, indeed, this is a massive work, meant for ratings.
Specifically, President Trump is tossing his old pals, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski a bone for their show, “Morning Joe.”
Let’s examine what we know.
To begin with, Scarborough and Brzezinski haven’t always been so critical of Trump. They, like every other network, couldn’t cover him enough in the lead up to the election.
During the primary, they treated him as if he were already president.
This behavior went on beyond the election, and for whatever shock there may have been when Trump walked away with the win, it wasn’t such a shock that Scarborough and Brzezinski were unwilling to spend New Year’s Eve at Trump’s private Palm Beach resort, Mar-a-Lago.
Lawsuit Demands Do Over in GA6
They could have gone anywhere, presumably, but they chose to hang out with Trump – the same man they’re “feuding” with, now.
Somewhere along the way, things devolved and both sides began taking shots.
And it makes for great TV.
After Trump’s hateful attack on Scarborough, and particularly Brzezinski last week, the MSNBC co-hosts cancelled a holiday vacation to address the Twitter attack on their Friday show.
According to the Associated Press, it was a savvy move, as it gave them a ratings record.
The Nielsen company said Wednesday that 1.66 million people watched the MSNBC morning show the day after the tweets. That narrowly beat the show’s previous record, which came the day after Trump was elected last year.
Trump, in denouncing the show last week, wrote that Brzezinski was “bleeding badly from a facelift” when he saw them around the New Year.
Friday’s “Morning Joe” proved more popular than Trump’s favorite morning show, “Fox & Friends.” Even Trump tweeted that he watched “Morning Joe” on Friday.
So why did he watch?
I’ve been told I overthink things, and that may be true. I believe very strongly in giving attention to the fine details.
They loved him. They hated him. He hated them back, to the point that he launches an attack that was pointless and made no sense to anyone. They plan a dramatic segment to address the issue, and they get record ratings.
Meanwhile, Trump is being heralded a hero by his loyalists, even as he does his part to add to their ratings by watching, himself.
I’ve watched enough WWE (WCW was better) to know about the whole “heel” versus “face” dynamic.
Don’t believe that’s what’s going on?
Then why did CNN just run in with a folding chair?

"Trey Gowdy Goes Nuclear, Exposed The DNC’s Deepest Darkest Secret – No One Expected This!","Try not to give the southern appeal a chance to trick you, Congressman Trey Gowdy isn’t pulling any punches on his voter paid time in Washington. Gowdy’s prosecutorial foundation is appearing through in how he’s making inquiries on the floor of Congress.
The thing on the docket that stood out enough to be noticed most as of late was the thinking behind the DNC not turning over it’s hacked PC servers to be investigated and shielded from additionally hurt by an administration office. Gowdy, as with the vast majority of us, noticed a rodent, and he’s incorrigibly disposed to get it.
While he uninhibitedly concedes that it’s theory, I think his figure would most likely be right on target. There are just a couple of conceivable clarifications for what’s new with a political party who’s frantic to shield its mysteries from getting out to the legislature, notwithstanding when it’s as of now been hacked by the private division.
I assume the issue of lethal dependably needs to come up when we’re discussing the DNC, however, I think the break in rationale there is the way the email server issue got poisonous in any case. Anything ends up plainly lethal when you blend harm in, which is the thing that their mate Hillary did when she gambled lives to fill her heart with joy somewhat more helpful.
What’s more, for the record, something must be restrictive if the work contained on it is possessed by them. Furthermore, since the data on those servers ought to be claimed by the DNC’s supervisors (otherwise known as, the American individuals) as they’d say in Gowdy’s home state; sorry, however, that puppy won’t chase. Unless obviously, they had something else on it, not to do with their work for the American individuals, or demonstrating they were truly working for somebody other than the general population.
There are a couple of conceivable clarifications for their hesitance to get help in investigating this specialized trouble. None of them prompt a decent consummation for them on the off chance that we get some answers concerning it.

Trump Attacks Federal Law Enforcement With a Blunt Force Instrument,"President Donald Trump on Tuesday issued a stunning vote of no confidence in basically everyone currently in a leadership position in the Justice Department, the FBI, and the special counsel’s office — in other words, not just some federal law enforcement, but all of it. The president’s rebuke came in a lengthy interview with the New York Times on Tuesday, reaching everyone from the attorney general to staff attorneys hired by Robert Mueller — whose investigation he pointedly did not promise not to terminate. His complaint? They’re all, in different ways, not serving him. And serving him, he made clear, is their real job.
It’s a chilling interview — chilling because of the portrait it paints of presidential paranoia, chilling for its monomaniacal view of the relationship between the president and law enforcement, and chilling for what it says about Trump’s potential readiness to interfere with the Mueller investigation.
If Attorney General Jeff Sessions does not resign today, it will reflect nothing more or less than a lack of self-respect on his part — a willingness to hold office even with the overt disdain of the president of the United States, at whose pleasure he serves, nakedly on the record.
The president is evidently distraught at Sessions’s recusal from the Russia investigation “right after he gets the job.” (Sessions recused himself on March 2 — three weeks after his swearing in and fifteen weeks after his nomination.) The attorney general gave the president “zero” heads up, Trump said. In Trump’s view: “Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job, and I would have picked somebody else.” He twice described Sessions’s decision as “unfair to the president,” seemingly unaware that his recusal was almost surely compelled by Justice Department recusal rules. That is, the president is openly expressing bitterness toward his attorney general for following the rules — because the rules don’t favor Trump’s interests. He wants an attorney general who will actively supervise the Justice Department, and the Russia investigation, in a fashion congenial to his interests, and he has no compunction about saying so explicitly. He makes perfectly clear that he regrets appointing Sessions. He makes equally clear that Sessions’s job is, in his mind, a personal service contract to him, and that if Sessions couldn’t deliver on service to Trump, he shouldn’t have taken the position.
To add insult to injury, Trump also heaps scorn on the then-nominee’s inability to give satisfactory answers during his confirmation hearing about his meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak — on which he blames the recusal. “Sessions gave some bad answers,” he said. The president continued: “He gave some answers that were simple questions and should have been simple answers, but they weren’t. He then becomes attorney general, and he then announces he’s going to recuse himself. Why wouldn’t he have told me that before?”
Sessions has hardly shrouded himself in glory over the past few months, but it is wildly improper for the president to talk about the attorney general in this fashion. The attorney general serves at his pleasure. If he is dissatisfied with Sessions’s performance, Trump can remove him. Unlike the FBI director, Sessions does not have a ten-year term that creates some normative expectation of retention. It would be, of course, inappropriate to fire the attorney general for having the temerity to follow Justice Department recusal policies on the advice of career lawyers, but it’s also inappropriate to whine publicly about his conduct without removing him. For those who need a reminder, the proper thing for a president to say publicly about a recusal in a live investigative matter — one that involves him directly and personally — is nothing whatsoever.
But Trump was just getting started in his attacks on federal law enforcement with his comments about Sessions. Moving down the Justice Department chain of command, the president was also cool toward Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, describing Sessions’ recusal as causing the president to “end up with a second man.” He distanced Rosenstein from both himself and Sessions: He declared, “Jeff hardly knew” Rosenstein and characterized Rosenstein as “from Baltimore,” before noting, “There are very few Republicans in Baltimore, if any.” (Rosenstein did work in Baltimore in his capacity as the U.S. attorney for Maryland, but he grew up in Pennsylvania.)
Trump’s beef with Rosenstein is, of course, the deputy attorney general’s appointment of Mueller as special counsel. He points to “conflicts” in Rosenstein’s role: that Rosenstein both recommended former FBI Director James Comey’s firing and now is “involved in the case.” This frustration seems to be long-running: Trump made a similar point on Twitter last month, writing, “I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director!” While Trump has previously admitted that Rosenstein’s memo criticizing Comey was pretextual and that the president would have dismissed the FBI director regardless, on Wednesday he hedged, saying, “Now, perhaps I would have fired Comey anyway, and it certainly didn’t hurt to have the letter, O.K.”
Then there’s Mueller himself. The president declared bluntly, “I have done nothing wrong. A special counsel should never have been appointed in this case.” And he regards Mueller as conflicted because he was briefly considered to replace Comey.
Trump described his meeting with Mueller while interviewing him for the job of FBI director as “wonderful” and said, “of course … he wanted the job.” And he seems to regard this as some kind of conflict of interest on Mueller’s part. Trump does not seem to understand or even be able to imagine that Mueller might have been talking to him out of a sense of public service, not personal interest, with respect to an agency he had led for a long time and treasures and which Trump had plunged into crisis.
“Talk about conflicts? But he was interviewing for the job.” Trump also hinted at knowledge of additional, as-yet-unreported conflicts on Mueller’s part, stating, “There were many other conflicts that I haven’t said, but I will at some point.” Following his appointment as special counsel, ethics officials at the Justice Department declared Mueller free of conflicts on the matter of his prior work with WilmerHale, which also employs counsel for Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior advisor, Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter a senior advisor, and Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager.
Nor did the president stop at Mueller personally. He also went after his staff. In response to a question about whether he would consider dismissing Mueller, he declares, “Look, there are so many conflicts that everybody has.” Previously, the president has alleged that other members of the Mueller’s staff have conflicts of interest, stating last month on Fox & Friends that “the people that have been hired are all Hillary Clinton supporters, some of them worked for Hillary Clinton.” At least three members of the special counsel’s team have given money to Democrats and two gave the legal maximum to Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, though Mueller himself was a registered Republican at the time of his FBI directorship and has been widely described as apolitical.
And to top it off, the president apparently feels no compunction either about commenting on the proper scope of Mueller’s investigation substantively. When asked whether a potential investigation of the Trump family finances “unrelated to Russia” would constitute a “red line” in the investigation, Trump stated, “I think that’s a violation.” And he did not say no when asked whether such conduct would lead him to fire Mueller; rather, he hedged, stating that “I can’t answer that question because I don’t think it’s going to happen.”
Trump still wasn’t done. It’s not just the special counsel investigating him, his staff, the attorney general, and the deputy attorney general with whom the president of the United States has a beef. It’s also the FBI leadership — or that part of it, anyway, that he hasn’t already fired.
Trump is sharply critical of Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe on the grounds that McCabe’s wife received money from political organizations connected to Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, in support of her 2015 campaign for Virginia state Senate. The president used this connection to suggest some partisan bias on McCabe’s part: “We have a director of the F.B.I., acting, who received $700,000, whose wife received $700,000 from, essentially, Hillary Clinton. ’Cause it was through Terry [McAuliffe]. Which is Hillary Clinton.”
The president’s point is somewhat unclear here, as he then jumps to a condemnation of Clinton’s conduct related to the FBI investigation into her private email server. But this is not the first time that he has used this line of attack against McCabe. In Comey’s written statement provided to the Senate Intelligence Committee before his testimony, he described a phone conversation in which the president informed Comey that “he hadn’t brought up ‘the McCabe thing’ because I had said McCabe [then Comey’s deputy] was honorable, although McAuliffe was close to the Clintons and had given him (I think he meant Deputy Director McCabe’s wife) campaign money.” Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-I.A.) voiced a similar criticism of McCabe during the confirmation hearing for Christopher Wray as FBI director.
If, on reading this, it sounds like the president believes that law enforcement should be at his personal beck and call, that’s because that is, in fact, exactly what he believes. We know this because he made this belief perfectly clear in the interview as well. At one point, he offered an extraordinary account of the history of the FBI and its relationship to the Justice Department. He indicated that around the time of the Nixon administration, “out of courtesy, the F.B.I. started reporting to the Department of Justice.” He continued: “But there was nothing official, there was nothing from Congress. There was nothing — anything. But the FBI person really reports directly to the president of the United States, which is interesting. You know, which is interesting.”
Trump’s logic isn’t easy to follow here, but his core claim is unmistakeable — and “interesting” is a generous word for it: the FBI director serves the president. As a matter of constitutional hierarchy, this is of course true. But in investigative matters, the FBI director does not, or should not, serve the president by reporting to him. He serves the president by leading law enforcement in an independent and apolitical fashion. And it is fundamentally corrupt for any president to be asking him to do otherwise.
As for the convoluted rationale he uses to get to this corruption, well, suffice it to say that Trump’s suggestion that the FBI voluntarily began reporting to the Justice Department around the Nixon era betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of the wave of critical FBI reforms during that time. These were implemented shortly after Watergate and other scandals brought to light the FBI’s abusive and unlawful activities during the 48-year reign of Director J. Edgar Hoover.
Those reforms were, of course, designed to preclude exactly the kind of power relationship to which Trump now lays claim. In a foundational 1978 speech that has shaped subsequent Department policy, fromer President Jimmy Carter’s attorney general, Griffin Bell, affirmed the independence of the Justice Department and its constituent entities, including the FBI. Bell declared, “it is improper for any Member of Congress, any member of the White House staff, or anyone else, to attempt to influence anyone in the Justice Department with respect to a particular litigation decision, except by legal argument or the provision of relevant facts.”
The astonishing implication of Trump’s view is that he believes the president may shut down an FBI investigation that displeases him. Indeed, Trump went so far as to say that too: When explaining why it would not be a problem even if he had told Comey to drop the investigation Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security advisor, he stated, “other people go a step further. I could have ended that whole thing just by saying—they say it can’t be obstruction because you can say: ‘It’s ended. It’s over. Period.’”
In an environment in which the president of the United States, in a single interview, expresses no-confidence in the attorney general, the deputy attorney general, the special counsel, the acting FBI director, and the special counsel’s staff, and in which he makes clear that the FBI should be his personal force and that all of law enforcement should be about serving him, the principle protection is having people with backbone who are willing to do their jobs and stand up for one another in the elevation of their oaths of office over political survival.
Unfortunately, the signs are not particularly encouraging on this front. Even as the president was attacking him in an interview with the New York Times, Rosenstein was busy giving an interview to Fox News that won’t reassure anyone on Mueller’s staff that the acting attorney general is the man with whom to share a foxhole. After confirming that he stands by his recommendation to fire Comey and clucking about the confidentiality of memos, Rosenstein gave a lukewarm response to questions about Mueller’s staff. While Rosenstein defended his decision to appoint Mueller, he did not splash cold water on the notion that his staff may be compromised by political contributions. In response to Fox anchor Martha MacCallum’s insinuation that “some of the attorneys he has hired … have made donations to the Clinton campaign” and a question about whether this “bother[s]” him, Rosenstein passed up the chance to express confidence in a staff that ultimately reports to him. Instead, gave this ominously puzzling answer: “The Department of Justice, we judge by results. And so my view about that is, we’ll see if they do the right thing.”
We are in a dangerous moment — one in which the president, with his infinite sense of grievance, feels entitled publicly to attack the entire federal law enforcement apparatus, and that apparatus, in turn, lacks a single person with the stature, the institutional position, and the fortitude to stand up to him. Sessions has not done so. While Rosenstein did the country an enormous service when he appointed Mueller, he acted as an enabler of the Comey firing in the first instance and did not do himself credit yesterday. Mueller certainly has the stature, but by the nature of his position he cannot say anything publicly; he is investigating the president and thus cannot also confront him. And McCabe, who has been both able and courageous in the aftermath of Comey’s firing, is in an acting capacity.
The man who had the stature, the institutional position, and the moral fiber to confront the President on such matters was Comey, who is no longer there and whom the president also slimed in his interview yesterday.
The result is an environment in which the president can say these things without obvious consequence, at least for now. Rosenstein or Sessions could change that today. If they were willing to be touched by greatness even for a moment, they would resign together with a strong statement in defense of the integrity of federal law enforcement, the men and women who carry it out, and the processes under which they work. That’s what people with honor would do in this situation.

Faking an emergency phone call to get out of an unpleasant situation is so overused it has become a cliche. But apparently not even the family of the president is above doing it.
In an 11-page document to the Associated Press, Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Donald Trump, denied any collusion with Russia. Kushner was one of several people who during the campaign met with a Russian lawyer who promised damaging information from the Russian government on Hillary Clinton, according to emails released by Donald Trump Jr.
Kushner is supposed to give his statement in a closed-door meeting with the Senate Intelligence Committee on Monday.
Those involved said the meeting actually focused on the topic of Russian adoption and no information on Clinton was disclosed. Rob Goldstone, who helped organize the meeting, described it as “inane nonsense.”
Kushner took that a step further in his statement Monday, not only saying the meeting was a “waste of our time,” but also that he emailed his assistant during the meeting to help him get out of it.
“Reviewing emails recently confirmed my memory that the meeting was a waste of our time and that, in looking for a polite way to leave and get back to my work, I actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after I had been there for 10 or so minutes and wrote, ‘Can u pls call me on my cell? Need excuse to get out of meeting,’” Kushner said.

From Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to former campaign director Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump's allies have business and personal connections to Russia. As Congress and the FBI look into Russia's involvement with the 2016 election, those connections are increasingly under a microscope.

Kushner did not say if the aide actually did call him in the document.
The revelation – one of a few in the document – had some people wondering how Kushner would handle brokering peace in the Middle East – one of his many jobs in the Trump administration – if he couldn’t simply excuse himself from a meeting.
Because he's such a baby he can't stand up and walk out? This is the guy who's going to brunt peace to the middle East?

The guy who is going to solve the crisis in the Middle East needs his assistant to make up an excuse to get him out of a meeting. Very cool.
— Matt Epstein (@mjeps) July 24, 2017
Many others were skeptical of Kushner’s implication that he had not known what the meeting was supposed to be about prior to attending it.
“That email was on top of a long back and forth that I did not read at the time. As I did with most emails when I was working remotely, I quickly reviewed on my iPhone the relevant message that the meeting would occur at 4:00 PM at his office,” Kushner wrote. “Documents confirm my memory that this was calendared as ‘Meeting: Don Jr. | Jared Kushner.’ No one else was mentioned.”
Some people on Twitter were quick to point out that Kushner wouldn’t have needed to read the full email chain, as the subject line was: “FW: Russia – Clinton – private and confidential.”

"Game of Thrones, season 7, episode 1: Dragonstone review - bloodiest show on TV can still shock and surprise","Emilia Clarke as Daenerys and Jacob Anderson as Grey Worm in Game of Thrones
18 July 2017 • 1:33am
How much simpler the world seemed back in June 2016, when the sixth season of Game of Thrones was drawing to a close. After 13 months of real-world political bombshells and power shifts, and the rise of a would-be dynasty who will seemingly stop at nothing to gain and hold onto power, one might wonder whether the biggest, bloodiest, most Dragon-heavy show on television would still have the ability to shock and surprise. The answer, happily, is yes.
Originally adapted from George R R Martin’s series of books, A Song of Ice and Fire, the source material was spent by season five, and even the most ardent fans no longer know which direction the series, now its own entirely original story, will take.
The seventh season of HBO’s epic fantasy kicks off with what, at first, would seem to be a flashback. Grizzled, gout-raddled old Walder Frey (David Bradley) is congratulating his men on their nifty work in mass murder at the Red Wedding of season three, and rewarding them with a feast.
We know that Frey is dead now, his throat slit last season by Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) after she’d fed him a meat pie made of his own two sons, and it quickly becomes clear that this isn’t a flashback at all, but, instead, a Jonestown-style massacre, the assembled Freys choking to death on poisoned flagons of wine.

Having graduated from her gruelling internship with the Faceless Men, Arya is now unstoppable in her quest to avenge her family. And as she later reveals to a singing soldier – a slightly comedic cameo by the musical guest star, Ed Sheeran – she’s heading not North to Winterfell, but South to King’s Landing, ‘to kill the Queen’.
With just 13 episodes to go, spread across two seasons, there has been much talk of an increase in pace in this penultimate season, and a rapid ramping up of tension. However, though lush and cinematic as ever, this opening episode features no battles, no large set-pieces of the sort the show has become renowned for, but primarily sets the scene, with competing Houses and their armies all finally converging on Westeros to slug it out for the Iron Throne.
It would, in fairness, have been tough to maintain the momentum or the body count of the final two climactic episodes of season six - the Battle of the Bastards, a slaughter on a Somme-like scale, and the explosive season finale, in which Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) blew up the Great Sept of Baelor, wiping out 11 regular cast members in the process.
Lena Headey as Cersei LannisterCredit:HBO
Having subsequently claimed the Iron Throne for herself, she’s commissioned a new decorative floor in her King’s Landing courtyard, an enormous painted map of her empire, like a game of Giant Risk. It takes her brother/lover Jaime (Nicolaj Coster-Waldau), to point out that she’s not quite Queen of the Seven Kingdoms yet (‘three, at best’) – and to sound a note of caution: she has no allies.
But Cersei, as ever, has a few irons in the fire: first up, the deliciously mad Euron Greyjoy (Pilou Asbeak), hell-bent on murdering his niece and nephew, who have defected to support Danaerys, and attempting to woo Cersei with brags about his massive fleet.
Sibling tension is also bubbling up in the North, where Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and his half-sister Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) are ruling Winterfell, having liberated their family home from Ramsay Bolton. Jon is adapting to the role of King quite easily, but adjusting to Sansa’s newfound position at his right hand less well. The current power-sharing agreement looks uncertain to last long, particularly with the Machiavellian Littlefinger (Aidan Gillan) whispering foul nothings in Sansa’s ear.
There are new faces, including Jim Broadbent as the Archmaester Marwyn, who is training Samwell Tarly (John Bradley) at the Citadel, and the welcome return of Jorah (Iain Glen), though he’s apparently not yet found the cure for his nasty case of greyscale.
But one might expect an episode called Dragonstone to belong predominantly to Daenerys (Emilia Clarke). And we do, eventually, witness her, having finally crossed the Narrow Sea with her trio of dragons, thousands-strong fleet, and her loyal entourage, including an unusually silent Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage), landing at the imposing ancestral home of House Targaryan, a great grey Hogwarty pile.
While the Mother of Dragons is looking more regal (and more covered-up) than ever, Dragonstone itself is in need of a little TLC. But when she runs her fingers along the vast dust-covered Painted Table, carved in the shape of Westeros, and declares ‘Shall we begin?’, she’s definitely not talking about the housework.

"North Korea Conducts Nuclear Missile Test That Could Hit New York, Denver or Chicago [VIDEO]","North Korea successfully launched yet another Intercontinental Ballistic Missile yesterday that is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. Once again it crashed into the Sea of Japan, unnervingly close to Japan itself. The difference with this ICBM is experts say it has the capability of not only hitting Alaska, Hawaii and the west coast… it can also hit any major city in the US, including New York, Chicago and Denver. Kim Jong-Un called it a stern warning to the US and this time I agree with him. We need to do more than talk tough on TV and soon or this madman is going to try and kill a whole bunch of Americans.
Those that keep saying that North Korea would never do this because they know we would annihilate them are sorely mistaken. You cannot negotiate with an insane dictator. Time has run out for us to be blase about all this. Experts yesterday said that North Korea’s technology had progressed far faster than they thought it would. You can thank the Iranians, the Russians and the Chinese for that. The Chinese know something is coming. They are moving even more troops and armaments to the border with the Hermit Kingdom and we are doing pretty much nothing. Although, I am hearing our military is considering a response this fall. Wonder if we have that long now.
From the Daily Mail:
Kim Jong-un has issued a ‘stern warning’ to the US after experts claim he now has the capability to hit New York, Los Angeles and Chicago with nuclear missiles.
The North Korean leader said Saturday the second flight test of an intercontinental ballistic missile on Friday demonstrated his country can hit the US mainland.
Had it been fired at a standard trajectory, the rocket could have reached Los Angeles, Denver and Chicago and would have even had New York and Boston within its sights, according to analysts.
Kim expressed ‘great satisfaction’ after the Hwasong-14 missile reached a height of 2,314 miles and traveled 620 miles before accurately landing in waters off Japan.
The test was aimed at confirming the maximum range and other technical aspects of the missile it says was capable of delivering a ‘large-sized, heavy nuclear warhead.’
Pyongyang’s continuing development of nuclear weapons is a growing cause of concern for leaders in the United States, South Korea and Japan.
We retaliated with the South Koreans by firing off missiles to show our might. I don’t think the little troll was impressed to say the least. And it’s not just Japan, South Korea and the US in danger now. Kim Jong-un hasn’t expressed a strong desire to attack mainland Europe, but new analysis would suggest London, Paris, Berlin and Rome are all within range… although the missiles would have to soar above land as opposed to the Pacific and negotiate the earth’s rotation. North Korea is now a planetary existential threat to mankind.
The ICBM was fired at a lofted trajectory and traveled 600 miles into the Sea of Japan. Reports suggest the maximum altitude of the launch was 2,300 miles and that it flew for 47 minutes. At a standard trajectory, the missile would have a range of 6,500 miles, not accounting for the Earth’s rotation. The rotation of the Earth increases the range of missiles fired eastward, depending on their direction. Officials have no idea if North Korea has successfully married a nuclear warhead to their missiles yet. Their testing has sped up immensely.
South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-moo called for the deployment of strategic US military assets — which usually means stealth bombers and aircraft carriers — as well as additional launchers of an advanced US anti-missile system. The KCNA said that the test confirmed important features of the missile system, such as the proper separation of the warhead and controlling its movement and detonation after atmospheric re-entry.
Our military experts are now saying that North Korea will have an ICBM capable of carrying a nuclear warhead as early as next year. They can already reach Washington, DC. Just imagine what they might do. Shooting down missiles is not a precise endeavor and there is also no way of knowing if North Korea will use EMPs against us. As I’ve said before, we are long past diplomacy options and sanctions are useless against North Korea. It’s time to act.
North Koreans watch a news broadcast on a missile launch in Pyongyang on Saturday.
An expert said if reports of the missile’s maximum altitude and flight time are correct, it would have a theoretical range of at least 6,500 miles, which could reach Chicago.
In a show of force against the dictator and his military, the United States and South Korea held a joint missile exercise in response.

WATCH: Golden Retriever Jumps into Ocean to Save Drowning Deer at Long Island Beach,"A golden retriever leaped into the ocean to save a drowning deer during a morning walk on a Long Island beach, according to a video captured by the dog’s owner.
What a morning…can't believe this…Storm just saved this baby deer from PJ Harbor…
Posted by Mark Freeley on Sunday, July 16, 2017
Mark Freeley, the dog’s owner, told NBC New York that he had been taking his dog, Storm, for a walk along PJ Harbor around 8 a.m. Sunday, when Storm jumped into the water to swim after something.
The video shows the dog swimming to shore while grabbing a large fawn in its mouth.
Once Storm made it to shore, he placed the deer on the sand. The deer struggled to stand up, so the dog carried the deer farther inland by the rocks.
The dog lay the fawn down on the rocky area, licking and nudging the deer in attempts to revive it.
The deer appeared to be breathing, so Storm and his owner stayed with it until a veterinarian and a representative from Strong Island Animal Rescue showed up, WTVT reports.
The vet took the fawn to her car, and the animal is being treated. Although covered in ticks and suffering from an eye injury, the fawn is expected to make a full recovery, RNN reports.
Freeley’s Facebook video has amassed more than 1.5 million views and more than 36,000 shares as of Monday afternoon.",Conservative Fighters,1

Corpus Christi municipal court judge Young Min Burkett became a U.S. citizen Friday and established her eligibility to continue serving in the City Council-appointed capacity.

CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas — A municipal judge appointed to her position without being a U.S. citizen surmounted that hurdle Friday and is ready to get back to work.
The Corpus Christi City Council placed Judge Young Min Burkett on unpaid leave in mid-May after city officials discovered that she was a permanent legal resident.
U.S. citizenship is a requirement to be a municipal court judge, according to the city’s ordinance. But the application for judgeship asked only whether a prospect was eligible for legal employment in Texas.
Burkett had 90 days to obtain citizenship. She did it in 51, thanks to an expedited review from the U.S. Customs and Immigration Services office in San Antonio.
► July: New York judge sentenced to 60 days jail, 3 years probation
► May: Municipal judge in Texas on unpaid leave pending U.S. citizenship
""I'm very grateful it was processed in a short period of time,"" she said. Now she awaits City Council action to reinstate her.
She applied for citizenship immediately after being placed on leave, husband Nathan Burkett said. Young Min Burkett never claimed to be a citizen with the city nor did she register to vote with the county.
Those were factors in the federal government's decision to grant the Burketts' request for an expedited citizenship process, he said.

► 2014: Jury finds controversial Ohio judge guilty of felony
""She has been eligible for it for a long time, but we just haven’t done it partly because she would have to give up her South Korean citizenship,"" Nathan Burkett said.
Neither the United States nor South Korea permit dual citizenship. But her love for the municipal court judgeship spurred her to forfeit her South Korean citizenship, her husband said.
U.S. District Judge Nelva Ramos administered the oath of citizenship. It took less than a minute.
""It was hard for me to give up my (Korean) citizenship, but I always wanted to be a U.S. citizen,"" Young Burkett said. ""Finally, to serve this community I decided to become a U.S. citizen, and I'm glad I made that decision.""

Bernie Sanders refuses to answer when pressed on FBI bank fraud investigation of his wife,"Carlos Garcia 4 hours
Sen. Bernie Sanders appeared to become very agitated when CNN's Erin Burnett pressed him on reports that his wife was under FBI investigation for alleged bank fraud. (Image Source: YouTube screenshot)
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) grew agitated when he was asked by CNN’s Erin Burnett on Tuesday whether his wife, Jane Sanders, was the subject of an investigation by the FBI over possible fraud in a failed land deal from her days as president of Burlington College.
“We understand your wife has hired a lawyer to represent her in a possible probe into a land deal that fell apart,” Burnett said. “This was back when she was president of Burlington College—”
“No, it was not when she was, oh,” Sanders interrupted, “let me say a word about that, you know.”
“I just want to ask you,” Burnett continued, “do you know if she’s under FBI investigation?”
“Excuse me,” Sanders interjected, “my wife is about the most honest person I know. When she came to that college, it was failing financially and academically. When she left it, it was in better shape than it had ever been.”
“Five years later, just at the moment, coincidentally no doubt, when I’m a candidate for president of the United States, Donald Trump’s campaign manager, a co-chair, vice chairman of the Republican Party in Vermont launched this investigation,” he continued.
“So all that I will tell you now, Erin, it is a sad state of affairs in America,” Sanders added, “not only when we have you know politicians being destroyed … when there are attacks against elected officials, when you’re going after your wife, people’s wives, that is pretty pathetic, and that’s where we are right now, and that’s about all that I’m going to say.”
“I do just want to understand though,” Burnett pressed, “at this time, do you have any knowledge as to whether she’s under FBI investigation?”
“That’s all that I want to say, and we’ll let it play out,” he responded. “But I think it’s fairly pathetic that when, you know, people are involved in public life, it’s not only that they get attacked, but it’s their wives and their families that they get attacked. That’s what this is about.”
The investigation involves a $10 million loan that Jane Sanders secured for Burlington College to purchase 33 acres of land. Investigators believe Sanders might have embellished the financial health of the institution in order to obtain the loan. When the donations she promised didn’t materialize, the college defaulted. Prosecutors may also be looking into whether Sen. Sanders used his political position to encourage the loan.
This isn’t the only scandal that has mired Sanders’ post-presidential campaign life. After the terrible shooting targeting Republicans in Alexandria, Virginia, it was discovered that the shooter was an enthusiastic supporter of Sanders while spewing vile comments on social media against Republicans.
Sanders denounced the violence but many reminded him of how he tried to pin the 2011 shooting of Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords (Ariz.) on former Alaska governor and one-time GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.",TheBlaze,1

CO Officials: We’ve Never Seen Such a Sudden Exodus of Voters,"byShawn M. Griffiths in Electoral ReformJul 14, 2017",Independent Voter Network (IVN),0
Classic: Thomas Sowell Schools a Welfare Administrator,"In the 1980s, a television show hosted by the economics Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman called Free to Choose (after Friedman’s book by the same name) aired on PBS, with great success. The pro-capitalism, anti-big-government show began with Friedman explaining a topic within politics and economics (episode titles included Created Equal, What’s Wrong with Our Schools?, Who Protects the Consumer? Who Protects the Worker? How to Cure Inflation, among others), followed by a debate afterwards.
President Ronald Reagan presented the introduction to one of the episodes in the series, as did Arnold Schwarzenegger.
In one of the notable debates, a young Thomas Sowell – universally regarded as one of the top conservative intellectuals and economists of his generation – faced off against a welfare administrator, picking off her arguments one by one. Watch below:
And his words on welfare today are worth sharing too. Here are some words of wisdom from his essay “The Mindset of the Left.”
“Poverty” once had some concrete meaning — not enough food to eat or not enough clothing or shelter to protect you from the elements, for example. Today it means whatever the government bureaucrats, who set up the statistical criteria, choose to make it mean. And they have every incentive to define poverty in a way that includes enough people to justify welfare state spending. Most Americans with incomes below the official poverty level have air-conditioning, television, own a motor vehicle and, far from being hungry, are more likely than other Americans to be overweight. But an arbitrary definition of words and numbers gives them access to the taxpayers’ money.
Even when they have the potential to become productive members of society, the loss of welfare state benefits if they try to do so is an implicit “tax” on what they would earn that often exceeds the explicit tax on a millionaire. If increasing your income by $10,000 would cause you to lose $15,000 in government benefits, would you do it? In short, the political left’s welfare state makes poverty more comfortable, while penalizing attempts to rise out of poverty.
He concludes with some powerful observation about who really benefits from the welfare state:
…the left’s agenda is a disservice to [the poor], as well as to society. …The agenda of the left — promoting envy and a sense of grievance, while making loud demands for “rights” to what other people have produced — is a pattern that has been widespread in countries around the world. This agenda has seldom lifted the poor out of poverty. But it has lifted the left to positions of power and self-aggrandizement, while they promote policies with socially counterproductive results.
Welfare hurts those it’s supposed to help. And the worst part is, the left knows it. It’s all about power.

Mayor De Blasio Gets a Cold Reception at Funeral of Slain NYPD Officer,"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is no friend to the New York Police Department, but that’s ok. They’re not feeling very hospitable towards him, either.
And who can blame them?
Last week, NYPD Officer Miosotis Familia was murdered by a gunman, as she sat with her partner in her patrol car.
Familia was a 12 year veteran of the force.
So how did de Blasio react to this attack?
He hopped a plane to Germany, to play Protest-boy at the G20 Summit the very next day.
Book: Mafia Hit-Man & Teamster Boss Helped Joe Biden Become U.S. Senator
The Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association head Patrick Lynch blasted de Blasio for his absence.
“The mayor is the compass for the city of New York,” Lynch told the Daily News before Familia’s funeral. “And unfortunately, when a police officer got killed, his compass led him to Germany rather than here on the Concourse. He should have been here with the family…He should have been there with us.”
Officer Familia’s funeral service was held earlier Tuesday. De Blasio managed to show up for this, complete with rehearsed speech.
So how was this received?
Hundreds of NYPD officers turned their backs to de Blasio.
This isn’t the first time de Blasio has warranted this treatment.
NYPD cops made a similar symbolic gesture in 2014, turning their back on de Blasio as tensions mounted between police and the mayor over the death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, at the hands of police, as well as the assassination of two NYPD officers, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, by a gunman.
I remember how quick de Blasio was to throw his police officers under the bus then, as well.
De Blasio is the worst example of a smug liberal, so invested in his social justice causes that he forgets to represent ALL of New York City.
The remedy for that is at the ballot box.

BREAKING: 19 Attorneys General Unite In Lawsuit To Take Betsy DeVos Down,"In yet another setback for the Trump administration, 19 state attorneys general are now suing Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for rolling back President Obama’s student loan reforms. Let this be a warning for everyone else in Team Trump: Make a toxic policy decision and you should expect to see the Democrats in court.
These attorneys general are the lead prosecutors in their home states. And now, they’re banding together for the good of the American people to stop DeVos from gutting the American education system once and for all.
Thus, these 19 Democratic bulldogs just filed a complaint in a U.S. District Court to reverse DeVos’ revocation of the Borrower Defense Repayment rule. This Obama-era rule “was designed to hold abusive higher education institutions accountable for cheating students and taxpayers out of billions of dollars in federal loans,” per The Hill.
So when for-profit, predatory schools started asking DeVos to do away with this bill, she was all ears. And by revoking the bill, she screwed over MILLIONS of students who are struggling with student loan debt as it is.
The good news is that the Democrats are going all-in on this fight. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey released a statement EVISCERATING DeVos’ spineless leadership.
“Since day one, Secretary DeVos has sided with for-profit school executives against students and families drowning in unaffordable student loans,” Healey said. “Her decision to cancel vital protections for students and taxpayers is a betrayal of her office’s responsibility and a violation of federal law.”
Julie Murray, a Public Citizen attorney helping to lead the Democrats’ case against DeVos, also released her own statement on the lawsuit. She let the nation know that this betrayal of our vulnerable students and families will not stand.
“Secretary Betsy DeVos has effectively revoked students’ rights under the rule while giving a pass to predatory schools that wield influence with this administration,” Murray said. “We are asking the court to order this administration to implement the rule now, as the law requires.”
But this is Team Trump’s signature brand, really. Screwing over Americans so that the Trump admin can give lucrative handouts to massive corporate entities—for-profit colleges in this case.
Here’s hoping these attorneys general give DeVos a whooping in federal court. The American people are depending on them for justice in these dark days.
POLL: Is Betsy DeVos destroying the education system?
Where do you stand? Do you think Betsy DeVos is trying her very best to gut the American education system?
Please participate in our poll below! There’s no better time than now to stand up and speak out!
It is unbelievable that Republican voters WILLINGLY put people like Trump and DeVos in power. These goons are destroying all that’s good and decent about our nation, and they’re doing it with smiles on their faces.
Enough is enough. Team Trump needs to answer for their abuses against the American people before too much damage has been done.
If you want to help out in the fight against Trump, we’d love to have you. Please share this story far and wide on Facebook!",Learn Progress,1

Trump donates second quarter paycheck; liberals IMPLODE when the find out where,"In September 2016, presidential candidate Donald Trump was asked at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire if he would take the $400,000 presidential salary.
He responded in a way only a billionaire saying, “The first thing I’m going to do is tell you that if I’m elected president, I’m accepting no salary, OK? … That’s no big deal for me.”
Now, as president, Trump continues to make good on his promise, giving his entire second-quarter paycheck to the Department of Education.

According to the Department of Education press release:
Today, President Donald J. Trump donated his second quarter salary to the Department of Education to help fund a STEM-focused camp for students. The donation, totaling $100,000, was accepted by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos at the daily White House Press briefing where she delivered the following remarks:
“I want to start by saying how grateful I am to the President for this generous gift. The President has truly shown his commitment to our nation’s students and to reforming education in America so that every child, no matter their ZIP code, has access to a high quality education.
Secretary Devos added “Today’s and tomorrow’s economy requires engaged students, boys and girls, are prepared for STEM [science-technology-engineering-math] careers. That’s why we have decided to use the President’s 2nd quarter salary to host a STEM-focused camp for students at the Department of Education. We want to encourage as many children as possible to explore STEM fields in the hope that many develop a passion for these fields.”
Devos’ full remarks can be heard here:
Ironically, Trump has been criticized lately for a budget proposal that would cut STEM funding by 17 percent for fiscal year 2018.
However, Trump has also taken a stance against H1B visas, which critics argue take jobs from American STEM graduates.
Trump, interestingly, donated his first quarter presidential salary to the National Park Service, an agency within the Interior Department which is also facing cuts from Trump’s proposed budget.

Transgender Republican Caitlyn Jenner wants to run for political office!,"Jul. 17, 2017 12:48 pmJul. 17, 2017 4:58 am by SooperMexican • No Comments
Transgender advocate Caitlyn Jenner says she might run for political office. She told John Catsimatidis that she might run for the Senate seat for California on his show, “Cats Roundtable.”
“I have considered it,” Jenner said. “I like the political side of it. If there’s one thing — I work very closely with the American Unity Fund — that their sole purpose, their mission statement is to get the Republican party to do a better job with all LGBT issues.”
The American Unity Fund website says the organization is “dedicated to advancing the cause of freedom for LGBTQ Americans by making the conservative case that freedom truly means freedom for everyone.”
“Over the next six months or so I’ve got to figure out where I can do a better job. Can I do a better job from the outside? Working the perimeter of the political scene?”
“Or, are you better off from the inside. And we are in the process of determining that. And yeah, I would look for a senatorial run.”

Ohio Sheriff Takes Hard Stance on Overdoses: Won’t Let Deputies Administer Narcan.,"The opioid epidemic in the United States continues to take lives. It also takes a toll on the resources of hospitals and law enforcement. And now an Ohio Sheriff has forbidden the use of a drug that is commonly given to stop an overdose. The use of Narcan, he feels, is creating more problems than it is solving.
[Scroll Down for Video]
Richard K. Jones, Sheriff of Butler County, Ohio, told the Cincinnati Enquirer about his new philosophy. “I don’t do Narcan,” Jones told the paper. His deputies “never carried it… nor will they.”
The drug is effective at reviving overdose patients, and Sheriff Jones’s refusal to use it is raising ethical questions. Ohio has more opioid overdoses than any other state in the nation.
This is something Sheriff Jones is well aware of. In 2003, the Ohio Department of Health logged 24 overdose deaths. By 2015, that number had risen to 195. It continues to climb.
Ohio’s staggering epidemic has prompted other figures to propose shocking measures. Middletown city council member Dan Picard wants a three-strike style plan for repeat-overdose cases. The cost of medical treatment would have to be repaid by community service. If an individual doesn’t do the community service, they no longer receive the drugs needed to reverse their overdoses.
“My proposal is in regard to the financial survivability of our city. If we’re spending $2 million this year and $4 million next year and $6 million after that, we’re in trouble. We’re going to have to start laying off. We’re going to have to raise taxes,” he explained to The Washington Post.
For Sheriff Jones, the use of Narcan goes beyond simple economics. He notes that opioid and heroin addicts are often violent. An overdose eliminates that violence, but–once revived–the patients can again become violent and may begin vomiting. Jones fear for his officers who have to get that close to potentially hazardous situations. “To get on the ground and spray [Narcan] in their nose is simply dangerous.”
Jones told Fox News that Narcan has “helped revive and save some lives but [did] not bring down the usage of heroin.” He went on to describe heroin parties that had designated Narcan administrators the way some parties may have designated drivers. It is this type of willful endangerment that Jones feels is at the root of the problem.
The question of who is, or who is not responsible for administering Narcan is complicated. Most law enforcement agents are tasked with the duty of saving lives as first responders. Yet this is a criminal matter, too.
The decision to forgo the use of Narcan will, inevitably, result in an increase in overdose deaths. Is that what it will take to end the abuse of the drugs?",The Tribunist,1
Professor Fired After Promoting Racial Discrimination on ‘Tucker Carlson’,"Written by Keely Sharp
The last couple hundred of years have been engulfed with social justice issues such as slavery and then segregation and racism. We now live in a time when we are all intermingled in public, workplaces, and even relationships, despite our skin color. So why are people like Professor Lisa Durden from Essex County College working to promote racial division and discrimination again. It is as if we did a complete U-turn and started heading back from where we came.
All is not lost though. The professor has been fired after appearing on Tucker Carlson on June 6. Tucker mentioned how racism Black Lives Matter really is, stating, “The whole point of Black Lives Matter, or one of the points, would be to speak out against singling people out on the basis of their race and punishing them for that because you can’t control what your race is, and yet they seem to be doing that, explain that to me.”
Durden huffed, and puffed, and replied, “What I say to that is boo, hoo, hoo, you white people are angry because you couldn’t use your white privilege card to get invited to the Black Lives Matters, all black, Memorial Day celebration.”
She then continued on to say the following:
“Memorial Day was created by black former slaves in 1865 to honor those individuals who were Union soldiers who fought and died for our freedoms so Black Lives Matter in that same vein decided to get together with black folks to honor black folks. To make sure that black folks was celebrated for being murdered by racist terrorists! …This particular day, [Black Lives Matter] said, “Stay your asses out! We want to celebrate today.” We don’t want anybody going against us today.”
Yikes. Nothing but racial division. This is Obama’s legacy.
TRENDING ON EAGLE RISING
On June 8, when she showed up to teach at Essex County College, Jeffrey Lee, vice president for academic affairs, gave Durden a letter informing her that she was suspended “until further notice.”
Durden whined to The Star-Ledger. “They did this to humiliate me. Essex County College publicly lynched me in front of my students.” She claimed that Karen Bridgett, assistant director of Human Resources, told her someone “complained” that Burden had mentioned she taught at the college on Carlson’s show (she didn’t); Durden claimed that was the reason she was suspended.
Durden’s attorney, Leslie Farber, stated, “There’s got to be some other agenda. It seems to me they’re going to make up some reason. We’ve got to figure out what that is and why. Is she too outspoken?”
I think she got what she deserved. The college made a very smart move in detaching themselves from her.

Saudi Ambassador to Moscow has high hopes for King Salman’s Russian visit,"Adam Garrie5 hours agoJuly 26, 2017 99
Saudi Arabia's King Salman is preparing for his first ever visit to Russia. This is the same Russia that maintains good relations with Iran, Syria, Qatar, Iraq, Palestine, Israel and Egypt.
Recent events in the Persian Gulf have shattered the perennially false myth that somehow Russia was working with Iran and Syria to foment a so-called ‘Shi’a Crescent’ in the Middle East.
This was never true as Russia, in addition to being allies with Shi’a Iran and multi-denominational Syria, always had either normal or good relations with Sunni majority countries in the Arab world including Egypt, Libya, Palestine and the Sunni Arab states of the Persian Gulf.
Recent events in the Persian Gulf have enhanced Russia’s standing in the region without having any negative implications for Russia. The Qatar crisis has elevated Russia’s position as a genuinely neutral arbiter in this respect. Qatar’s Foreign Minister recently praised Russia as the “main player on the international arena”.
These words from Qatar haven’t however hindered Russia’s surprisingly good relations with Saudi Arabia. The Saudi King Salman is preparing for his first ever visit to Russia. Not only is this Salman’s first visit to Moscow but it will be the first for any Saudi head of state.
Saudi’s ambassador to Moscow Abdulaziz Al Saud has spoken warmly of his thoughts on the forthcoming visit,
“Any visit of such a high level requires tremendous preparation, given that this is the first visit of the King to Russia. It will be a historic visit that will lay the foundation for strategic relations with Russia and open broad prospects for cooperation in all fields. In this regard, we are continuing to coordinate efforts with our Russian friends”.
This deeply positive statement affirms that unlike Turkey which has sided with Qatar in overtly ideological terms, Russia’s genuine neutrality is respected by Riyadh. Beyond this however, is an even more crucial fact. Because Saudi Arabia and Russia (from its position outside of OPEC) are both global energy suppliers, Saudi Arabia may ultimately need Russia more than it needs its traditional American ally. This is especially true as under Donald Trump, the US is making strides in becoming energy independent. While American energy is still expensive by global standards, Trump has affirmed that he seeks to remake America from an energy importer into an exporter.
While Russia remains close with Saudi’s regional foe Iran, Russia’s position of having pragmatic relations with all countries on a materially case by case basis rather than an ideological one, has put Russia in a unique position to cultivate friends and partners at various levels without making enemies along the way.
This is one of the primary reasons that Russia’s role in the Middle East has become one of increased prestige while America’s super-power status in the region has been visibly downgraded.

PHOTOS: The Outfit Ivanka Trump Was Wearing Today In Poland Caught Everyone’s Eye,"Ivanka Trump paid a solemn visit to Warsaw’s Monument to the Ghetto Heroes on Thursday – after Poland’s chief rabbi issued a statement criticizing the failure of President Trump to pay his respects there.
The first daughter laid a wreath at the landmark which honors the leaders of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of the Second World War.
Jewish leaders, including Michael Schudrich, Poland’s chief rabbi, issued a statement Wednesday criticizing President Trump for failing to schedule a visit, despite speaking to 5,000 cheering Poles nearby.
‘We deeply regret that President Trump, though speaking in public barely a mile away from the monument, chose to break with that laudable tradition, alongside so many other ones,’ according to the statement. ‘We trust that this slight does not reflect the attitudes and feelings of the American people.’
Ivanka Trump today wore tight china blue and white floral print dress which accentuated every curve.
The sleeveless dress had a low neckline which just stopped short of showing any cleavage.
The dress was tight all the way down to Ivanka’s thighs before coming out in an exaggerated pleat detail which fell just below her knee.
She paired the dress with a pair of nude stiletto heels.
Ivanka wore a slim red bracelet on her wrist a diamond ring on her right hand.
She kept her makeup simple, opting for neutral eyeshadow and a nude lip.
Ivanka wore her hair down in a blow-dry which flicked in at the ends.

California to vote on regulating toxic chemicals in water,"July 18 (UPI) -- California officials are poised Tuesday to regulate a substance in water that experts say is a powerful cancer-causing agent in water worldwide.
The substance -- called 1,2,3 trichloropropane, or TCP -- is prevalent in the Central Valley of California as a degreasing agent used in the production of plastic products.
The majority of residents in the San Joaquin Valley rely on groundwater as their drinking water. In 2016, 63 percent of California public water systems that detected nitrates, including TCP, were in the Valley, according to the State Water Resources Control Board.
The Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization, released a report in April that found 94 water systems serving eight million Californians are contaminated with 1,2,3-trichloropropane.
It then updated its report to say additional analysis found the substance as a contaminant in the drinking water of at least 17 states. It plans to issue more details on the nationwide tests.
Residents of the Central California farming communities are blaming their sickness on the TCP.
""The word that really captures all of it is 'outrage,'"" said Jerry Tinoco, 45, a resident of the city of Arvin who told NBC News and at least three close family members have been diagnosed with cancer. ""It's a man-made chemical, so someone is to blame.""
No research shows the chemical has caused cancer spikes in specific communities, but some residents and experts told NBC News that research has yet to be done in towns like Arvin.
But the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has concluded it's ""likely to be carcinogenic to humans."" The California Water Board warns residents not to shower with tainted water because they might inhale the chemical.
The Water Board plans to set a legally permitted limit -- a Maximum Contaminant Level, or MCL -- requiring public utilities to test their water and, if needed, install filters to lower the level of the chemical.
So far, Hawaii is the only state with a legal limit -- 600 parts per trillion.
""If you drink water over a lifetime that contains 1,2,3-TCP at concentrations higher than the
PHG, there is an increased lifetime risk of developing cancer,"" the Water Board said on its websitre. ""The increased risk depends on 1,2,3-TCP concentration in the water. For water with a 1,2,3-TCP concentration of 5 ppt, the increased lifetime cancer risk is less than one cancer case per 100,000 people. For water with a 1,2,3-TCP concentration of 70 ppt, the increased lifetime cancer risk is about one in 10,000 people.
Paul Tratnyek, a professor at the Institute of Environmental Health at Oregon Health and Science University has studied TCP for the Defense Department.
""Even the slightest amount of TCP in the water would be considered to be a potential health effect,"" Tratnyek said.
In Arvin, the city tested the water for TCP. A state-certified lab found more than six times the amount the state says is acceptable.
In California's Central Valley, the high TCP levels are attributed to two industrial giants that recycled TCP by packaging it with agricultural pesticides.
""TCP got into drinking water in the Central Valley because Dow Chemical Company and Shell Oil Company saw an opportunity decades ago to take a hazardous waste stream at their chemical plants, put it in barrels and sell it to farmers, who would then inject it into the ground,"" said lawyer Toss Robbins, who represents 30 communities that are suing Dow and Shell to get them to pay for the multi-million dollar filtration process required to clean water supplies.
In 2010, the companies prevailed in a 2010 lawsuit filed by the city of Redlands. But the companies have settled other suits. In a Central Valley city two hours north of Arvin, a jury awarded Clovis $22 million to treat contaminated water and remove TCP from its wells.
In a statement, Shell said that the product has been out of use for years, it contained only ""trace amounts"" of TCP and that it was approved by the federal and California governments.",United Press International – US,0

The Russian spies living next door,"Program note: CNN's ""Declassified"" reveals the story of Russia's secret network of deep-cover spies living in the United States on Saturday July 22, at 9 p.m. ET/PT.
(CNN)For unsuspecting residents of a suburban Montclair, New Jersey, neighborhood, it seemed too crazy to be believed: their quiet, unassuming neighbors had turned out to be Russian spies.
The couple, known as Richard and Cynthia Murphy, had appeared to be part of a typical American family, living in a beige, two-story colonial-style home with their two young daughters at 31 Marquette Road.
Cynthia's business card said she worked as a financial planner at an accounting company in nearby Manhattan. Richard told neighbors he was a stay-at-home dad raising Lisa, age nine, and her 11-year-old sister, Kate.
The shocking truth emerged when the FBI raided the house in 2010: Richard and Cynthia's real names were Vladimir and Lydia Guryev.
""You could have told me they were Martians from space and I would have been less surprised,"" said Elizabeth Lapin, a poetry professor who still lives down the street from the home now known as ""the spy house.""
The Guryevs had been gathering information since the 1990s for Russia's SVR, which the FBI describes as the modern equivalent of the KGB. The KGB, if you remember, was the widely feared national security agency of the now-defunct Soviet Union, tasked during the Cold War with running a domestic secret police force and operating a network of spies throughout the world.
On June 27, 2010, the FBI arrested the Guryevs along with eight other alleged Russian spies in Manhattan, Yonkers, Boston and northern Virginia. The announcement triggered headlines reminiscent of the Cold War, and even inspired the creation of FX's 1980s-era spy drama ""The Americans.""

Her business card said she worked as a financial planner at an accounting company in nearby Manhattan. He told neighbors he was a stay-at-home dad. In June of 2010, the FBI arrested the Guryevs along with eight other accused spies scattered in Boston, Manhattan, Yonkers and Virginia. They all pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government within the United States without notifying the US Attorney General. All ten spies and their children were transferred to Russia in an exchange for the release of four people who were ""incarcerated in Russia for alleged contact with Western intelligence agencies,"" according to the Justice Department.

Now, seven years later, the ""house just sits there and it's empty,"" said Jessie Gugig, who lives just a stone's throw away. ""It's just a constant reminder,"" Gugig said. ""Nature is kind of taking the house back. Ivy is starting to eat into the house. The garden is completely overgrown.""
Photos: The spies next door
The Guryevs -- along with the other spies who were arrested -- held various official documents such as these passports that backed up their fake identities, the FBI said.

The FBI had been watching the Guryevs for years to determine who they were working with and what their mission was.

The FBI secretly searched their home and found this notebook. It helped them break the code that spies were using to communicate with Moscow. The notebook contained a strange system of numbers and letters which turned out to be computer keystrokes. After using trial and error with several combinations, investigators cracked the 27-digit password which opened messages hidden inside photographs that spies had posted online. When the FBI was able to crack the code, they could then eavesdrop on what the spies planned to do next.

This FBI surveillance image shows Vladimir Guryev, known as Richard Murphy, to the left at a New York train station receiving a package from another Russian agent. It was part of the evidence that the FBI used as evidence against the Guryevs.

Another of the arrested spies was Anna Chapman, shown here in an FBI surveillance photo.

Unlike the Guryevs, Chapman was living in the United States under her real name. She had obtained British citizenship by marrying a citizen of the United Kingdom. After their divorce, Chapman kept her married name and moved to New York City, the FBI said. She was posing as a real estate agent.

Mikhail Semenko was living outside Washington under his real name before he was arrested as part of the group of ten. The FBI said his background check was clean enough to allow him entry into the United States on a student visa. Nonetheless, he eventually worked as a spy for Russia, the FBI said.

Foley had this Massachusetts real estate broker's license, a photo of which CNN obtained from the FBI. The FBI said Heathfield and Foley created their fake identities by using birth certificates of deceased infants and then posing as those deceased people -- building identities around the documents.

This FBI surveillance photo shows alleged Russian spy Christopher Robert Metsos in the US. Metsos is still at large, the FBI says.
But while the deep-cover Russian spies on ""The Americans"" ""do all sorts of reckless, wild things,"" said neighbor Virginia Bailey, that wasn't the impression she got from the Guryevs.
""By all accounts,"" Bailey told CNN, ""these neighbors were neither reckless nor wild.""
This is what it was really like to live next door to a Russian spy, according to various Montclair residents who spoke to CNN.
Hiding in plain sight
Looking back, neighbors say the Guryevs' ""spy house"" was a perfect place to hide in plain sight. Manhattan was just 30 minutes away by shuttle bus. And the house property backed up against a 21-acre wildlife preserve where meetings with agents and exchanges of information could easily be hidden from prying eyes.
The family wasn't overly social -- but they weren't exactly hiding either. Neighbors say they sometimes attended summer neighborhood block parties.
Before the raid, Bailey and her daughter, Jessie Gugig, remember seeing their neighbor ""Cynthia"" walking her dog many mornings down Marquette Road. Although they never stopped to have a conversation, Bailey remembered her as being ""very attractive and very well put together. She always dressed very nicely.""
Some neighbors said the couple spoke with accents, but Lapin said she never heard one.
""The girls built a lemonade stand one summer,"" Lapin said. ""That was such an American thing.""
Lapin said she had a ""premonition"" that ""something strange"" was going on long before the raid. A few months before, she noticed unusual, prolonged construction under the neighborhood streets. The Friday before the raid, she said a police car had been parked in front of her house.
But espionage? It never occurred to her, Lapin said.
How they got caught
The FBI and CIA first learned about the collection of deep-cover SVR spies in the United States in the early 2000s. They were living as so-called ""illegals,"" meaning they had no diplomatic protection.

US authorities secretly surveilled all the spies for years, bugging the Guryevs' house and even secretly searching it when they weren't around. The FBI told CNN's original series ""Declassifed"" that the Guryevs tried so hard to blend into American society that they didn't even speak Russian inside their own home.
Eventually, the United States cracked a secret code the spies used to communicate with Moscow, allowing the FBI to learn more about the Guryevs' comings and goings. In 2009, the FBI shot video of a meeting between Vladimir and a Russian government official. Authorities decided it was time to arrest the spy ring.

Jessie Gugig remembers being a 15-year-old experiencing the shock of watching FBI vans stop at the Guryevs' home, just a stone's throw from her own residence.
""Eventually another car pulled up and guys in suits with earpieces showed up with some papers that must have been a warrant,"" Gugig, now a 22-year-old law student, recalled. Agents suddenly poured into the home, turning on the lights and searching it from top to bottom.
""The house got lit up like it was Christmas,"" she said.
For at least a week after the raid, the press seemed to be everywhere throughout the neighborhood, said Gugig's mother Bailey. ""I mean hordes of them,"" she said. ""It was just a carnival.""
Lapin gathered up enough courage to approach the house after the arrest and peer into the window. Inside she saw several items on a table — including Lisa's textbook on Chinese grammar, stacks of coins and a copy of a 1953 post-World War-II memoir, ""Woman in Berlin.""
On the wall next to a piano was a ""beautiful painting"" of a young girl, which Lapin believes was a self-portrait by Kate.
The Guryevs' two girls, Bailey said, were taken away to stay with a family friend.
What happened to the kids?
Two weeks after the FBI arrests, Moscow and Washington made a deal.
After all ten of those arrested pleaded guilty to being Russian agents, the United States agreed to transfer them to Russian custody. In exchange, Moscow agreed to release ""four individuals"" who were ""incarcerated in Russia for alleged contact with Western intelligence agencies,"" the Justice Department said.
Kate and Lisa -- who were born in the United States -- eventually accompanied their parents back to Russia. US Attorney General Eric Holder told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" in 2010 that the Guryevs' kids and all other children of the Russian agents were ""repatriated.""
""That whole aspect was very sad,"" said Bailey. ""To all of a sudden have their lives completely and utterly changed. The children didn't know Russia ... They have to leave their friends abruptly and suddenly. ... Everything would have just been so radically different.""
Former FBI operative Eric O'Neill, who helped catch FBI double agent Robert Hanssen, said in 2010 that it's unusual for spies serving overseas to have children, because they could suffer from divided loyalties.
""When you're a parent, you're supposed to take care of your kids. You are supposed to put them first in your life. And a spy can't do that,"" O'Neill said.
Are other spies still living among us?
At the time, having Russian spies in the neighborhood felt like a weird throwback to the Cold War, neighbors said.
But now that people on Marquette Road are hearing more about heightened tensions between Russia and the United States, they say the idea of Russian spies living among Americans doesn't seem so surprising. Some of them are following the current US government investigations into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and potential collusion with members of Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
US investigations about Russia: Everything you need to know
In fact, Russian spies are ramping up their intelligence-gathering efforts inside the United States, current and former US intelligence officials told CNN this month.
Former Soviet KGB spymaster Oleg Kalugin told CNN he ""would not be surprised"" to learn that Russia is still running illegal deep-cover spies in the United States. But he suspects these programs would be less active now than in 2010. Kalugin, who says he never ran illegal deep-cover programs, criticized them as wasteful and inefficient.
""It's risky and lonely and a really difficult job,"" he said.
One of the key pieces of evidence uncovered by the FBI in the 2010 case was a message Russian spymasters sent the Guryevs shortly before their arrest.
""You were sent to USA for long-term service trip,"" the message said. ""Your education, bank accounts, car, house etc. -- all these serve one goal: fulfill your main mission, i.e. to search and develop ties in policymaking circles and send intels to C.""
""C"" is thought to refer to ""The Center,"" an espionage information clearinghouse in Russia.
What's next for the 'spy house'
Built in 1950, the beige, two-story house is a typical middle class home for the area. It measures a bit more than 1,800 square feet and the county valued it this year at $425,700, according to Essex County tax records.
The 'spy house' where the Guryevs lived in 2010.
So much time has passed that ""it's hard to believe it happened,"" said Bailey.
""Nature is kind of taking the house back,"" Gugig said. ""Ivy is starting to eat into the house. The garden is completely overgrown.""
""The house just sits there and it's empty,"" she added. ""It's just a constant reminder.""
Lapin -- who has lived near the house for 11 years -- said the neighborhood was friendlier before the raid. ""I liked the neighborhood -- until this event happened,"" she said.
But the old vibe has slowly been coming back, she said. Several of her neighbors have left since the raid -- replaced by new residents who don't associate the house with the spies.
A local realtor said the home has recently been sold.

CBO: Repeal-only bill would lead to 32 million more uninsured by 2026,"July 19 (UPI) -- The Republican Senate bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act will result in an extra 32 million more uninsured people and higher premiums, an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation released Wednesday says.
The effects of the repeal would be immediate, according to the analysis. By 2018, the number of uninsured people would increase by 17 million, compared to the current rate under the ACA. That number will nearly double over the next few years, with 32 million more uninsured by 2026.
Reasons for the increase in uninsured are many, the CBO report says. They include a $842 billion reduction in federal funds to Medicaid to cover those living under or near the federal poverty line; a $679 billion cut in subsidies for non-group health insurance; and the elimination of a $6 billion tax credit to small businesses that provide health insurance to employees.
There also would be a decline in tax revenue from ACA-imposed penalties on those who don't buy into a private health insurance program, as well as businesses that fail to provide adequate health insurance plans.
""Other budgetary effects, mostly involving revenues, associated with shifts from taxable to non-taxable compensation resulting from net increases in employment-based health insurance coverage -- which would, on net, increase deficits by $210 billion,"" the CBO said.
Although health insurance premiums for family coverage increased by 58 percent between 2006 and 2016, with workers' shares increasing 78 percent, the CBO analysis predicts the increase could climb higher under a total repeal measure by 100 percent of the current rate by 2026.
Private health insurance companies have been increasingly refusing to provide coverage in certain parts of the country that are deemed unprofitable under ACA restrictions, leading to 31 percent of counties in the United States having only one option to choose from in the ACA marketplace, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, but the CBO predicts more counties would have fewer options under the repeal bill.
""Under this legislation, about half of the nation's population would live in areas having no insurer participating in the non-group market in 2020 because of downward pressure on enrollment and upward pressure on premiums,"" the report said. ""That share would continue to increase, extending to about three-quarters of the population by 2026.""",United Press International – US,0

Recent footage of an elephant during a rampage hit the social media recently shows an elephant flipping over a car time and again during a rampage in a local festival called Ambalapura in Thrissur, Kerala. The video shows an elephant throwing over motorcycles and then venting its fury on a car, sending everyone scrambling for cover. According to a report in Mail Online, people fled from the rampage site but no casualties were reported as, after a while, the elephant calmed down on its own.
In southern India, usage of elephants in festivals, prosessions and rituals is a common phenomenon. People were celebrating in Ambalapura when the owner of the elephant lost control of him which led to the rampage. What exactly caused the animal to start trashing everything in its way is unclear but such sudden changes can be a result of the loud noise or music, hot weather or the crowd which was a part the festival.

Afghanistan’s Lessons for Syria,"The bloody history of Afghanistan’s civil war in the 1980s – how the U.S. “victory” over the Soviets morphed into decades of chaos – is a cautionary tale for today’s Syria, writes ex-CIA analyst Paul R. Pillar.
The battle for Raqqa is now being waged, and the diverse forces that have been helping to extinguish the self-proclaimed caliphate of the so-called Islamic State (ISIS) soon must face squarely what becomes of the portion of Syria that ISIS had controlled.

It may be useful to recall an earlier and somewhat similar situation in which the defeat of a common enemy led not to peace and stability but instead to fighting among the victors. This occurred some two decades ago in another land in which, like Syria, the United States struggles to formulate a strategy: Afghanistan.
After the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989, the pro-Soviet Najibullah regime hung on for another three years before succumbing to the militias, known collectively as mujahedin, that with foreign backing (including from the United States) had fought the Soviets throughout the 1980s. This mujahedin victory was followed by an accord providing for a power-sharing arrangement, but the agreement never fully took hold.
The warlords who had been allies in fighting against the Soviets and Najibullah fell out among themselves. A new phase of the Afghan civil war ensued, which for the next few years saw fighting, especially in the cities, that was at least as intense as the decade-long combat against the Soviets.
This phase of the war concluded as a new movement of religious radicals, known as the Taliban and supported by Pakistan, swept aside the brawling militias in most of the country and imposed their own version of order in south and central Afghanistan. The Taliban are, of course, today widely considered to be a principal adversary in Afghanistan of the United States and its allies.
There are obvious differences between this piece of Afghan history and the current situation in eastern Syria, but there nonetheless are several observations about the former that apply as well to the latter.

There was too little advance planning or effort at accommodation that looked beyond whatever was the immediate military objective. This deficiency was at least as true of the United States as of any of the other external or internal participants in either war.
There was no military solution to the differences and disagreements that ensued after the earlier enemy was defeated. No single Afghan militia was strong enough to overpower the rest. Even the Taliban never gained control of all of Afghanistan; a coalition in the northern portion of the country continued to resist.
In Syria, the Assad regime, especially with its Russian and Iranian backing, is not going away. But neither does it have the strength (and its foreign backers do not have the will) to gain control over all Syrian territory and to wipe out the sources of resistance to the regime.
The new phase of civil war (in Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal) reflected bloated ambitions and mission creep stimulated by earlier victories, not well-considered objectives that would justify a prolongation of the war. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was the most destructive of the power-hungry chieftains in Afghanistan, but hardly the only one.
In the Syrian war, echoes of Afghanistan are heard in talk, including in debates on U.S. policy, about moving against the interests of Russia, Iran or the Assad regime as part of a military expedition that was supposed to have been all about defeating ISIS.
The problems, threats and adversaries that emerge from prolongation of the civil war into a new phase may take new forms that are difficult to foresee. In Afghanistan in 1992, as Najibullah’s regime fell and the militia leaders were just beginning their new round of conflict among themselves, it would have been hard to anticipate the Taliban emerging and sweeping to power as it soon would. In Syria, violent extremism bred by chaos and conflict after the fall of Raqqa may take non-ISIS forms for which we do not yet have a label.
Most important, later problems and security threats have resulted from prolongation of the armed conflict itself, not from specific participants in that conflict winning or losing, or seeing their influence expand or contract. In Afghanistan in the early 1990s, it was not the fortunes of any one warlord or militia that defined the country’s political and security future. It was the violent quarrel among them that gave the Taliban their opening.

The Taliban would not have had their opportunity if power-sharing had been fully and faithfully implemented. In Syria, we already have seen a similar dynamic, in which it was the civil war itself, not the existence of a specific regime or its longstanding foreign alliances, that gave ISIS the opening to score its dramatic gains. The same can be expected with any post-ISIS radical movements.
Despite the differences between the two cases, a major conclusion applying to both is that minimizing future security problems requires de-escalation and accommodation, not prolongation of warfare and mission creep. This specifically means not using the occasion of victory over one enemy to get in some whacks against someone else one considers an adversary.
From the mid-1990s, the subsequent few years of Afghan history saw Al Qaeda’s alliance with the Taliban, 9/11, and a direct U.S. military intervention beginning in late 2001 and continuing, seemingly without end, today. One endless war, with a changing cast of adversaries, is too much; the United States does not need another one in Syria.

Germany Just Banned Pork. Take A Wild Guess Why They Did It.,"German liberals are still bending over backward to appease Muslim refugees. Salzburg has gone so far that it wouldn’t be surprising if the mayor starts advocating for forced conversions. Pork is now banned at multiple city-run schools.
“The office of the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) deputy mayor Anja Hagenaue confirmed the accusations saying that while there was no official order given by the left wing government, the ban had been in place for around five years. Ms. Hagenaue added the children preferred chicken and carrots to pork.”
Really? Arguing that schoolchildren don’t like pork is quite a stretch. U.S. markets are saturated with bacon-flavored products, with everything from chapstick to candles being sold. Austrian stores have less variety but pork is still heavily featured in local cuisine.
Students who desire pork-free meals should bring their own lunches or work out an agreement with their schools. It’s not unreasonable for a school to expand its lunchroom options but students shouldn’t have to suffer because another child’s family has different beliefs.
“ServusTV…questioned the parents of children attending kindergartens in Salzburg. They told the channel they rejected the fact pork was excluded and the channel commissioned a nationwide survey that showed 78 percent of Austrians thought pork should be included in all kindergartens.”
Once a society starts capitulating to Islam’s demands, it’s already on the road to ruin. Now, the kids can’t eat pork. Next, boys and girls will have to be kept apart because otherwise Muslim parents will be dissatisfied.
Austria was initially reluctant to accept migrants, and Salzburg’s policy demonstrates why. Already locals are being asked to stifle their desire in order to make the migrants happy. Whether or not students are fed pork at school might seem like a minor issue, but the government, once encouraged, is unlikely to stop implementing more restrictions.","Yes, I’m Right",1
"Perry touts energy exports, awaits study on electric grid","APJuly 18, 2017, 12:44 PM
 
Energy Secretary Rick Perry says the Trump administration is pushing for increased exports of natural gas and other energy sources as its seeks U.S. ""energy dominance"" in the global market.
Perry said he and President Donald Trump have offered a ""comforting"" message to energy companies seeking to export liquefied natural gas: ""If you meet the rules, here's your permit.""
Perry also touted increased U.S. oil and coal exports to boost energy production and jobs.
Perry said Tuesday he hasn't seen a widely expected department study into the reliability of the electric grid. A draft version leaked to news outlets indicates that renewable power and federal regulations have had little impact on reliability.

Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., suggested Thursday that the media played a role in sparking President Trump's recent attacks against Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
In an interview with CNN, Brat responded to a question as to whether he believes the media forced Trump to tweet his criticisms of Sessions, as he's done the last four days.
""I think you did,"" Brat said on CNN when asked if the press essentially forced Trump to attack Sessions by covering Russia's election meddling so much.
""You got 24/7 coverage, and he doesn't have an attorney general in place to cover the most important issue that the media covers with 90 percent of your coverage,"" Brat said. ""The anchors across the mainstream media, you guys are good, you're fair to me. … But some of the others are just relentless.""
""I will concede the president did touch his keypad."" As far as @RepDaveBrat will go on Trump v Sessions. Wild.https://t.co/HHZpvxYFtz— Kate Bolduan (@KateBolduan) July 27, 2017
When pressed by CNN on whether Brat truly believes the press pushed Trump to issue several public condemnations of Sessions, the Virginia Republican said the media contributed to Trump's frustration.
""I'm using ‘force' in a bank shot metaphor,"" he said. ""You didn't coerce him, but you made him frustrated.""
""He is frustrated because he does not have an attorney general at the highest level who can respond to the key issue that the media is grilling him on all day,"" he continued. ""In politics, sometimes you've got to do politics, so I think that's the source of the frustration.""
Brat did concede that it was the president, not the media, who was sending out the slew of tweets over the last four days criticizing Sessions for a host of issues.
The president first began airing his grievances against the attorney general last week when, in an interview with the New York Times, Trump said he wouldn't have selected Sessions for attorney general if he knew he was going to recuse himself from the Russia probe.
Trump has since tweeted about Sessions over the last few days. He called him ""beleaguered,"" and suggested the former Alabama senator should investigate Hillary Clinton, and questioned why he didn't fire acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.
In a press conference in the Rose Garden on Tuesday, Trump said he was disappointed in Sessions, and wants him to pursue leaks from the intelligence community that have plagued the Trump administration.

BREAKING: California Democrats Just RUINED The State FOR GOOD- Look What They Secretly Did While You Were Sleeping,"Dean James III% AMERICA’S FREEDOM FIGHTERS –
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California’s signature initiative to fight global warming will get another decade of life after lawmakers from both parties joined Gov. Jerry Brown in extending the law credited with reducing the state’s carbon footprint, CBS reported.
Monday night’s votes to renew California’s cap-and-trade program bolster the Democratic governor’s quest to portray the state as a leader in the fight against climate change. At a bipartisan celebratory press conference following the vote, members from both parties noted the contrast with Washington, where Republicans have struggled to pass legislation and have taken a skeptical view of regulations to combat greenhouse gases.
Brown’s signature will add another decade of life to the state’s cap-and-trade program, bolstering the Democratic governor’s quest to portray California as a leader in the fight against climate change at a time when President Donald Trump is pulling back.
“Tonight, California stood tall and once again, boldly confronted the existential threat of our time,” Brown said in a statement after the vote. “Republicans and Democrats set aside their differences, came together and took courageous action. That’s what good government looks like.”
“We didn’t come here to Sacramento to just be Republicans and to hate on Democrats,” Assembly Republican Leader Chad Mayes said. “We came here to Sacramento to make people’s lives better.”
The three-bill package now heads to Brown’s desk.
Brown has sought to offer the state’s cap-and-trade program as a model that can be reproduced in other states and even nations to reduce carbon emissions and combat rising temperatures.
“We’re only 1 percent of the problem, but we’re a lot more a part of the solution,” Brown said. “It’s not just what we do – it’s what other people can follow.”
CBS Sacramento reports Brown said carbon dioxide emissions are “not a local issue. They’re a global issue.”
Brown sounded an apocalyptic tone in a rare personal appeal before a Senate committee last week, telling lawmakers that failing to pass the extension would lead to fires, disease and mass migration, not to mention higher costs for food and gasoline, Fox News reported.
Republicans likened the bill to a tax that will hit Californians at the gas pump and the grocery store. The nonpartisan legislative analyst said last year that the existing cap and trade program accounted for an 11-cent-per-gallon increase in gasoline prices. The office has not analyzed the extension proposal.
“We could shut down the entire state of California and it would have absolutely no effect on the global climate,” said Sen. Andy Vidak, a Republican from Hanford in the agricultural Central Valley. “But what is measureable is the effect this tax will have on the poorest of the poor in my district and across California.”
So there you have it. More insanity from Commiefornia. What a freaking mess.

"Trump launches personal attack on ‘crazy, low IQ’ female journalist","Washington – President Donald Trump on Thursday launched a brutal personal attack on MSNBC journalist Mika Brzezinski, after she sharply criticized his administration’s dysfunction in a segment on her show.
“I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don’t watch anymore),” Trump wrote, referring to a morning news show featuring Brzezinski and co-host Joe Scarborough.
“Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year’s Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!” Trump tweeted.
The president, an avid cable news watcher, appears to have been responding to sharp comments by Brzezinski during Thursday “Morning Joe” program on the left-leaning MSNBC cable network.
“Everybody in Washington,” Brzezinski said, “in the administration, needs to look at this from…a point of view where they’re not lobotomized because you’re sitting in there and you’re so scared of him, and you think you need to suck up to the president.”

Muslims DEMAND Sharia Law In America – Should We Deport Them?,"A majority of Muslims in the United States are demanding that we bring Sharia law to America. (via Blue Vision).
The big question people seem to have is, should these people be deported? The obvious answer is, OF COURSE they should be deported!
The truth is plain and simple. Islamic law is DANGEROUS, particularly in the context of our laws. When you look at the teachings of the Koran, it is clear that this type of behavior is not acceptable in our culture.
We need to take a stand now against the Muslims that believe that we need to incorporate Sharia Law into the United States. Luckily, we know that our president is not going to stand for this nonsense. He would never let us make Sharia law the law of the land.
If you couple that factor with the action President Trump is taking against the terrorists that have been trying to weasel their way into our country, it is safe to say that we can rest easy.
The best thing that we can do at this point is make people aware of the dangers of Sharia law and let them know that it will not be accepted here. It is never going to take effect here.

He’s 71, holds down an incredibly stressful job, and is overweight. He doesn’t exercise. His eating habits are less than ideal. And to top it all off, he doesn’t get enough sleep.
For anyone walking into a doctor’s office with those symptoms, stern warnings and lifestyle changes are sure to follow.
But President Trump’s attitude toward diet and exercise isn’t simply a personal issue. It resonates in his policies on public health. Already his administration has relaxed nutritional standards on school lunches and he has yet to name any members of the president’s fitness council.
It could also impact his judgment. USA TODAY reported recently that neurologists say Trump shows most symptoms of sleep deprivation — including diminished cognition and anxiety — and a June report shows exercise is the single best medicine for a good night’s sleep.
Stress is likely what ages presidents the most, says physician Anupam Jena, a Harvard Medical School health care policy professor and author of a study on politicians' mortality rates.
“Trump has got an awful lot of stress with whatever’s going to happen with the Russian probe,"" says Jena.
Jena’s 2015 study looked at the mortality rates of politicians from around the world and found their life expectancy was 2.7 years shorter than the person who failed to beat them in an election.
Jena, an internal medicine doctor, says healthy eating, increased exercise and a good night's sleep are the key ways political leaders can offset their risk of an early death.
Those who know Trump, including physicians, say they aren't worried about him.
""The guy is not a health nut, but he's always in motion,"" says Chris Ruddy, the CEO of the media company Newsmax, who has known Trump for 20 years.

Ruddy says Trump will often chide him if he ""needs to lose a few pounds,"" and is always monitoring his own weight.
After he was the target of jokes for eating pizza with a fork in 2011, Trump declared he could more easily eat just the cheese if he used utensils.
""I like to not eat the crust so we can keep the weight down at least as good as possible,"" he said.
Washington cardiologist Ramin Oskoui also advised Trump on health care policy during the campaign and reviewed Trump's medical information last year. He concluded that the data ""seemed fairly reassuring. He has high cholesterol and was taking appropriate medication.""
""He seems to have gotten good care and followed the recommendations of his Internist,"" Oskoui said in an email. ""While the records were brief, they were pretty reasonably straight-forward and transparent. I wouldn't say the same thing about [Democratic nominee Hillary] Clinton.""
Harold Bornstein, Trump's doctor until he started using White House physician Ronny Jackson this year, said he wrote Trump's health report in five minutes and used the president’s “kind of language.”
Even if Bornstein was embellishing to the degree his patient prefers, medical experts consulted by USA TODAY say Trump's approach to food and fitness are frightening for 71-year-old man under his amount of stress.
""Do I worry he’s going to have a heart attack or stroke in office?"" asks Cleveland Clinic physician and diet book author Michael Roizen. ""From a medical standpoint, you would worry about that.""
No fan of fitness
Trump believes everyone has a finite amount of energy to use throughout his or her lifetime, so he doesn't exercise beyond playing golf while riding a cart. He is best known as a fan of fast food, which he has discussed often in media interviews, or higher-end burgers at his country clubs, which Ruddy confirms.
Regardless of her patients’ sleep problems, Maryland sleep medicine doctor and neurologist Helene Emsellem says appointments “invariably include a discussion of diet and exercise"" as they try to solve them.
Despite its sleep-inducing qualities, Trump has stated openly that excercise is overrated, even going so far as to say that it can create more problems than it cures.
‘‘All my friends who work out all the time, they’re going for knee replacements, hip replacements — they’re a disaster,’’ Trump said in a September 2015 New York Times Magazine article.

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, an informal adviser to the president, finds Trump's aversion to actual exercise irrelevant.
""Donald Trump is one of the those people who is genetically disposed to have high energy,"" says Gingrich, who lauded Trump's frequent golf outings. Trump travels the course at a rapid pace, he said.
Golfing also keeps him from eating. Ruddy says Trump once told him: ""You'll love golf — four hours when you're not eating or thinking about food.""
Playing golf while riding a cart burns only about half as many calories than walking, or an average of 411 calories for nine holes, according to a study by Neal Wolkendoff of the Colorado Center for Health and Sport Science.
Golf = one piece of KFC
That's about the same calories in one extra crispy Kentucky Fried Chicken breast. It's also just under what Trump burns with three hours of sleep, says neurologist William Winter, author of The Sleep Solution.
""For Trump, his lack of sleep can create problems with his weight"" and metabolism, says Winter. Sleep deprivation suppresses the chemical leptin, which makes us feel full.
""This will have the effect of making POTUS eat more to feel full,"" says Winter.
The White House doesn't comment on how often Trump golfs. Politifact, which has been tracking Trump's golf through public sightings and other reports, says the president has golfed 19 times between his inauguration and July 5. (The site also compares Trump to former President Barack Obama, who golfed eight times at this point in his presidency.)
The Department of Health and Human Services and its President’s Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition recommends 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity, or a combination of the two every week.
But that predated Trump’s administration, which has allowed the President’s Council to languish. “To be announced” is all the site says under members and leadership. Former California governor, Mr. Universe and recent Trump nemesis Arnold Schwarzenegger is an ex-chairman of the council.
Conversely, President George W. Bush, who WebMD called “President Buff,” used the elliptical machine two days, lifted weights two days, ran four miles four days and did “lots of stretching"" in a typical week, according to information released by the White House during his administration. He was also an avid cyclist.
Obama worked out for about 45 minutes for six days a week, alternating between cardio-strength training and weightlifting, according to Men's Health which dubbed him one of their ""Heroes of Health and Fitness"" in 2015.
Diet and exercise were also former first lady Michelle Obama's signature issues. As the fitness council lay dormant, Trump's Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue relaxed the nutritional standards for school lunches and delayed deadlines for adherence, notes nutrition expert and author Marion Nestle, a New York University professor.
""One of the things Michelle Obama did was exert an enormous moral force for keeping kids healthy,"" says Nestle. ""These things have to be changed at societal level and it’s really nice if you have a government that promotes it.""
While he was president, Bill Clinton came the closest to what Gingrich calls Trump's ""middle American eating habits."" Like Trump, Clinton also didn't drink alcohol.
Clinton, however, ""ran with the Secret Service agents five days a week,"" says Roizen.
At 71, Trump is also considerably older than his predecessors, but that doesn't mean he is supposed to exercise any less. It does mean he's in step with other 70-somethings. Roizen says less than 1% of adults aged 65 do the basic level of recommended exercise, which includes cardio, resistance training and walking about 10,000 steps a day.
Trump has talked often of his love of fast food. Gingrich reiterated what has been written in the past about Trump's attraction to both fast food and hygiene.
""It’s definable,"" Gingrich says of fast food. ""He's looking for consistency and reliability.""
Trump and now-First Lady Melania Trump appeared on a video on Martha Stewart's website in 2006 as Stewart prepared ""Donald's favorite sandwich"" — meat loaf.
The food choices on Trump's campaign plane reported by the New York Times included chateaubriand, shrimp cocktail, chicken, sea bass and potatoes au gratin. Trump chose liberally from the potatoes and shrimp that day.
One of the few recent Trump meals journalists have reported on — a May 8 dinner attended by three Time correspondents — included two scoops of ice cream with pie for him, one for everyone else and a fruit plate for Vice President Pence. Trump also got an extra side of sauce for his chicken.
White House and former Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks declined to respond to questions about Trump's health, beyond sending the link to an article about the president now using the White House physician.
While many have noted Trump already looks like the presidency has taken a toll on him, Gingrich isn't one of them.
""I think he looks he’s having the time of his life,"" says Gingrich. ""My hunch is it won’t age Donald Trump at all.""

"Former US diplomat endorses India US relationship, says Trump administration recognises India as partner of strategic importance","India and the United States have much to gain by collaborating and further deepening of the defense and intelligence and cyber security partnership, former US diplomat added. (Reuters)
The Trump administration fundamentally recognises India as a partner of strategic importance, a former American diplomat has said in an apparent endorsement of the Indo-US relationship under the new government. “The Trump administration, as in the prior administration during the tenure of President (Barack) Obama, fundamentally recognises India’s strategic importance as a partner, India’s importance as a country that espouses the same values, goals, and objectives of a rules based international order, and also India’s important and growing capabilities as a net security provider,” former Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia, Nisha Desai Biswal said.
The Obama administration made a big bet on India in terms of India as a strategic partner across the Indian Ocean and across the Indo-Pacific, said Biswal. “I think that the Trump administration will continue that. We’ve seen that, in terms of some of the pronouncements that we’re seeing on the defence partnership as well,” Biswal told PTI.
According to her, one of the hallmark of Indo-US relationship in the past two decades has been the bipartisan support it attracts in the US. Improving and strengthening ties with India has been a national security and foreign policy priority of every US president since Bill Clinton, which continued with his successors George W Bush and Barack Obama.
The successful meeting between the US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington last month is further indication of that, she said.
“I think the Prime Minister’s visit to Washington went off quite well. Both sides were fairly judicious about keeping expectations low, and about quieting some of the areas of friction in an advance of the visit,” Biswal said.
According to her, the first ever meeting between the two leaders, set in motion the trajectory of India-US relationship for the next four years. It also resulted in US approving a long pending Indian request of sale of unmanned drones to India. The meeting, Biswal noted, created an opportunity for the two leaders and the two teams to be able to spend a fair bit of time.
“It was important in allowing the relationship to take hold in the new American administration,” she said. “It was important and consequential in continuing to advance the strategic and security relationship, and also in underlining the importance of working through some of the areas of competition or tension on the economic side,” she added.
“We both obviously have very complex economies. We have very important domestic, political, and economic constituencies that we have to manage, and jobs in America and jobs in India are both very important to both leaders,” Biswal said.

"In a World of Disarray, Africa Is Taking Steps Forward","The Middle East should not be the sole focus of America's foreign policy.
At this juncture in mid-2017, while the Middle East remains highly turbulent and global security challenges remain acute from Korea and East Asia to Ukraine and Afghanistan, what is the state of security in Africa? A continent of fifty-four nations, ranging from the Arab regions of the north to the Sahel region and a number of subzones in Sub-Saharan Africa, there are of course many stories to tell. But three stand out. The net assessment for the continent as a whole, while far from rosy, has a number of promising dimensions.
Africa's security situation might be summarized as follows:
First is the state of terrorism and extremism. This remains a tough and disturbing story, overall. Countries from Mali to Libya to Somalia have been afflicted, by Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, ISIS, and Al-Shabaab among the key perpetrators. Terrorist attacks have also occurred in places such as Kenya and Burkina Faso. It is hard to talk of improvement in any of these places. At least things are not getting worse on balance. Indeed, there has perhaps even some slight improvement in Nigeria in particular, where the fight against Boko Haram continues (and occasionally spills over slightly into neighboring countries like Cameroon), but where the International Institute for Strategic Studies reports a reduced fatality rate relative to 2015.
Second is the state of civil war and famine in several key countries in the general east-west swath of land that includes the semi-arid Sahel region of Africa. This is a tragedy happening before our eyes in real time. It involves a belt of nations overlapping with some of the countries suffering from terrorism and extremism. The Sudans, Central African Republic, Somalia and Nigeria are among the worst hit, with parts of these countries collectively now containing more than 15 million people at acute risk of starvation. Beyond the specific risks from famine, South Sudan continues to devour itself in pointless and petty violence that involves huge numbers of sexual crimes as well.
Other conflict zones in this swath of countries may be faring slightly better. Sudan does not have the degree of infighting it suffered a decade ago, even if it is far from peaceful. On June 19 of this year, the Central African Republic’s government and thirteen of the fourteen armed groups in the country signed an accord to end ethnic and religious conflict. However, it is too soon to know if this will lead to a meaningful trend towards stability.
Third is the continent writ large, encompassing the majority of the nations in Africa. Most of it is more peaceful that it has been, on average, since the waves of independence in the late 1950s and 1960s or during most of the Cold War and then the 1990s. On balance, Africa is slightly more stable (and somewhat more democratic) than ever before in modern times.
Of course, this is a provisional judgment—and whatever peace may be breaking out coexists near lots of ongoing conflict and also requires many peacekeepers to sustain. Indeed, there are currently eight United Nations peacekeeping operations in Africa: UNMISS in South Sudan, UNISFA in the disputed Abyei region, UNAMID in Darfur, MONUSCO in the Democratic Republic of Congo, MINUSCA in Central African Republic, MINUSMA in Mali, UNMIL in Liberia and finally MINURSO in Western Sahara. Overall, there are over 92,000 personnel serving in UN peacekeeping operations in Africa.
In addition to collaborating with the UN in Darfur, the African Union has two active peace operations: AMISOM in Somalia, and the Regional Cooperation Initiative for the Elimination of the Lord’s Resistance Army (RCI-LRA). There are over 22,000 deployed AMISOM personnel, with most of its troops coming from Uganda, Burundi, Djibouti, Kenya, Ethiopia and Sierra Leone. RCI-LRA has a Regional Task Force of over 3,000 soldiers from Uganda, South Sudan, DRC and CAR.
Political tensions over transfers of power, or more commonly, the absence of a transfer of power, make things dicey in several other countries, too. Too many leaders are holding onto power indefinitely, either through sham elections or no real elections at all, or the dominance of political organization and process in their respective countries that allows them to get elected more or less indefinitely. Not only DRC and Burundi, but Rwanda, Uganda, Zimbabwe and Angola are notable examples of this dangerous trend. Even in a relatively benign case like Paul Kagame’s Rwanda, where the strongman leader has undoubtedly delivered much for his country, the tendency towards a “presidency for life” pattern of behavior puts democracy—and national stability—at risk.
Indeed, eight presidents in Africa have now amassed more than 229 years in power between them. These include: Eduardo dos Santos from Angola (thirty-seven), Teodoro Obiang Nguema from Equatorial Guinea (thirty-seven), Paul Biya from Cameroon (thirty-three), Idriss Deby from Chad (twenty-six), Denis Sassou-Nguesso of Congo-Brazzaville (thirty-two), Yoweri Museveni of Uganda (thirty-one), Paul Kagame of Rwanda (seventeen) and Joseph Kabila of the DRC (sixteen). Beyond just these cases, Africa’s trend towards democracy, after an impressive period of improvement in the 1990s and 2000s, has plateaued: Freedom House ranked four African countries as free in 1998, eleven as free in 2007, but only ten as free in 2016.

"Russian lawyer ""ready"" to testify about Trump Jr. meeting","CBS/APJuly 19, 2017, 10:19 AM
 
In this photo taken on Tue., Nov. 8, 2016, Kremlin-linked lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya speaks to a journalist in Moscow, Russia.
The Russian lawyer who met with President Donald Trump's eldest son during the 2016 election campaign says in an interview aired Wednesday that she's ready to testify before the U.S. Senate.
Natalia Veselnitskaya said in an interview with Kremlin-funded RT television that she's ""ready to clarify the situation behind the mass hysteria, but only through lawyers or testifying in the Senate.""
Donald Trump Jr. agreed to meet with Veselnitskaya in June 2016 after being told that she could provide incriminating information about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The meeting had been billed as part of a Russian government effort to help the Republican's White House campaign.
In the lengthy interview with RT, Veselnitskaya was dismissive of the tumult in the U.S. surrounding her meeting with Trump campaign officials, and she denied again links with top Russian government officials close to President Vladimir Putin.
Asked directly whether she was prepared to testify to members of the U.S. Congress, Veselnitskaya said she was ready to do so, ""if I'm guaranteed safety. Because today I have to think about my safety first and foremost, about the safety of my family and my four children.""
Bill Browder on past dealings with Russian lawyer in Trump Jr. meeting
American businessman Bill Browder, who was once the biggest foreign investors in Russia, has since become a vocal critic of the country and has c...
She called the controversy a ""very well-orchestrated story concocted by one particular manipulator,"" whom she identified repeatedly as American businessman Bill Browder.
Browder was once the biggest foreign investor in Russia, but he has since become a vocal critic of the country's leadership and has clashed with Putin's inner circle.
Browder was a driving force behind the Magnitsky Act, a U.S. law passed in 2012 that imposes economic sanctions and travel restrictions on Russians named as human rights abusers. Browder believes it is Putin's No. 1 priority to get the U.S. to lift the sanctions imposed under the act, which currently affect 44 Russians.
In her interview with Russian government-funded RT, Veselnitskaya called Browder ""one of the greatest experts in the field of manipulating the mass media,"" and said she had ""no doubt that this whole information campaign is being spun, encouraged and organized by that very man as revenge"" for a legal settlement earlier this year which effectively saw his efforts to expose alleged Russian money-laundering in the U.S. hit a brick wall.
During Browder's appearance on ""CBS This Morning"" Tuesday, co-host Charlie Rose called attention to Browder's description of Veselnitskaya as ""probably the most aggressive person I have ever encountered in all of my contacts with Russians"" — to which Browder replied, ""Yes, she's a remarkable person. I should caveat that: she's not aggressive in a physical way.""
Eighth person in Trump Tower meeting identified
CBS News has confirmed that Ike Kaveladze, a Soviet-born businessman who came to the U.S. in 1991, was the eighth person who attended Donald Trum...
When asked if he believed there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to impact the American election, Browder replied: ""I have no idea. All I can say is I know the Russian side intimately and I can tell you this was a highly resourced operation to get rid of a piece of legislation that would affect Vladimir Putin personally.""
Mr. Trump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort also took part in the meeting at Trump Tower. CBS News confirmed on Tuesday that Ike Kaveladze -- a Soviet-born businessman who came to the U.S. in 1991 -- was also at the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower, along with Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist.
Following Donald Trump Jr.'s release of emails about the gathering, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, said that he wants to hear from ""everyone in that meeting"" to get their version of the story.
""I think we may find out there may have been other meetings as well. We don't know that yet. But what we've seen is a constant effort to hide contacts with Russians. We've seen this pattern repeat itself,"" Warner said on CBS's ""Face the Nation.""
Warner, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Trump Jr.'s own emails represented the first time the public had seen what he called ""clear evidence"" that there was a Russian government effort to undermine the Clinton campaign and help the Trump campaign in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Five sentenced to days in jail for Supreme Court disruption over campaign finance,"Supreme Court justices are, seated from left, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Anthony M. Kennedy, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., Clarence Thomas, Stephen Breyer, and, standing from left, Elena Kagan, Samuel Alito Jr., Sonia Sotomayor and Neil M. Gorsuch. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)
Five protesters who disrupted a session of the U.S. Supreme Court by shouting disapproval of its rulings on campaign finance law were sentenced to either one or two weekends in prison Monday after losing a bid to overturn a 1949 law restricting public protest at the court.
U.S. prosecutors had asked U.S. District Judge Christopher R. “Casey” Cooper in Washington to order 10-day jail sentences for the defendants, members of an organization called 99Rise. They had stood and spoke one-by-one just after the court was gaveled into session April 1, 2015, about a year after the justices struck down overall limits on campaign contributions.
“Money is not speech. One person, one vote!” shouted defendant Matthew Kresling, 43, of Los Angeles, before being led away in 2015. David Bronstein, 30, of the District, sang, “We who believe in freedom shall not rest.” A third defendant demanded the court overturn its campaign finance decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.
[Law restricting protests during Supreme Court proceedings is upheld]
Cooper said he appreciated the defendants’ commitment, public participation and community contributions, and that the sentence had nothing to do with their views or exercise of free speech, only “how, where and when” they exercised that right.
“Courtrooms are special public forums,” Cooper said, drawing power and legitimacy not from police powers or the power of the purse like the other branches of government, but from what Cooper described as the “law and mutual respect” of the judicial process.
The Supreme Court embodies the “legitimacy and independence of the federal judiciary, and that legitimacy is undermined when rules and traditions are flouted, even for a cause that you believe is just,” the judge said.
Cooper also said the same group behind the protest, now known as Democracy Spring, had disrupted the court three times over a period of about a year, and that defendants in the first two cases were not sentenced to additional jail time.
In seeking jail time, Assistant U.S. attorney Lisa Nicole Waters called politically-charged speeches and “theatrics” a threat to the justice system’s integrity and impartiality.
Jail time “will promote respect for the law because it will send a clear message that this type of disruptive, uncontrollable conduct will not be tolerated,” Waters wrote in court filings.
Immediately after the protests, a court audio recording captured Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. saying, “Oh, please,” and Justice Antonin Scalia grumbling, “Give them stiff, stiff sentences.”
[Protest at the Supreme Court. Only problem? Few reporters were there to see it.]
Defendants, who pleaded guilty May 4, had asked to be sentenced to the 30 hours of jail time they had served after their arrest, and after Monday’s sentencing voiced sentiments ranging from relief to irritation at the government resources spent on the case against them.
Cooper sentenced Kresling to two weekends in prison citing an additional recent arrest in a protest at a Pennsylvania state lawmaker’s office. The four others each received a sentence of one weekend. All five were ordered to stay away from the Supreme Court for one year.
In a statement he posted online and read in court, Kresling called it a paradox that the law the protesters were charged with violating was written to prevent groups such as the Ku Klux Klan from attempting to intimidate courts and juries.
By contrast, he said, he and his friends intended to speak out for average citizens who now think American democracy is rigged by a controlling, moneyed elite of wealthy donors.
“If we’d truly wished to intimidate the court, everyone knows that the best way to do it would have been to make massive contributions, in one form or another, to a politician who would subsequently make or approve judiciary appointments favorable to our interests,” Kresling wrote in his prepared statement. “That’s how modern Klans, in their various guises, influence the court in our time, when money is speech and mere speaking, apparently, is criminal.”
Kai Newkirk, organizer of Democracy Spring, said after the sentencing that the group has no current plans to disrupt the high court, but will continue nonviolent protests to encourage Americans to take actions with their legislatures to pass reforms of campaign finance and voting access laws.

Understanding the Chinese-Russian alliance,"Analysis, Latest, News, Report Russia
 
Alexander Mercouris4 hours agoJuly 4, 2017 99
The summit meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Putin in advance of the G20 meeting in Hamburg is the latest expression of the Chinese-Russian alliance which is reshaping the modern world.
As my colleague Adam Garrie has rightly written, the meetings yesterday and today in Moscow between Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia are far more important than any of the other bilateral meetings which will be taking place this week during the G20 summit in Hamburg.
Unfortunately that includes the ill-starred meeting between President Putin and President Trump.
This is the 21st meeting between Presidents Xi and Putin since President Xi became China’s leader when he was elected General Secretary of China’s Communist Party in November 2012 and became China’s President in March 2013.
I do not think that there has ever in history been such intense interaction between two leaders of two Great Powers. Moreover we see only the tip of the iceberg. As I have discussed previously, the Kremlin website never publishes details of President Putin’s telephone conversations with President Xi, though it is a certainty that they happen regularly. Given the intensity of their other interactions I would not be surprised if they speak at least once a month. Probably there is a regular schedule for their calls.
The key point about President Xi’s and President Putin’s latest meeting is that over and above the various economic agreements they are clearly coordinating their positions in advance of what is likely to be a difficult G20 summit for them both.
President Xi will be looking for President Putin’s support in his almost certainly fraught conversations with President Trump on the North Korean issue. It is known that Trump and Xi had what appears to have been a difficult telephone conversation a few days ago, during which Xi warned Trump of the ongoing deterioration of their relations. Here is how the Financial Times reports it
China’s president has warned Donald Trump of “negative factors” emerging in their bilateral relationship just hours after Beijing lashed out at Washington for sending a navy destroyer near a disputed island in the South China Sea. The message from Xi Jinping, made in a phone conversation with Mr Trump on Monday morning, came after the White House took a series of moves that have angered Beijing, including a $1.4bn arms sale to Taiwan and imposing sanctions on a Chinese bank for doing business with North Korea.
President Putin for his part will be looking to President Xi for support against the pressure he is likely to come under from the Western powers in respect of the Syrian and Ukrainian crises.
The two Presidents will no doubt also have much to say to each other about their respectively complex relations with India, which under Prime Minister Modi’s leadership is actively manoeuvring for advantage between the great power blocs: the Western alliance and the Russian-Chinese alliance. I have previously set out my own views about the reasons for Prime Minister Modi’s recent actions here. Suffice to say that I do not think that they imply any abandonment by India of its traditional policy of non-alignment or of its BRICS partners or that they portend an alliance between India and the US.
Obviously Xi and Putin would support each other on all these questions even if they had not had a prior meeting. However prior coordination is always useful, and besides one of the purposes of the Xi-Putin meeting in Moscow is precisely to signal to the other powers the closeness between China and Russia and the fact that this coordination is taking place.
All of this brings us back to the nature of the relationship between China and Russia. I discussed this all in a lengthy article I wrote for   exactly a year ago. Rather than repeat what I wrote there – in which I discussed the way in which China and Russia are now allies and the impact this alliance is having on international relations – I propose simply to repost this article, with a few annotations bringing it up to date
This article was first published by   on 5th July 2016
Though it has received minimal attention in the West, last week Putin completed his 15th visit to China where he held intensive talks with the Chinese leadership led by Chinese President Xi Jinping.
This came directly after Putin met Xi Jinping at the immediately preceding Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tashkent. According to Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang, whom Putin also met in Beijing, Xi Jinping has met Putin more often than he has met any other foreign leader.
On the Russian side the talks between Putin and the Chinese leadership in Beijing did not involve Putin alone. Putin’s meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing started as a one-to-one meeting with just the two leaders and their interpreters present. It was then expanded to include top officials and ministers of both the Russian and Chinese governments.
Whilst we do not know the details of the topics which were discussed – and Putin and Xi Jinping avoided discussing them in open press conferences – the information we have suggests that the talks were very detailed and very wide-ranging:
“Documents signed include a declaration between Russia and China on raising the role of international law, intergovernmental agreements on cooperation on joint implementation of a programme to develop, produce, commercialise and organise after-sales service of a wide-bodied, long-haul plane and development of further models based on this plane, cooperation on a programme to build a heavy helicopter, cooperation on technology protection measures related to work together on exploring and using outer space for peaceful purposes and developing and operating launch systems and ground-based space infrastructure, and an appendix to an agreement on cooperation on building a nuclear power plant on Chinese territory and on Russia according China a state loan.
Other agreements concern coordination of joint efforts within international groups and organisations, cooperation in the forestry sector, innovation sector, securities market regulation, insurance, cooperation on localising production of high-speed rolling stock and railway equipment on Russian territory, cooperation in the oil and gas sector, cooperation between the two countries’ media outlets, and sports sector cooperation.
Also signed was a joint declaration between the Eurasian Economic Union Commission and the Chinese Ministry of Commerce on the official start of talks on an agreement on trade and economic cooperation between the Eurasian Economic Union and the People’s Republic of China.”
The last paragraph makes clear that the Chinese not only received Putin as the President of Russia. They also received him as the de facto leader of the Eurasian Economic Union, an organisation the Western media never reports about and which as far as the Western media is concerned might as well not exist.
(Since this was written Chinese Russian industrial and technological has forged further forward. The Russians and the Chinese have largely completed studies on their new joint short to medium range wide body aircraft of which a model has now been displayed.
The new aircraft will use mainly Russian technology including Russian engines – almost certainly the new Kuznetsov PD30 – but will be built by a factory in China as part of a joint venture between the two countries)
The official communiques say nothing about defence and foreign policy discussions but we can sure they took place and that the full range of international relations – Ukraine, Syria, North Korea, the South China Sea, arms control, defence etc – were discussed, as were the various projects for building a new global financial architecture independent of the US and the dollar, which the Chinese especially are pressing ahead with. Almost certainly the reason why the Russian and Chinese leaders did not engage with the international media following their discussions is because they did not want to be asked questions about the discussions they had on these topics.
(From a Western point of view by far the most alarming single development in terms of Chinese Russian military cooperation is the recent announcement of joint Chinese Russian military exercises in the Baltic Sea – the prime flashpoint between Russia and NATO. Andrey Denisov, Russia’s ambassador to China, recently spoke about these exercises with his tongue firmly in his cheek
There is a point of novelty, but I haven’t heard anyone expressing much concern over this so-called ‘threat.’ The Baltic States repeat their usual incantations, but at the same time, they take for granted the fact that NATO is deploying large forces on their territory….Those who are scared off are inclined to being scared. For instance, I have seen an article on the internet, written by some Swedish military analysts. They say that they see no threat in it. The main thing is that rules concerning such events should be respected.
In reality, as everyone knows, a Chinese military presence in the Baltic allied to Russia is a NATO planner’s ultimate nightmare. The planned Russian-Chinese exercises in the Baltic have now brought it one step closer to becoming a reality)
I do not know of cooperation between any two other Great Powers in the world today which is so close. Contrary to what is often said, cooperation between Russia and China today at a political and military-strategic level is very much closer today than it was in the days of their formal alliance in the 1950s, when meetings between Soviet and Chinese leaders were infrequent and frequently tense.
Whilst economic and technological relations between the two countries are still lagging, they are – as the communiques show – developing rapidly. By way of example and contrary to some media claims, the two countries are forging ahead with their pipeline projects, which are in active construction. Claims by some Western and pro-Western Russian liberal commentators that they will never be built are wishful thinking.
(In monetary terms the value of Russian-Chinese trade has now recovered to 2013 levels ie. to the levels before the crash in oil prices halved the value of Russia’s exports, despite the fact that oil prices have failed to recover to previous levels. Volumes of traded goods are however now much higher than in 2013. Russia is now China’s biggest supplier of oil. The value of China’s and Russia’s trade will leap higher once the new projects eg. the Power of Siberia pipeline and the new industrial projects like the joint project for a wide bodied aircraft come into effect)
Beyond these bilateral questions there are the greater plans which Putin discussed at SPIEF 2016 for the Eurasian Economic Union and China to conclude free trade agreements with each other, with Russia and China working to merge the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union and the Chinese-led Silk Road Project into a single whole as part of their joint “Greater Eurasia” project in which they ultimately want to involve Europe too.
(The Chinese media has said that one of President Xi’s goals at the G20 summit is to impress on the German leadership – not just the political leadership but its business community as well – the importance of linking up to these projects).
All this is only the visible tip of the iceberg of Russian-Chinese relations. As I have discussed previously, there are certain to be scores of secret agreements between the Chinese and the Russians we know nothing about: to share intelligence (including for example signals intelligence and data from satellites) and to coordinate foreign policy and for defence cooperation including technology sharing. We know for example that the Russians and the Chinese have representatives at each others’ command headquarters and that recently they carried out in Moscow a joint command exercise involving joint operation of their respective anti-ballistic missile defences, something the US would never do at such a level with any of its allies.
Though we know little about some of these agreements, it is possible to make educated guesses about some of them. In terms of defence technology cooperation the Chinese for example are known to rely heavily on Russian liquid fuel technology for their rocket engines both for their ballistic missiles and for their space programme, which in general appears to rely heavily on Russian technology, even for design of space vehicles. As it happens, the information from the latest summit meeting in Beijing suggests that the Russians and the Chinese could even be taking their first steps towards merging their respective space programmes. The Chinese also seem to depend heavily on the Russians for their gas turbine technology including for their military aircraft engines. In fact there are rumours – always denied – that Chinese military aircraft projects draw heavily on Russian technical advice. The Russians for their part are said to rely on the Chinese increasingly for electronic subcomponents for some of their systems and there are persistent rumours – also always denied – that they have looked to the Chinese for help with development of their aerial drones.
In foreign policy coordination it seems fairly clear that there are agreements for Russia to take the lead in the Syrian conflict and for China to take the lead in any matter concerning North Korea, with the two countries however always supporting each other’s positions in each conflict.
It is a certainty – and Putin has recently confirmed as much – that the Russians and the Chinese also talk to each continuously about all other international questions and take care to coordinate their positions in respect of them. They have certainly done so for example in relation to such questions as the Ukrainian conflict (where China has quietly recognised Crimea as a part of Russia), the Iranian nuclear agreement, the conflict between China and the US in the South China Sea (where Russia backs China) and China’s claim for unification with Taiwan (ditto).
Importantly, we do not know the identities of the individuals in the Russian and Chinese governments who on a day to day basis conduct these contacts, though obviously the embassies of the two countries in each others’ capitals are heavily involved. However it is striking that the two countries’ foreign ministers – Sergey Lavrov and Wang Yi – do not appear to be involved. They scarcely ever meet with each other or visit each other’s countries, which suggests that the two countries’ leaderships have, quite intentionally, assigned them the task of dealing with relations with third countries and not with anything to do with the relationship Russia and China have forged with each other. Apparently this is dealt with at a different and more senior level.
The best guess is that in the Russian case the official who has day to day management of Russia’s relations with China is Sergey Ivanov, Putin’s powerful Chief of Staff and head of Russia’s Presidential Administration, who appears to have frequent meetings with Chinese officials.
(The last year has settled this question. It is now known that day to day management of the Chinese-Russian relationship is managed by President Putin’s Executive Office headed by his Chief of Staff Anton Vaino and by the General Office of the Communist Party of China, headed by President Xi’s Chief of Staff Li Zhanshu).
In all essentials this is an extremely close alliance between two Great Powers. It is sometimes said that because it is not underpinned by ideology but rests purely on self-interest that somehow makes it brittle. My own view on the contrary is that the fact that the alliance is based purely on self-interest and not on ideology or sentiment – so that the two allies have no illusions about each other – makes it deeper and stronger.
The alliance does however have one special feature which in the modern world makes it unique. Most countries when they forge alliances with other countries go out of their way to publicise the fact. By contrast the reason why the alliance between Russia and China is not widely recognised for what it is, is because of the extraordinary lengths to which both Great Powers go to deny the fact of its existence.
The reason for this is not difficult to see. Alliances tend to get defined by their enemies. The Russian-Chinese alliance is clearly pitted against the other great alliance system of the modern world: that of the US and its allies. Both the Russians and the Chinese however want to maintain at least for the moment the fiction that they and the US and its allies are not enemies or even adversaries but are “partners”. Though with the crises in Ukraine and the South Sea China Sea this fiction is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain, it remains important to both the Russians and the Chinese to preserve it so that they can maintain a political dialogue not just with the US but also with the US’s allies, especially Germany and Japan, as well as a place in the international institutions such as the World Bank and the IMF which have been historically dominated by the US.
It is precisely for this reason that neocon hardliners in the US like Senator McCain, who want to preserve the US’s geostrategic dominance, want on the contrary to tear down all pretences and to define Russia and China openly and clearly as the US’s enemies. That way they hope to reimpose tighter block discipline within the Western alliance and end any prospect of US allies becoming involved in Russian and Chinese projects like China’s Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank or the Russian/Chinese “Greater Eurasia” and Silk Road projects. They also hope that way to minimise or even exclude Russian and Chinese influence from US dominated international institutions like the IMF and the World Bank. Of course defining China as a US enemy also plays into the hands of protectionists in the US like Donald Trump, who would like to use that as an excuse to close the US market to Chinese goods.
Beyond the very complex relations Russia and China have with the West – which for the moment it is in their interest to keep complex – the Russians and the Chinese also have to consider the effect the public acknowledgement of their alliance would have on third powers such as India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Iran, which have had a history of conflicts with either Russia or China. By concealing the fact of their alliance the Russians and the Chinese can each preserve their historic relations with old friends – in Russia’s case with India, South Korea and Vietnam, in China’s case with Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Iran – which might otherwise become alarmed at the public announcement that a country they had always assumed was a friend had now formally become an ally of a former foe with whom they might still have a prickly relationship.
Last but not least, concealing the fact of their alliance for the Russians and the Chinese comes with the added dividend that influential US analysts and commentators such as former US ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul can remain in denial about it. A Russian-Chinese alliance being for such people a possibility too horrible to contemplate, the fact the Russians and the Chinese don’t announce it means that such people can continue to deny it even as evidence for it piles up around them. That suits the Russians and the Chinese perfectly, since it ensures that these people won’t try to mobilise US opinion against them.
The result is that though Russian and Chinese officials occasionally let slip that they see each other as allies – as Putin did the other day – in general they try to conceal the fact, pretending that their countries are not formal allies at all even though that is in fact precisely what they are. Thus in place of “alliance” they prefer to use the euphemism of “strategic partnership” or increasingly “grand strategic partnership” to describe their relationship.
(On the eve of President Xi’s meeting with President Putin in Moscow the Chinese came up with yet another euphemism: “comprehensive strategic partnership”)
It is also partly to conceal the fact of their alliance that the Russians and the Chinese have weaved a complex web of organisations around their alliance of which the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the BRICS are just two. Such organisations enable the Russians and the Chinese to create institutions like the BRICS Bank or the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank as multilateral ventures which are not targeted at the West, as it would not be possible for them to do if they were openly allied to each other.
These organisations also enable the Russians and the Chinese to engage countries like Brazil, India, Iran and Pakistan in a friendly way, treating them as equal partners, as they seek to extend the influence of their alliance into places like southern Africa and Latin America where it might not otherwise reach.
(This is as good a point as any to discuss the question of the BRICS. This is not an alliance and it is an error to treat it as one. It is a loose association of states set up on Russia’s initiative whose primary purpose is to conceal the existence of the Chinese-Russian alliance at its core. This is not to deny that useful work does not happen through the BRICS format. For example the BRICS is the vehicle for setting up the BRICS Bank, one of the new financial institutions China is setting up to rival the US dominated IMF and World Bank. It also provides the Chinese and the Russians with a means of institutional outreach to other important countries like India, Brazil and South Africa, and to achieve through them a political presence in Latin America, Africa and south west Asia. However the BRICS is not the primary institutional vehicle of the Chinese Russian alliance and membership of the BRICS does not make a country a member of that alliance. That is why elections or changes of government in places like India or Brazil have little bearing on the Chinese Russian alliance, or indeed on the BRICS itself.
The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation because its focus is on security rather than political cooperation is a rather more important and substantive organisation than the BRICS with a much more sophisticated and highly developed institutional infrastructure. However it too is ultimately a loose arrangement of states rather than a fully fledged alliance, and the functioning of the Chinese Russian alliance at its core does not depend on it)
It is a common trope that the world today is moving from a unipolar world dominated by one superpower – the US – towards a multipolar world, where there will be a more complex interchange between rival centres of power.
Whilst with the rise of India I think that is basically true, I do not think the terms unipolar or multipolar properly describe the world as it is now. Rather I think the world today is basically bipolar, just as it was during the Cold War, with two great international alliances facing off against each other just as they did then. Whereas during the Cold War it was the US and the Western alliance which faced off against the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies, today it is the US and the Western alliance versus the Eurasian alliance that has crystallised around Russia and China, which also includes certain Central Asian states that were formerly part of the USSR and which may shortly also include Iran.
That the duel between these two great alliances, unlike the Cold War, is being conducted mainly in the shadows and without the ideological dimension that marked the Cold War does not mean it is any less real. On the contrary it is not only real but is taking place all the time and as it is happening it is reshaping our world.",The Duran,1

The Latest on the deaths of 10 people whose bodies were found in a broiling tractor-trailer in a Walmart parking lot in San Antonio (all times local):
Guatemalan diplomat Cristy Andrino says that among the 10 people who died after being found in the back of a tractor-trailer outside a Texas Walmart was a 19-year-old Guatemalan who had been deported and was on his way back to Maryland to rejoin his family.
Andrino says Frank Guisseppe Fuentes' fingerprints were in the system because he'd previously been deported. The diplomat says ""that's how they knew who the body belonged to so fast.""
Andrino says Fuentes was born in Guatemala but immigrated to the United States as a child. His parents are in the U.S. illegally, and hadn't yet given her instructions on what to do with the body. She says they may fear ICE agents could come after them if they claim the body.
Houston immigration lawyer Jacob Monty says deportation would have barred Fuentes from re-entering the country legally. He says his case reflected ""the kind of desperate, no-hope person that's going to get into the back of a semi-truck.""
A congressman says a truck that carried dozens of immigrants, 10 of whom died, passed through a Border Patrol checkpoint around two hours before it was discovered in the parking lot of a San Antonio Walmart.
U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he had been informed by law enforcement that the truck driven by James Matthew Bradley Jr. cleared the Interstate 35 checkpoint north of Laredo around 10 p.m. Saturday. Police arrived at the Walmart parking lot at 12:23 a.m. Sunday.
Cuellar said he didn't know whether immigrants crossing into the United States illegally were loaded into the truck before or after it crossed the checkpoint.
The station is 29 miles north of the border, along the interstate that links Laredo and San Antonio and is a primary north-south route in the United States. The station is equipped with license plate readers and dogs that sniff vehicles heading north.
A Customs and Border Protection spokesman did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.
An official with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says investigators examining the deaths of 10 people found inside a broiling, packed tractor-trailer in San Antonio consider the driver to be just one member of a large ""organization"" behind the human smuggling operation.
Shane Folden, special agent in charge of ICE's Homeland Security Investigations office in San Antonio, told The Associated Press Tuesday that agents want to ""dismantle the complete organization."" The immigrants were found Sunday inside a tractor-trailer at a Walmart in San Antonio.
Folden says that could include money transfers, stash houses for immigrants smuggled across the U.S.-Mexico border, and other people involved in planning the operation.
Trucker James Matthew Bradley Jr. faces a federal human smuggling charge that could carry the death penalty. Folden declined to say whether Bradley was cooperating with authorities.
Agents have interviewed just five of the dozens of people on board the trailer. Twenty-two people are still hospitalized.
Federal regulators say they are investigating the troubled Iowa trucking company linked to the 10 deaths of immigrants found in one of its trailers in Texas.
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration confirmed Tuesday that it is investigating Pyle Transportation.
The agency says its findings will be shared with Department of Homeland Security investigators, who are conducting a criminal investigation into the immigrants' deaths.
Company owner Brian Pyle said Monday that he had no idea how dozens of immigrants became packed into a trailer with its name on it. He says the company had sold the trailer to an individual in Mexico, and an independent contractor was driving it to Brownsville, Texas, to carry out the sale.
The Schaller, Iowa-based company has a history of safety and financial problems.
A Guatemalan diplomat says one survivor of the immigrant smuggling operation that claimed 10 lives told her Houston was the group's final destination.
That's three hours from where the tractor-trailer stopped in a San Antonio Walmart parking lot.
The diplomat said the teen hoped ultimately to reach New York. Another hospitalized Guatemalan, a 23-year-old, was bound for California.
Cristy Andrino, Guatemala's consul in McAllen, visited the 17-year-old Maya in the hospital. Andrino says the teen was in good spirits Tuesday and looking forward to reuniting with family.
She said he was happy to learn he wouldn't be deported because of his age. He spoke by phone with his mother and was showered with gifts from well-wishers.
She says he other hospitalized Guatemalan is a material witness in the criminal case against the truck driver and may be able to apply for a special visa available to victims who cooperate with prosecutors.
The state of Florida had suspended commercial driving privileges for a truck driver three months before he was arrested for driving a tractor-trailer so hot and so crammed with immigrants that 10 people died.
Alexis Bakofsky, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, confirmed Tuesday that the agency disqualified 60-year-old James Matthew Bradley Jr.'s commercial driving privileges in April when he failed to file an updated medical card. Federal law requires commercial drivers supply the card to show they are physically fit for the road.
Bradley's driving record shows he was issued a commercial driver's license in Florida in 2004. Bakofsky confirmed the Florida license was disqualified indefinitely. Bakofsky also says it would have been illegal for him to have held a second license from another state.
Bradley faces charges of illegally transporting immigrants for financial gain resulting in death. The immigrants were found inside his truck at a Walmart in San Antonio.
Court records show that a long-haul truck driver charged in the deaths of 10 immigrants found inside his sweltering tractor-trailer in San Antonio had been cited repeatedly for violating federal motor carrier safety regulations in Iowa dating back to 1995.
At least two of the tickets were for logging more hours than allowed.
James Matthew Bradley Jr.'s most recent infraction came in April 2013. He was ticketed for violating a rule that bars truckers from driving longer than 14 hours without a break. The citation shows that he was driving for Pyle Transportation. He was fined $127.50.
The records show Bradley also received tickets for violations of federal safety rules following stops or inspections in 2011, 2010 and 1995. They included a ""maximum hours of service violation"" for driving too much without rest in 2010.
A long-haul truck driver charged in the deaths of 10 immigrants found inside his sweltering tractor-trailer called his fiancee Sunday from a jail more than 1,000 miles from home and briefly described the gruesome events.
Darnisha Rose says James Matthew Bradley Jr., who she called a generous person, claimed he had no idea how so many people came to be crammed inside his trailer in the Texas heat.
The 60-year-old Bradley, a diabetic whose criminal history includes a conviction in a felony domestic violence case, told Rose that he'd stopped his truck at a San Antonio Walmart and went inside to use the bathroom. He claimed that when he returned to his truck, he noticed the trailer rocking back and forth.
He said he'd heard nothing before that.
Mexico's foreign ministry says 25 of the migrants found inside a sweltering tractor-trailer found parked outside a Texas Walmart were Mexican.
In a statement Monday night, the ministry says that based on interviews by Mexican consulate personnel and contact with local authorities, ""we can say that of the 10 people who lost their lives ... four were of Mexican nationality.""
The statement also says that of the 29 people hospitalized, 21 are Mexican.
Also Monday, the man charged with driving the rig appeared in federal court in San Antonio.
James Matthew Bradley Jr. faces charges of illegally transporting immigrants for financial gain, resulting in death. The judge explained to Bradley that he could face the death penalty, if convicted.
In the federal complaint, Bradley told authorities he didn't realize anyone was inside the 18-wheeler.

Chinese Court Orders Offenders To Use Humiliating New Ringtone,"Posted by Asia Mayfield | Jul 28, 2017 | Liberal Corruption
A Chinese court is utilizing an odd method to get debtors to pay up- shame. People who owe too much money will be forced to change their ringtone and all of their callers will be greeted with a description of the debt.
You might be willing to pay your debts if you faced enough social pressure. At least, that’s what a court in China believes. The Guanyun’s People Court has come up with a unique way to deal with unrepentant debtors.
People who default on their debt and refuse opportunities to repair the situation can now be subjected to a new rule. Their cell phone ring tone will change into something embarrassing and all of their callers will be greeted with the following message:
“The user of the number you’ve dialed has been listed as someone who is avoiding debt repayments ordered by the Guanyun County People’s Court. Please urge this person to fulfill their legal obligations. The Guanyun People’s Court thanks you for your support.”
Changing your phone number is pointless. Chinese law requires people to use their real names to register new phones.
“Wang Yong with the Guanyun County People’s Court says the new campaign is specifically focused, and has so far only targeted people the Court knows have the means to repay their debts. The majority of the ten people on the new ‘shame campaign’ are local business owners,” China Daily reports.
“Authorities in China have already been given a variety of options this year to try to deal with ‘deadbeat debtors,’ including bans on the purchase of airline tickets, restrictions on train travel services and driving privileges, on top of restrictions to additional loans.”
Debtors prisons were common until people realized that they were pointless. Keeping a debtor in prison deprives him or her of the chance of earning enough money to repay the debt.
The method is certainly unconventional, but it might prove effective. Society is a strong bond. Many people would pay money to be spared embarrassment. However, so far only ten people have received the new sentence. It’s unclear whether any of the ten have begun repaying their debts.
Chinese culture has evolved rapidly in the last few decades. Within living memory, most of China’s population suffered from starvation and malnutrition. Now the country is one the world’s biggest super powers.
“Yet large sections of Asian and Western opinion already concede to China the role of a predominant power, assuming that it may be best to acquiesce to inevitability. The Chinese are delighted to be benchmarked to the United States with the corollary… that the latter must accommodate China to avoid inevitable conflict between established and rising power,” writes Shyam Saran.
Chinese culture is not American culture and vice versa. Shaming debtors into settling their accounts probably wouldn’t work in the U.S., but it could in China. A man or woman saddled with such an embarrassing ring tone might have trouble getting a job, or a date. Everyone in their life will find out that they owe money.
China’s sprawling culture is becoming more advanced every year. The country has risen remarkably in the last few decades, transforming from an impoverished, starving land to a global super power.
Xin Lu, a finance blogger who grew up in China states:
“Your salary is not a secret– If you ask a Chinese person in China how much money he or she makes, odds are that person will tell you. Discussing one’s income is not always a matter of bragging because not everyone is rich. Most of the time I see Chinese people do this as a way of getting to know another person. Once you speak to people and find out their income they tell you more about how they live. It is not a rude or bad thing in my culture to talk about money, and sometimes good comes out of it. For example, my dad helped his friend secure a 20% raise after he found out that man’s salary.”
People who are comfortable discussing their income likely won’t shy away from discussing debts. Frugality is treasured in Chinese culture. A man or woman who ignores that, and then is forced to feel the sting of society’s disapproval, might learn to change their habits.",Conservative Daily Post,1
Watch VIDEO of cops pulling over Florida State Attorney,"Jul. 13, 2017 11:14 am by   • No Comments
A few weeks ago Orlando police pulled over a car which turned out to be the car of Aramis Ayala, Florida’s first and only black elected state attorney.
Here’s how it went:
Florida state attorney pulled over in traffic stop hopes to use the incident as a teachable moment for police https://t.co/GdJZo478de pic.twitter.com/y4K6rR0LQC
— CNN (@CNN) July 13, 2017
I was impressed at how professional and cordial the officers were and their reasons for stopping the car were absolutely legitimate.
Ayala agrees the stop was lawful, but says this:
CNN – Ayala confirmed that she was pulled over on June 19 in Parramore after leaving Florida A&M University College of Law, where she had taught class that evening. While she agreed with police that the stop was lawful, she left no question that she intends to follow it up.
“To be clear, I violated no laws. The license plate, while confidential was and remains properly registered. The tint was in no way a violation of Florida law,” she said.
“Although the traffic stop appears to be consistent with Florida law (my) goal is to have a constructive and mutually respectful relationship between law enforcement and the community,” she said.
I look forward to sitting down to have an open dialogue with the Chief of Orlando Police Department regarding how this incident impacts that goal.”
Why is there a need for a follow up on this? Why is there a need for an ‘open dialogue’? The officers were just doing their job and I would expect if they ran across another car they didn’t recognize that had a plate that didn’t come back as registered, they might stop that car as well. And I’d be totally fine with it.
It sounds like Ayala might be trying to make something out of nothing here. She agrees that the stop was lawful, so what more is there to say?
As a side note, did you see the Ford truck the cops were driving? I’ve seen cops driving suburbans and such, but never a Ford F-150 like that. I’ll definitely be keeping an eye out for that now where I live.",The Right Scoop,1

Senate Republicans launched their plan for shriveling Barack Obama's health care law Thursday, edging a step closer to their dream of repeal with a bill that would slice and reshape Medicaid for the poor, relax rules on insurers and end tax increases on higher earners that have helped finance expanded coverage for millions.
Four conservative GOP senators quickly announced initial opposition to the measure and others were evasive, raising the specter of a jarring rejection by the Republican-controlled body. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., indicated he was open to discussion and seemed determined to muscle the measure through his chamber next week.
Release of the 142-page proposal ended the long wait for one of the most closely guarded bills in years. McConnell stitched it together behind closed doors, potentially moving President Donald Trump and the GOP a step closer to achieving perhaps their greatest goal — repealing former President Obama's 2010 statute, his proudest domestic legacy.
At the White House, Trump spoke of a bill ""with heart."" On Facebook, Obama said at the heart of the bill was ""fundamental meanness.""
The bill would end Obama's tax penalties on people who don't buy insurance — effectively ending the so-called individual mandate — and on larger companies that don't offer coverage to their workers. It would provide less generous subsidies for people than Obama's law but provide billions to states and insurance companies to buttress markets that in some areas have been abandoned by insurers.
McConnell must navigate a narrow route in which defections by just three of the 52 Republican senators would doom the legislation. He and others said the measure would make health insurance more affordable and eliminate Obama coverage requirements that some people find onerous.
""We have to act,"" McConnell said. ""Because Obamacare is a direct attack on the middle class, and American families deserve better than its failing status quo.""
Democrats said the measure would result in skimpier policies and higher out-of-pocket costs for many and erode gains made under Obama that saw roughly 20 million additional Americans gain coverage.
""We live in the wealthiest country on earth. Surely we can do better than what the Republican health care bill promises,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.
Four conservative senators expressed opposition but openness to talks: Ted Cruz of Texas, Kentucky's Rand Paul, Mike Lee of Utah and Ron Johnson from Wisconsin. They said the measure falls short, missing ""the most important promise that we made to Americans: to repeal Obamacare and lower their health care costs.""
On the other hand, Sens. Dean Heller of Nevada, facing a competitive 2018 re-election battle, and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia expressed concerns about the bill's Medicaid cuts. And Susan Collins of Maine reiterated her opposition to language blocking federal money for Planned Parenthood, which many Republicans oppose because it provides abortions.
At the White House, Trump called Democrats ""obstructionists"" for opposing the measure and added, ""We'll hopefully get something done and it will be something with heart and very meaningful.""
Obama was more than skeptical.
""If there's a chance you might get sick, get old or start a family, this bill will do you harm,"" he wrote. He said ""small tweaks"" during the upcoming debate ""cannot change the fundamental meanness at the core of this legislation.""
The House approved its version of the bill last month. Though Trump lauded its passage in a Rose Garden ceremony, he called the House measure ""mean"" last week.

The Latest: Senate GOP health bill seeks to hobble Obama law
History Lesson: How the Democrats pushed Obamacare through the Senate
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said under the House bill, 23 million fewer people would have coverage by 2026. The budget office analysis of the Senate measure is expected early next week.
The Senate legislation drew support from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which said it would ""stabilize crumbling insurance markets"" and curb premium increases. But medical groups announced opposition, saying it would diminish coverage. They include the American Academy of Pediatrics and America's Essential Hospitals, whose members treat many poor patients.
The Senate bill would phase out extra money Obama's law provides to 31 states that agreed to expand coverage under the federal-state Medicaid program. Those additional funds would continue through 2020, then gradually fall and disappear entirely in 2024.
Ending Obama's expansion has caused major rifts among GOP senators. Some from states that have expanded have battled to further delay the phase-out, while conservative Republicans have sought to halt the funds quickly.
Beginning in 2020, the Senate measure would also limit the federal funds states get each year for Medicaid. The program currently gives states all the money needed to cover eligible recipients and procedures.
The Senate bill largely uses people's incomes as the yardstick for helping those without workplace coverage to buy private insurance. That would focus the aid more on people with lower incomes than the House legislation, which bases its subsidies on age.
Caroline Pearson, a senior vice president of the consulting firm Avalare Health, said the Senate subsidies would be smaller than Obama's because they're keyed to the cost of a bare-bones plan and because additional help now provided for deductibles and copayments would eventually be discontinued.
The bill would let states get waivers to ignore some coverage requirements under Obama's law, such as specific health services insurers must now cover.
States could not get exemptions to Obama's prohibition against charging higher premiums for some people with pre-existing medical conditions, but the subsidies would be lower, making coverage less affordable, Pearson said. States would also have to retain Obama's requirement that family insurance cover children up to age 26.
The bill would also bar using tax credits to buy coverage that includes abortions. That language could be forced out of the bill for procedural reasons, which would threaten support from conservatives, but Republicans would seek other ways to retain the restriction.
For the next two years, the Senate would also provide money that insurers use to help lower out-of-pocket costs for millions of lower income people. Trump has been threatening to discontinue those payments, and some insurance companies have cited uncertainty as a reason they are abandoning some markets and boosting premiums.

Who was Marshall McLuhan and how did he predict the internet?,"Who was Marshall McLuhan?
20 July 2017 • 4:37pm
Herbert Marshall McLuhan is famed for having one of the most poignant predictions of the 20th century. The philosopher and intellectual foresaw the birth of the internet 35 years before it happened.
On the day that would have been McLuhan's 106th birthday he is being honoured with a Google Doodle.
Who was Marshall McLuhan?
Born in Canada in 1911, McLuhan studied at the University of Manitoba and University of Cambridge before becoming a lecturer at the University of Toronto. He rose to prominence in the 1960s for his work as a media theorist and for coining the term ""global village"", which was a prescient vision of the internet age.
His theories were met with controversy in academic circles throughout the 1970s and after his death in 1980. Then in 1989, the internet was born, and McLuhan was looked upon with renewed interest.
How did McLuhan predict the internet age?
McLuhan's preeminent theory was his idea that human history could be divided into four eras: the acoustic age, the literary age, the print age and the electronic age. He outlined the concept in a 1962 book called The Gutenberg Galaxy, which was released just as the television was starting to become popular.
He predicted the world was entering the fourth, electronic age, which would be characterised by a community of people brought together by technology.
He called it the ""global village"" and said it would be an age when everyone had access to the same information through technology. The ""global village"" could be understood to be the internet.
In his follow-up book, Understanding Media, he expanded the theory to show the method of communication rather than the information itself would come to be the most influential fact of the electronic age.
He soon became a TV personality, making regular appearances to explain his theory of why ""the medium is the message"".
He became the most publicised English teacher of the 20th century, a prestige that only grew with the realisation of his vision of the ""computer as a research and communication instrument"".
In the 21st century people have a world of information at their finger tips on smartphones, tablets and laptops. The internet has facilitated a breaking down of global barriers and the democratisation of knowledge.
McLuhan's predictions caused a frenzy in the US, with high profile magazines and authors rallying around him. He was the subject of a Tom Wolfe article titled ""What if he is right?"" that was published in New York Magazine.
His theory influenced the likes of French philosopher Jean Baudrillard, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister's father, and artist Andy Warhol.

Three killed in Honolulu high-rise fire,"July 15 (UPI) -- Three people died in a fire that started on the 26th floor of a 36-story apartment building in Honolulu, officials said.
The high-rise blaze began at 2:15 p.m. Friday in the 538-unit Marco Polo Apartments on Kapiolani Boulevard, the Honolulu Fire Department said. The fire spread to the 27th and 28th floors, KHON reported..
Two women and a man were found dead in two apartments, Honolulu Fire Department spokesman Capt. David Jenkins said. Investigators are looking into the fire's cause.
Emergency Medical Services treated 10 people at the scene, and took five people, including a firefighter treated for fire exhaustion, to the hospital. The firefighter was treated and released.
About 100 firefighters extinguished the fire and evacuated residents. The fire was brought under control at 7 p.m., Mayor Kirk Caldwell said on Twitter.
Marco Polo, which was built in 1971, does not have a sprinkler system.
""Without a doubt, if there was sprinklers in this apartment, the fire would be contained to the unit of origin,"" Honolulu Fire Chief Manuel Neves said.
Resident Joel Horiguchi told CNN the blaze leaped up two floors.
""I looked out my window, and noticed black smoke,"" Horiguchi said. ""I then opened my window to find the fire was a unit above us, just across. I also heard a neighbor above screaming for help.""
Firefighters staged their equipment on the 24th floor.
""Any high-rise fire would be very difficult, and it's very difficult when you consider getting water to the fire, also with the amount of people in the building as well,"" Jenkins said.

Trump: Democrats Now GUARANTEED to Lose in 2018,"by Julie Driscoll | Jul 27, 2017
 
All the brouhaha over President Trump’s transgender ban from the military.
And like most Leftist belly-aching, it’s much ado about nothing. Let’s look at the actual stats.
According to ABC News, the number of people who may be transgender in the military lies somewhere between 1,320 to 6,630 out of 1.3 million active duty service members. If my math is right, that’s about 0.0005 percent. Whether President Trump’s move to ban transgenders from military service is wrong or right is up for debate. Perhaps, fitness for duty should be the only barometer. But any way you crack it, the numbers of people affected are minuscule.
Right now, there are 250 military persons “transforming” from one sex to another. That’s 0.00001 percent of the military. So what the LGBTQ community wants is millions of dollars spent, and policies enacted for at most 0.00005 percent of the people?
It gets seriously old watching left-wing heads explode whenever someone isn’t comfortable. News flash: There’s no constitutional guarantee to be perfectly comfortable all the time. There’s no constitutional guarantee that everything will be fair and just all the time. Maybe transgender people should be able to serve. But you know what else could bar you from the military? Bad teeth, headaches, endometriosis and ADHD. If you have those – and hundreds of other – conditions, it’s not your fault. But the government still might not let you serve.
There are myriad jobs that many of us can’t have, for many reasons.
Yes, this is a government job, and yes, discrimination is wrong. But is this really discrimination?
Let’s be real, here – unattractive females aren’t gonna be hired as Hooters gals. Nor will pretty girls with no “hooters”. Generally, slightly built males won’t be bouncers. Simply put, certain jobs have specific requirements and you may or may not match them, for a variety of reasons.
Really, it’s getting so damn old. If a liberal’s feelings are hurt or they’re denied anything, they devolve into crazed, demented hysteria. Anyone who lives on this planet knows that a lot of time, life isn’t fair. We don’t always get a job we want. Nor do we get a lover we want. We usually don’t make the money we want. So what? As the saying goes, “Most men live lives of quiet desperation.”
We don’t know the ins and outs of the decision-making around this transgender ban. And most of us don’t profess to be military experts. But what we do know is that Bill Clinton gave us DADT. Hillary Clinton didn’t come out in favor of gay marriage until 2013. Barack Obama evolved into support for gay marriage during his presidency. And liberals are, as usual, jumping the shark.
President Trump banning transgender individuals in the military doesn’t mean he hates gays. He just sees the idiocy of creating military policy for a handful of service members.
And despite the rancor the LGBTQ community and other Democrats are making, this move only proves that President Trump is the best man for the job.
This won’t stop Democrats from trying to make hay from the news. However, they should be worrying about the 2018 midterms instead of a few thousand slighted transsexuals.
As reported by The Week,
. . . Democrats have a significant challenge in front of them. In the House, they must capture 24 seats held by Republicans as well as hold the 12 districts won by Trump but occupied by Democrats. In the Senate, Democrats have to basically run the table . . .
Democrats have no message, but they sure corner the market on self-pity. Their slogan, “Better Deal,” is just sad, and in fact is not even a message at all.
Yet again, they’ve learned nothing, as they spend their time on identity politics, portraying transsexual military personnel as “downtrodden.” Who next, people with flat feet who aren’t allowed to serve. What about asthmatics? Who will fight for their rights?
Far be it from a Demexiter like me to help Democrats get on track. But their message should be about considering everybody a victim. It’s time the Democrats grow up and allow others to do the same.

If you’ve been living under a rock for the past few days, you’re probably unaware that Donald Trump Jr. committed treason. After lying about it and realizing that wouldn’t work, he tweeted out evidence of his guilt — something that for some reason doesn’t have the Right up in arms like it would if anyone else did it.
Subscribe to our Youtube Channel
Trump Jr. received an email from a friend of his father’s who helped the Trump family with the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013. Trump Jr. was told that a Kremlin-connected lawyer was offering him damaging information about Hillary Clinton on behalf of the Russian government.
According to Donald Trump, this is perfectly normal. You or I, he says, would have made the decision to knowingly collude with a hostile foreign government for personal gain.
“I think from a practical standpoint, most people would have taken that meeting. It’s called opposition research or even research into your opponent,” Trump told reporters at a press conference in Moscow Thursday.
The New York Times reports that this is not standard, and that the only parallel in U.S. history involves Richard Nixon:
There is only one known historical parallel to the Trump campaign’s contacts with the Russians, and it involves Richard M. Nixon. Running for president in 1968, Nixon told H. R. Haldeman, his eventual White House chief of staff, to “monkey wrench” peace talks in Vietnam in order to scuttle any deal that would have handed Hubert Humphrey, the Democratic nominee, a political victory in the closing days of the election.
Nixon, a former senator and vice president, had a relationship with the South Vietnamese government. Earlier in the year, he had met with the country’s ambassador and brought along Anna Chennault, a prominent Chinese-American Republican. As the author John A. Farrell writes in his new book, “Richard Nixon: The Life,” which reports the “monkey wrench” instructions, the call between Nixon and Haldeman took place on Oct. 22, 1968, and Haldeman dutifully jotted down what he was told.
A group of aides to Ronald Reagan did meet in the fall of 1980 with an individual claiming to be an emissary from the Iranian government, but that person’s legitimacy was never determined.
The Trump family says that the meeting was not important because no usable information came from it (though Trump himself tweeted about Hillary Clinton’s emails for the first time about 20 minutes after the meeting ended) — like if you rushed into a store with a gun to rob it and had to retreat after slipping on the freshly mopped floor. To Trump, your intentions nor the gun matter — only that it didn’t benefit you.
This sort of thing doesn’t happen with respectable politicians. When a Russian ambassador reached out to John F. Kennedy and his democratic primary opponent Adlai Stevenson in 1960, both candidates rebuked him.
This is not normal. This is not acceptable. Trump must be impeached before the damage he does is irreversible.

"DEMS DYING: Maxine Waters Raises PATHETIC $22,000 in Campaign Contributions","by Kevin Jackson | Jul 19, 2017
 
Maxine Waters is a high profile Negro for the Democrats.
In fact, Waters is the highest profile Negro of the Congressional Negro Circus. And she’s been a good slave soldier, doing the dirty work for white Democrats for decades.
Her most recent protestations involve impeaching Donald Trump. She has no reason to protest President Trump, however that’s what she’s trained to do. And up to this point she’s been pretty well paid.
Recall Waters was cleared of giving her husband’s bank a few million dollars. But maybe the Left no longer see Waters as viable.
After all, blacks didn’t show up to support Hillary Clinton, so why should the plantation owners continue to treat Waters as a “house” Negro?
According to the Washington Free Beacon, maybe the Democrats are sending Waters a warning shot.
Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters (Calif.), who has been considered a leader of the movement within Congress to “resist” Donald Trump, has received a little more than $20,000 in individual contributions to her campaign so far this year despite her elevated profile.
Waters is also $100,000 in debt to her daughter, who runs a lucrative endorsement mailer operation for the campaign, filings show.
Citizens for Waters, Rep. Waters’ campaign committee, reported receiving just $12,600 individual contributions throughout the second quarter, which runs between April 1 and June 30. During the first quarter, which spans from Jan. 1 to March 31, the campaign reported $9,508.79 in individual contributions. Waters has now pulled in just $22,108.79 in total individual contributions.
The campaign has compensated for the low amount of individual contributions by pulling in six figures from political action committees. The campaign reported $2,500 from PACs during the first quarter and $99,500 during the second quarter.
Rep. Waters’ campaign now has $193,714.02 cash on hand and debts totaling $128,748.12. A majority of the debt is owed to Karen Waters, the daughter of Maxine Waters.
At least Waters gets to keep part of her larcenous earnings in the family.
Waters’ daughter is in charge of the campaign’s “slate mailer,” or endorsement mailer, operation that has proved lucrative for the campaign by raising hundreds of thousands in donations from other candidates’ committees in exchange for placement on a mailer sent out to constituents in California.
And Karen Waters has earned her keep, as her mother extorted money from other campaigns. Karen Waters pulled in more than $650,000 from her mother’s campaign since first running the operation. At the end of the first quarter, the Waters campaign marked a $108,000 debt to Karen for her services. Of that debt, Waters has paid her daughter $8,500 of that debt in the past three months. However, she is still owed $99,000 from the campaign, according to the most recent filings.
Let’s just keep it real. These mailers are little more than campaign graft. Legalized extortion.
The Free Beacon article continues,
Throughout the 2016 election cycle, Waters pulled in more than $300,000 from the operation. Slate mailers, which are common in California, have come under heavy scrutiny in the past.
For the Left who claim they want campaign finance reform, I suggest they look into this criminal activity.

"Sessions says he'll continue as attorney general for ""as long as it's appropriate""","Sessions says he'll continue on as attorney general for ""as long as it's appropriate""
Last Updated Jul 20, 2017 11:34 AM EDT
Attorney General Jeff Sessions says he will continue to serve as the Attorney General for ""as long as it's appropriate"" -- after President Trump said in an interview that he regretted appointing Sessions, given his recusal from the ongoing Russia investigation.
""I have the honor of serving as Attorney General. It's something goes beyond any thought I would have ever had for myself,"" he said, in response to a reporter's question about Mr. Trump's remarks. We love this job. We love this department, and I plan to continue to do so as long as that is appropriate.""
Mr. Trump told the New York Times in an interview that he never would have picked Sessions to lead the Justice Department if he'd known Sessions would recuse himself in the investigation into Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election.
""Jeff Sessions takes the job, gets into the job, recuses himself, which frankly I think is very unfair to the president,"" the president said in the 50-minute interview. ""How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused himself before the job, I would have said, 'Thanks, Jeff, but I'm not going to take you.' It's extremely unfair -- and that's a mild word -- to the president.""
Sessions went on to say that he's ""totally confident"" that he, along with the rest of the agency can continue to run the department in an effective way.
""We're serving right now, the work were doing today is the kind of work we intend to continue.""
He added, ""We and this Department of Justice will continue every single day to work hard to serve the national interests, and we wholeheartedly join in priorities of President Trump.""
In the last few months, after Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation, he offered to resign, but Mr. Trump refused the offer, the Washington Post reported in June.
Sessions addressed the apparent tension with Mr. Trump at a Justice Department press conference announcing the takedown of one of the largest dark web markets in the world.

House Committee Votes to Form 6th Military Branch – The Space Corps,"After hours of deliberation Wednesday, the House Armed Services Committee decided to move forward with the creation of a sixth branch of the military. The Space Corps branch, which would fall under the control of the Air Force, would handle any military operations in orbit. As you might imagine, there are those who stoutly against this change.
Rep. Mike Turner initially purposed an amendment that would stop the creation of Space Corps. The Air Force also spoke out in opposition to the sixth military branch, which would be their responsibility, stating that it would become an unnecessary bureaucracy, per reports from The Hill.
Last week, Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson spoke on behalf of the Air Force when she commented that Space Corps would likely result in a branch that is “more complex, add more boxes to the organization chart and cost more money.”
Turner expressed his concerns after his amendment was denied. “This mark is asking us to do something we have not done since 1947,” Turner explained. “My concern is that we just have not risen to the level of the knowledge for us to make a decision….”
Those that support the bill such as Rep. Mike Rogers said: “The Air Force is like any other bureaucracy. They don’t want to change. They certainly don’t want Congress telling them they have to change. But this is our role. It is what we’re here for. It has been painfully apparent from the briefings we’ve gotten from our general officers that both Russia and China have nearly caught us in space capabilities,” according to Space News.
Members of the Armed Services Committee insisted that they have carefully considered the idea of a Space Corps and are not simply jumping in without any research. However, there were committee members who told the press that they were unaware of what Space Corp even was prior to Wednesday night, according to the Washington Examiner.
“I’m not on the subcommittee — I’m on three other subcommittees — and this is honestly the first time I’ve heard about a major reorganization to our Air Force,” Rep. Martha McSally, who is an Air Force veteran, said. “I would just think that something this significant if we’re at that point in our committee that we would have hearings or discussions at the full committee level.”
It’s evident that not everyone is gung-ho about the idea of a sixth military branch, but as technology evolves, it will only be a matter of time until space becomes a frontier that all nations fight to control. The US might as well take steps now to prepare for that inevitability.",The Tribunist,1
HUMBLE SERVANT: Trump Stops to Pick Up Marine’s Hat (VIDEO),"President Trump showed his humble side when a Marine’s cover (people think it’s called a hat – it’s not) flew off his head, leading Trump to go chasing it down.
The Daily Caller reported:
Trump arrived at Joint Base Andrews following the G20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany, where he had his first face-to-face meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin.
While heading toward the Marine One helicopter, Trump noticed that one Marine had lost his dress hat to the wind.
Trump picked up the hat just in front of the steps to the helicopter and placed it back on the Marine’s head while giving him a couple of affectionate pats on his arm.
The wind blew the hat off of the Marine’s head again, and Trump once again veered off course to pick it up, this time handing the hat to his Air Force escort.

At this point, it’s hard to tell what the Trump administration will say next to attempt to deflect from anything at all involving The Donald and Russia.
Subscribe to our Youtube Channel
On Friday, White House spokesmoron Kellyanne Conway showed up on CNN to say that Democrats are just as bad as Trump’s Russian allies who hacked and interfered with our election because they had the audacity to speak out against him.
“The president has said previously… that he would be concerned about anybody interfering with our democracy,” she said. “We saw a lot of people interfering with our democracy by saying he couldn’t win here at home.”
Trump may be concerned with that form of “interference” because fascists are typically “concerned” with criticism, but he has shown absolutely zero problems with Vladimir Putin’s propaganda and hacking efforts meant to install Trump in the Oval Office.
Allisyn Camerota asked Conway what Trump plans to do to stop Russia from further interfering in our election, but she — well, she had nothing.
“Alisyn, I realize we just like to say the word ‘Russia, Russia’ to mislead the voters,” Conway said. “And I know that CNN is aiding and abetting this nonsense as well, but you’ve asked me this question three times now…”
“And you’re not answering it, Kellyanne!” Camerota said.
The reason Conway refuses to answer is that Trump and his minions are totally OK with that kind of interference. But criticism from an opposing political party? They just can’t handle it.

Kellyanne Conway uses flashcards for Russia talking points on Fox News,"The growing scandal of Russian election meddling and any ties to the Trump campaign is complex, so Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, simplified the White House's talking points with flash cards in a Wednesday night hit with Fox News' Sean Hannity.
""I just want to review in case you run out of time,"" Conway said. ""This is how I see it so far. This is to help all the people at home. What's the conclusion? Collusion? No, we don't have that yet. I see illusion and delusion. So just so we're clear everyone, conclusion? Collusion? No. Illusion, delusion, yes. I just thought we'd have some fun with words.""

""I'm gonna buy you a white board,"" Hannity joked.
Conway's defense comes shortly after Mr. Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., released an email chain with a Russian-connected publicist in which Trump Jr. appears to welcome efforts from the Russian government to support his father's campaign with information damaging to Hillary Clinton.
The White House has defended the eldest Trump son amid the controversy, but not even a trip to Paris could not shield the president from the story. Mr. Trump was asked to explain his son's actions in a joint press conference Thursday with French President Emmanuel Macron.
""He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer. Not a government lawyer, but a Russian lawyer. It was a short meeting,"" Mr. Trump said.
""From a practical standpoint most people would have taken that meeting, it's called opposition research,"" the president added.
On Twitter, the president has taken an even, if not upbeat, upbeat tone on the developments involving his son, but he is privately raging, according to reports. An adviser to the White House told CBS the Trump Jr. situation is like a ""Category Five hurricane.""

Texas Truck Driver Charged in Deaths of 10 Immigrants After Suspected Smuggling,"* A tractor-trailer was found Sunday in a San Antonio Walmart parking lot containing 30-40 immigrants. Eight people were found dead at the scene and two others died after being transported to local hospitals.
* On 24 July, the driver of the truck, James Bradley Jr., was charged in San Antonio under federal law for his alleged role in the deaths of the 10 people.
* Under federal law, the penalty for smuggling that results in death is “imprisonment for any term of years” or death.
* According to the federal complaint filed against Bradley, on the night of 23 July, a Walmart employee called the San Antonio Police Department to report a suspicious vehicle in the parking lot.
* According to San Antonio Police Chief William McManus, an immigrant from the truck approached the Walmart employee and asked for water. The employee then called the police.
* A San Antonio police officer approached the truck, finding Bradley in the driver’s seat and “multiple people standing and laying at and around the rear of the trailer.”
* Bradley claimed that he stopped at the Walmart to urinate and was “surprised” when a group of “Spanish” people ran out of his truck. According to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Bradley “said he knew at least one of them was dead.”
* San Antonio Fire Chief Charles Hood said during a press conference: “The air conditioning was not working… We had eight patients that were deceased. We had another twenty patients that were either in extremely critical condition or very serious condition, and they’ve been transported to a number of hospitals.”
* Adan Lara Vega, one of the immigrants, told the Associated Press from his hospital bed that the people who smuggled him and six friends before they were put in Bradley’s truck in Laredo, Texas had promised that the truck would be air-conditioned.
* The Mexican Foreign Ministry said Monday that 25 of the immigrants in the truck were Mexican. Four of the ten immigrants who died were Mexican, and the remaining 21 Mexican immigrants were receiving treatment in hospitals.
“This is not an isolated incident. This happens quite frequently. Fortunately, we came across this one, and fortunately there are people who survived. But this happens all the time.
Tragedy came to our doorstep. Our city prays for the victims & families. Thank you to fire, police & EMS who provided care to the survivors.
— Mayor Ron Nirenberg (@Ron_Nirenberg) July 23, 2017
“This tragedy demonstrates the brutality of the network of which I often speak. These smugglers have no regard for human life and seek only profits. The Department of Homeland Security and its partners in the US, Mexico and Central America will continue to root out these smugglers, bring them to justice and dismantle their networks.”
“By any standard, the horrific crime uncovered last night ranks as a stark reminder of why human smuggling networks must be pursued, caught and punished.”

When 16 American service members died on Monday after their transport plane had a midair emergency and plummeted into the rugged, rural farmland of the Mississippi Delta, the military suffered one of its worst aviation accidents in recent years. On Thursday, the bodies were taken to another transport plane, this one bound for Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, where military officials planned to process and prepare the remains.
Fifteen Marines and one sailor died in the crash, and the military publicly identified the victims on Friday:
Stewart Air National Guard Base
Nine of the crash victims were members of a Marine Aerial Refueling and Transport Squadron based in Newburgh, N.Y.
Cpl. Daniel I. Baldassare | When the 20-year-old crewmaster of the transport plane was a child playing football in Colts Neck, N.J., he made clear that he wanted to be a Marine: Corporal Baldassare, a friend told a television station, would bring military gloves to practice. And on his Twitter account this month, he wrote about how he missed boot camp. Neighbors around his childhood home in New Jersey were stunned after the crash; one wept when she told another about what had happened.
Capt. Sean E. Elliott | His call sign was Puffin, and as a child he imagined himself behind the controls of C-130s. His father recalled to The San Diego Union-Tribune that Captain Elliott, 30, would carry a model of one of the enormous planes to bed when he was young. On Monday, he was one of the pilots of the plane that crashed, a KC-130T, one of many variants of the C-130.

Continue reading the main story
Maj. Caine M. Goyette | He was the highest-ranking Marine on the flight and had been in the military since 1994. He was an aircraft commander who served three overseas deployments, the most recent of which ended in 2014.
Gunnery Sgt. Mark A. Hopkins | A Marine from Chesapeake, Va., he was “one of the calmest, most easygoing, zen people in any walk of life,” said Russ Hardin, a former Marine sergeant who served as a navigator in the squadron. “He didn’t know how not to be a friend,” Mr. Hardin said, recalling that Sergeant Hopkins preferred fishing, hiking, snorkeling and scuba diving to the barhopping habits of other troops posted to Japan.
Gunnery Sgt. Brendan C. Johnson | Sergeant Johnson, 46, was approaching the end of his career and was planning retirement and a possible move to Montana, his wife’s home state. His father said that the sergeant had joined the Marines after studying fine arts in Vermont, and that his grandfather and father-in-law were military veterans.
Continue reading the main story
Sgt. Julian M. Kevianne | Sergeant Kevianne spoke of joining the military long before he became a flight engineer. He enlisted in 2009, and a cousin told The Detroit News that the sergeant, 31, could be reserved at first, but that he could ultimately become “a loud blast of fun.” He was married and lived in New Windsor, N.Y.
Sgt. Owen J. Lennon | In his life before the Marine Corps, Sergeant Lennon, 26, was a football and tennis player who imagined a career in criminal justice. But once he was in the military, his mother told a Pomona, N.Y., neighbor, Jeff Scheer, he picked up an interest in mechanics and intended to work in aviation mechanics after finishing his service.
Cpl. Collin J. Schaaff | He entered the Marine Corps nearly four years ago and was promoted to corporal in December 2015. Corporal Schaaff was an aircraft ordnance technician from Pierce, Wash.

Staff Sgt. Joshua Snowden | By the time Sergeant Snowden, 31, graduated from high school in 2004, he had already enlisted in the Marine Corps, according to The Dallas Morning News. His Facebook page made his Texas pride plain, and the sergeant, a flight engineer, was a fan of the Dallas Cowboys.
Six of the Marines and the sailor were from an elite Marine Raider battalion based at Camp Lejeune, N.C.
Staff Sgt. Robert H. Cox | In a Marine Corps career that began 10 years ago this month, the sergeant was deployed overseas four times, according to the military. He was a critical skills operator from Ventura, Calif.
Staff Sgt. William Kundrat | Sergeant Kundrat, a father of two who married in 2004, joined the Marine Corps after high school. An Eagle Scout and football and lacrosse player in Maryland, he completed a tour of duty in Iraq and later joined a unit of Marine Special Operations Command, his mother told The Frederick News-Post. He was 33.
Sgt. Chad E. Jenson | He was a critical skills operator who joined the Marine Corps from Los Angeles and made sergeant in 2014.
Sgt. Talon R. Leach | The military said that the sergeant, who was from Callaway, Mo., deployed abroad last year as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, the United States’ campaign against the Islamic State. He joined the military in 2010.
Continue reading the main story
Petty Officer Second Class Ryan Lohrey | The only sailor aboard Monday’s flight, the Navy corpsman enlisted after finishing high school in Middletown, Ind., and he later served in two combat theaters overseas. His father told The Herald Bulletin, an Indiana newspaper, that his son had intended to go into nursing after his military career. The petty officer, who married in early June and had two children, had been awarded the Purple Heart.
Sgt. Joseph J. Murray | A son of veterans, Sergeant Murray had long disavowed any interest in the military, but he surprised his family when, toward the end of high school, he announced his plans to join the Marines. He was a husband and a father of four children, none of them older than 5, and his Christian faith was central to his life. His father said that Sergeant Murray, of the Jacksonville, Fla., area, was known for humming praise and worship songs while on patrol — and that when he would go quiet, “they took the safeties off their weapons because they all immediately thought something was up.”
Sgt. Dietrich A. Schmieman | He signed up for the Marines at 19 with an ambition to serve in special operations, his father said, and he served in a reconnaissance unit before joining the elite Raider command about two years ago. He was 26 and raised in Washington State before a military career that included two overseas deployments.

Texas man arrives at jury duty drunk with beer can in hand — then pours beer over deputies,"14 Jul 2017 at 12:01 ET
Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story!
A Tyler, Texas man arrived at the courthouse ready for jury duty this week intoxicated and with a beer poured into a Coca-Cola cup. If the man was attempting to avoid jury duty, it didn’t end well.
The Tyler Morning Telegraph reported the 23-year-old was quickly arrested. Deputies say that the court staff reported he was sluggishly walking around and slurring his speech.
The man reportedly left the jury room and then the building, appearing unstable. He then attempted to re-enter the courthouse when deputies stopped him. He then turned the Coca-Cola cup over to the deputies.
After a strong smell of alcohol wafted from the man, deputies asked him what was in the cup, the affidavit shows. He confirmed it was alcohol. He was then arrested for public intoxication and booked in the County Jail and held on a $260 bond.
The man had been arrested earlier in the year for public intoxication and driving under the influence.

"[VIDEO] Trump singles out BEAUTIFUL Irish reporter, says she has a nice smile; Reporter calls incident BIZARRE","Jun. 28, 2017 4:14 pm by   • No Comments
Yesterday Trump singled out a female reporter in the Oval Office during a phone call to the newly elected Prime Minister of Ireland. He referred to her indirectly as ‘beautiful’ and then called her over, asking who she was.
He then told the Irish PM that she has a “nice smile” and that he probably treats him well.

— Caitriona Perry (@CaitrionaPerry) June 27, 2017
The reporter, Caitriona Perry, called the incident Bizarre:
TELEGRAPH – Caitriona Perry, White House correspondent for RTE, Ireland’s public service broadcaster, described Tuesday’s incident as “bizarre”.
“One minute we were outside the window and the next minute I’m meeting the President of the United States,” she said.
“Usually we would shoot from outside the window of the White House and that’s what we were expecting today.
“But instead we were invited inside to witness the president’s call to the Taoiseach.
“When we went in he was already on the phone but I caught his eye and he called me over.”
I’m not sure if she took offense to it or not, but clearly some did as the Telegraph points out, calling it at best inappropriate.
But they also point out that others thought it was just a moment of levity.
For me, the fact that he called the press ‘beautiful’ and then called her over suggests that he thought she was good looking and therefore makes it inappropriate and weird.
I didn’t find it ‘creepy’ though, as some have suggested. But it was a bit weird. If he hadn’t said ‘beautiful’ at the beginning, I think it would have been much more appropriate.
Also his comment about her having a nice smile was pretty innocent.",The Right Scoop,1

TIME Magazine Just Sent A BRILLIANT F**k You To Trump With Its New Cover (IMAGE),"July 20, 2017 News, Politics
?>&url;=?>ℑ=?>?w=640"" target=""_blank"" class=""socicon-twitter twurl"">
Donald Trump’s disastrous first week in office just got a WHOLE lot worse! The beginning few days of his presidency have been filled with several fails (such as Mexico publicly stating that it’s not paying for Trump’s border wall, forcing U.S. taxpayers to foot the cost). They’ve also been filled with some of the biggest, most passionate protests we’ve ever seen.
A day after Trump’s pathetic, barely attended inauguration, the Women’s March on Washington took the spotlight by becoming the largest protest in history (estimated to be almost 3 million people). Not to mention, it was supported all over the world. That’s why you won’t find Trump on TIME Magazine’s February 8 cover – the magazine decided to give the spotlight to those who truly deserve it.

On the cover is the iconic pink “p*ssy hat”, which became a symbol for the Women’s March, alongside the headline “The Resistance Rises.”
Seriously, nothing is going to make Trump more upset to know that all the women and minorities that protested against him are being acknowledged more than him! Time’s Karl Vick said:
“There is no precedent in U.S. history for the show of collective outrage that answered Trump’s Inauguration. But then, there is no precedent for Trump.”
“Protest organizers actually calculated that framing the march as pro-women rather than anti-Trump would work wonders.”
And judging from the comments, people LOVE the new cover!

What influences American giving?,"July 24, 2017 9.16pm EDT
Americans make charitable donations for many reasons.

Americans make charitable donations for many reasons.
Several nonprofits, such as the Sierra Club, Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union, have reported a surge in donations as some Americans respond to their political concerns by supporting causes they believe will make a difference.
Yet while scholars have found ample evidence that economic conditions can shape charitable giving, the connection between overall donations and the political climate is less clear.
As the lead researcher responsible for the Giving USA report, which the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy researches and writes in partnership with the Giving USA Foundation, I have a unique opportunity to study how and why people give, and how those patterns unfold over time.
In the latest edition of Giving USA, we estimated that American individuals, estates, corporations and foundations donated a record US$390 billion to charitable causes in 2016.
Total giving grew 1.4 percent, adjusted for inflation. Donations from individuals amounted to nearly three-quarters of all giving and grew more than giving by foundations, corporations or bequests with a 2.6 percent gain to $282 billion.
A broad increase in what individual people donate could make a big difference in the amount of money Americans give overall to charity.
One way that the health of the economy shapes charitable giving is that people tend to give more money when they make more of it. Research by University of Chicago economist John A. List and other experts has found economic conditions – as measured by the S&P 500 stock index, personal consumption and the gross domestic product (GDP) – influence giving.
In one study, List and his colleague Yana Gallen found that giving rises when stocks rally. In fact, the S&P 500’s performance accounts for nearly 40 percent of the variation in annual charitable giving.
The money Americans gave to charity last year to support everything from houses of worship and homeless shelters to veterans’ organizations and art museums amounted to about 2.1 percent of GDP – the same share as for 2014 and 2015.
This measure has barely budged over the past 40 years. In 1976, during the Ford administration, charitable giving comprised 1.7 percent of the U.S. economy. Giving stood at 2.1 percent of GDP before the Great Recession, and only dipped to 1.9 percent before bouncing back.
The priorities of the American public are more diverse than ever, and that diversity is reflected in its giving habits. In 2016, donations to all of the nine major categories we track went up, for only the sixth time in the last 40 years.
What makes people change how and how much they give?
They may heed signals from their friends, relatives and other networks. We also know that people respond to requests to give and direct their gifts to causes and issues in which they believe they can have an impact. For instance, during the Great Recession, the philanthropists who make million-dollar donations shifted more of the money they give away to organizations that help the needy, according to a study I conducted with my colleagues.
There is also evidence that campaign contributions don’t replace charitable giving. In fact, fundraising research has found that donors who contributed to political campaigns during an election year actually gave more to nonprofits during an election year compared with the previous year.
We have, however, witnessed a shift in giving to groups devoted to animal welfare and environmental issues, as well as international affairs. These categories were so small that we couldn’t track them until 1987.
While they still draw less support than others – religious groups, at $123 billion, and educational institutions and organizations, at nearly $60 billion, still top the list – animal welfare and environment groups and international affairs organizations made big strides in 2016.
Specifically, giving to environment/animal organizations rose 5.8 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars to $11 billion in 2016 – faster than any other category. Giving to international affairs groups, such as Doctors without Borders, notably grew 4.6 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars to $22 billion. What’s impressive about this uptick is that there were few of the large-scale international disasters that usually drive that kind of philanthropy.
What else to watch
As many compelling studies have shown, there is a growing interest in how noneconomic factors influence donors, such as the desire for status or social pressure from fundraisers.
We have also found that taxation can have an impact. A recent study I co-authored found that two tax policy changes proposed by Congress and the Trump administration would reduce charitable giving. We also found that another tax policy shift that nonprofit leaders are advocating would increase donations.
And even if political concerns do change giving patterns in the short term, that trend might not persist over time. We’ll be tracking these developments in future editions of Giving USA.

Lying Muslim Cop Claims He Was Fired Due To 'Discrimination' — Sheriff Has Perfect Reply,"After accusing the Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings (right) and other officers of discrimination and Islamophobia, former deputy Waleed Albakri (left) received a brilliant reply he wasn’t expecting. (Photo source: Twitter, Orlando Sentinel)
After losing his job as a deputy at a Florida police department, an ex-cop immediately sued, claiming that his former coworkers had discriminated against him with racist and Islamophobic comments. As soon as the Sheriff was notified of the lawsuit, he offered a simple yet brilliant reply that utterly destroyed the accusation.
Although most Americans are well aware of the jihad involving horrific terrorist attacks, waging war against the infidels carries a broader definition that can be even more dangerous than outright violence. While these crimes are easily identifiable, stealth jihad that revolves around using our laws to erode our freedoms is much more effective in conquering a powerful Western nation. Unfortunately for one “peaceful” jihadist, his Sharia plot was quickly disrupted once the sheriff spoke up.
In November 2015, Waleed Albakri filed a civil rights lawsuit against the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, alleging that both his ex-coworkers and former employer displayed “Islamophobia” and harassed him for being a Muslim, WESH 2 reports. Albakri accused the non-Muslim officers of mocking him with comments such as “terrorist” and saying that he’d “never be an American.” He was also upset that the department had refused his demand for special accommodation to fast during the month of Ramadan. Subsequently, Albakri demanded monetary compensation for “emotional pain, suffering, and humiliation” as well as reinstatement as Deputy at the sheriff’s office. What he received instead probably wasn’t what he expected.
Instead of caving to Albakri’s outrageously entitled demands, the sheriff’s office quietly responded by providing the court and media with the Muslim ex-deputy’s sordid criminal record. Albakri’s history at the department includes several major instances of corruption and serious federal crimes that occurred while he was working as an officer of the law. Additionally, the sheriff’s office reminded the judge and news outlets that Albakri wasn’t complaining about harassment or discrimination until after he was fired for his crimes.
The Orlando Sentinel reports that a federal jury ultimately determined the Orange County Sheriff’s Office never harassed or discriminated against Albakri during his employment from 2008 to 2014, prompting the judge to rule in favor of the department. Albakri’s requests for damages and re-employment were denied, echoing a major failure in his nearly 2-year civil rights case.
“I just want to be reinstated,” Albakri said. “I want my name cleared, and I want the sheriff’s office to take responsibility for what their employees did. People knew about it because people were watching, and there were supervisors watching all of these actions. And guess what? No one did anything to end it.”
Although the media gushed over Albakri’s Medal of Merit, which he received for rescuing 2 children from an SUV in a pond in 2010, many overlooked his disreputable criminal history. In August 2012, Albakri was arrested for staging a home burglary to illegally collect payments for renter’s insurance from his insurance company. During this time, the authorities approved of dropping the charges if Albakri agreed to enter a pretrial diversion program to reprimand his behavior.
In 2014, Albakri was again arrested for insurance fraud but was given no option to negotiate a deal with the department. He was immediately fired after investigators again determined that he had schemed to defraud the insurance company, which the jury agreed was the reason for his discrimination suit.
“This organization decided to treat Waleed differently, because he was Muslim,” said Katherine Heffner, with the Council on American Islamic Relations.
Of course, Saudi-funded designated terrorist organization CAIR’s inflammatory accusation has a hidden meaning. The truth is that the organization didn’t treat Albakri differently but exactly the same as his non-Muslim coworkers. Albakri demanded to be treated differently because he was Muslim, believing he was entitled to special accommodation and privilege during his religious fasting. His religious supremacy peaked when he expected to be reinstated and given compensation after committing serious federal crimes while holding a respected position of immense legal authority.
Albakri’s entitlement and flagrant supremacy are not uncommon in the Muslim world. Despite making up a tiny minority, the Muslim population makes themselves appear much larger and more powerful by constantly making demands of the America people and threatening retaliation if they are denied.
The Quran proclaims that Muslims are superior to non-Muslims and, therefore, must subjugate them harshly until they feel subdued and obey Islamic law. Albakri was simply exacting his religious subjugation of his unbelieving counterparts in an effort to enforce Sharia law, which prohibits non-Muslims from even legitimate criticism of Islam.

Several Michigan legislators have weighed in on the finding to say it should act as a ""wake up call"" to protective action for the Great Lakes.

Silver carp captured in the Illinois Waterway on June 22, 2017 below T.J. O'Brien Lock and Dam. The fish was captured with a gill net by a contracted commercial fisher as part of the ACRCC Monitoring Response Work Group’s seasonal intensive monitoring event.

WASHINGTON — A live Asian carp was caught beyond electronic barriers meant to keep the invasive species out of the Great Lakes, just 9 miles from Lake Michigan, state and federal government officials confirmed Friday.
The Thursday capture of the silver carp — one of two invasive species collectively known as Asian carp — below the T.J. O'Brien Lock and Dam in Chicago immediately raised concerns that not enough is being done to keep the carp out of the Great Lakes.
“Today’s news is a wake-up call,"" said Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., who has been clamoring for controls, including possibly separating Lake Michigan from Chicagoland waterways, for a decade. ""We need to know how the silver carp came so close to Lake Michigan and whether there are any additional carp in the area.”
Henry Henderson, director of the Midwest Program for the National Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said Asian carp are like cockroaches.
“When you see one, you know it’s accompanied by many more you don't see,"" he said. “We have had 15 years to deal with this slow-motion tragedy.""

O'Brien Lock and Dam. (Photo: Illinois Department of Natural Resources)
Environmentalists, fishermen and others worry that the voracious carp, which were imported from Asia and have populated in the Mississippi River basin, will decimate habitat for other species if they infiltrate the Great Lakes. The recent find only heightened those concerns.
“The window of opportunity to protect the Great Lakes is closing,” said Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., who co-chairs the House Great Lakes Task Force. “If Asian carp are able to gain access and reproduce within the Great Lakes, the environmental and economic damage will be severe.""
The Illinois Department of Natural Resources and a consortium of local, state and federal agencies called the Asian Carp Regional Coordinating Committee announced the find Friday morning, saying the 8-pound, 28-inch-long silver carp was caught by gill net as part of its seasonal monitoring of waterways in the Chicago area.
It is only the second time in eight years of monitoring that a bighead or silver carp has been found beyond the electric dispersal barriers operated by the Army Corps of Engineers about 37 miles from Lake Michigan. In 2010, a bighead carp was caught in Lake Calumet not far from the T.J. O'Brien Lock and Dam.

No other evidence of Asian carp infesting waterways near Lake Michigan was found at that time. But there have been longstanding concerns about the effectiveness of the electronic dispersal barriers, especially after researchers showed evidence that smaller fish could be swept along through the barriers in the wake of larger barges.
The capture of the silver carp automatically triggers two additional weeks of intensive sampling in the area to determine whether there are others nearby. Late last year, the Free Press reported that the leading edge of the Asian carp's juvenile population was about 50 miles from Lake Michigan.
The regional coordinating committee sought to tamp down concerns, saying not enough is known to determine the seriousness of the find.
""It is important to note that this preliminary finding does not confirm that a reproducing population of Asian carp currently exists above the electric dispersal barriers or within the Great Lakes,"" the committee said in a statement.
Sam Finney of the U.S. Fish and Widlife Service narrates sonar video that shows fish swimming past the electric fish barrier in Chicago meant to keep Asian carp out of Lake Michigan.
The fight over what to do to keep Asian carp out of Lake Michigan has been waged for a decade, with officials in Michigan arguing that hydraulic separation may be needed to protect the Great Lakes. Business interests in Illinois and Indiana, meanwhile, have balked at such suggestions as well as others calling for barriers, saying they will impede inland waterway travel.
Stabenow and other members of Congress from Great Lakes states, including Michigan, Ohio and others, have also been clamoring for the Trump administration to release a report on how best to implement barriers at another key choke point on the waterways to Lake Michigan, at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam, in Joliet, Ill.
The Free Press first disclosed that the report — expected to be released by Feb. 28 — was ordered delayed by the Trump administration, though the reason is not known.
“The discovery of a live Asian carp just 9 miles from Lake Michigan and beyond the electric barriers makes it all the more critical that we add additional defenses,” said Mike Shriberg, executive director for the National Wildlife Federation’s Great Lakes Regional Center. “The electric barriers are not sufficient to stop Asian carp. ... We call upon the administration to release the draft study on improving defenses at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam without delay.""

North Korea says U.S. student's death a 'mystery to us as well',"FILE PHOTO - Otto Frederick Warmbier (C), a University of Virginia student who was detained in North Korea since early January, is taken to North Korea's top court in Pyongyang, North Korea, in this photo released by Kyodo March 16, 2016. Mandatory credit
Fred and Cindy Warmbier follow their son's, Otto Wambier, casket to the hearse after his funeral at Wyoming High School in Wyoming, Ohio, U.S. June 22, 2017.
FILE PHOTO: A person believed to be Otto Warmbier is transferred from a medical transport airplane to an awaiting ambulance at Lunken Airport in Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S., June 13, 2017.
SEOUL North Korea said on Friday the death of U.S. university student Otto Warmbier soon after his return home was a mystery and dismissed accusations that he had died because of torture and beating during his captivity as ""groundless"".
The North's foreign ministry spokesman said Warmbier was ""a victim of the policy of strategic patience"" of former U.S. President Barack Obama whose government never requested his release, according to comments carried by the official KCNA agency.
""The fact that Warmbier died suddenly in less than a week just after his return to the U.S. ... is a mystery to us as well,"" KCNA quoted the spokesman as saying.
Warmbier, 22, was arrested while visiting the reclusive country as a tourist. He was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for trying to steal an item bearing a propaganda slogan from his hotel, North Korean state media said.
He was sent home last week suffering from brain damage and in what U.S. doctors called a state of unresponsive wakefulness.. He died on Monday.
Katina Adams, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department’s East Asia Bureau, said Washington had repeatedly requested the release of Warmbier under the Obama administration.
His death fanned a conflict between the North and the United States that was already aggravated by North Korea's defiant missile launches and two nuclear tests since early last year as part of its effort to build a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.
A U.S. official said on Thursday that North Korea had conducted another test of a rocket engine believed to be linked to Pyongyang's ICBM program.
U.S. President Donald Trump blamed ""the brutality of the North Korean regime"" for Warmbier's death. South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who had advocated talks with the North, said Pyongyang had a ""heavy responsibility"" in the events leading up to the University of Virginia student's death.
The North's unnamed ministry spokesman said that such accusations were part of a smear campaign to slander the country that had given ""medical treatments and care with all sincerity"" to a person who was ""clearly a criminal"".
U.S. doctors who traveled to the North last week to bring Warmbier home recognized that the North had provided him with medical treatment, the spokesman said. ""To make it clear, we are the biggest victim of this incident.""
North Korea accepted repeated requests from the present U.S. administration, the spokesman said, and repatriated the student on humanitarian grounds ""in consideration of his bad health.""
The exact cause of Warmbier's death remains unclear. Officials at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, where he was treated after his return, declined to provide details. His family asked the local coroner not to perform an autopsy.
Thousands of friends and relatives gathered at Wyoming High School in suburban Cincinnati on Thursday for a memorial service for Warmbier, who graduated from the school as salutatorian in 2013.
After returning from a five-day trip to North Korea on June 17, former National Basketball Association star Dennis Rodman suggested on Friday that his visit may have had something to do with Pyonyang's decision to send the student home.
Rodman, who has faced ridicule and criticism for visiting North Korea in the past, has said he was trying to bring sports to the increasingly isolated country.
""I was just so happy to see the kid released,"" Rodman told ABC News in an interview. ""Some good things came of this trip.""
The United States has demanded North Korea release three other U.S. citizens it holds in detention: missionary Kim Dong Chul and academics Tony Kim and Kim Hak Song.

"Idiot Trump Supporters Now Shocked By His Planned Parenthood Agenda, Despite, Ya Know…Mike Pence","In a series of focus groups conducted by Planned Parenthood (through an independent research group) across Arizona, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, Trump supporters expressed dismay over the anti-abortion and anti-Planned Parenthood agenda being pushed by the man they elected into office.
Come January, when Republicans take control of the house, the Senate, and the Oval Office, the party is expected to—through their stated interest in repealing, in some form or another, the Affordable Care Act—cut $400 million in Medicaid funds to Planned Parenthood, effectively ending the organization’s tax funding.
(Note: Planned Parenthood’s federal funding does not go to abortion services.) While historically all over the place about his stance on a woman’s right to reproductive health, President-elect Donald Trump will likely sign on, especially given his VP Mike Pence’s history in this area.
This oddly comes as a surprise to the Trump voters in the focus groups. As the Huffington Post reports, one Wisconsin man stated,“The guy I voted for, I’d be disappointed if he signed it.
He’s making sure the Congress is on his side, but he doesn’t care about all us people who voted for him.”
An opportunist being opportunistic? Well, I never.
“If he does sign this, it’s gonna cause more disruption in our society,” said a man from Las Vegas and he’s right—access to reproductive healthcare (INCLUDING abortion) is a touchstone of most successful modern societies and Gilead the U.S. is no different.
Of all the Trump voters’ dismay, nothing was more flummoxing than a person from an Arizona focus group who seemingly has never googled Pence.
“I guess I’ve been living in a bubble. [Pence] sounds like a tyrant,” they remarked.
If only the bubble had been popped before the election and inevitable ruin of civilization.

Now that Senate Republicans have unveiled their health care bill, the party looks to corral its more skeptical members who feel the legislation doesn’t do away with enough provisions created under the Affordable Care Act.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell can only afford to lose two Republican votes if he’s is going to get his heath care bill passed, and he’ll almost certainly lose his counterpart Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky if changes are not made.
Paul was one of four conservative senators who quickly announced Thursday they’ll oppose the bill in its current form.
“The current bill does not repeal Obamacare,” Paul said in a statement. “It does not keep our promises to the American people. I will oppose it coming to the floor in its current form, but I remain open to negotiations.""
Paul, who leans libertarian, wants a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act, specifically calling for the removal of subsidies that are used to assist low-income plan members and Medicaid recipients. The new bill would change the payouts but keep many of the subsidies, and Paul said he believes it would end up costing more than Obamacare next year.
It’s going to be hard for conservatives to support a bill that has greater subsidies than Obamacare. That to me is really a non-starter.
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.
“It’s going to be hard for conservatives to support a bill that has greater subsidies than Obamacare,” Paul said. “That to me is really a non-starter.”
Many Republicans, including Paul, were left out of deliberations regarding the legislation, with party leaders holding several closed meetings over the past few weeks leading up to the reveal. Senators were briefed on the bill’s details Thursday morning, and McConnell said a vote is approaching next week pending a score from the Congressional Budget Office.
Three other conservatives, Mike Lee of Utah, Ted Cruz of Texas and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, also said Thursday they won’t support the bill in its current form but are open to negotiations.
Other wavering senators in McConnell’s caucus, such as moderate Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, worry the GOP’s plan would knock too many people off health insurance.
Paul also takes issue with Medicaid under the new Senate bill because of his home state’s experience, saying it was dishonest to tell people that the federal government would fund Medicaid expansion under Obamacare and then have the states bear part of the burden. He said Kentucky would have to weigh either cutting back on Medicaid or doubling the state income tax to fund it.
“If you want Medicaid, we have to agree how to pay for it,” Paul said.
From 2013 to February of this year, Kentucky’s Medicaid/CHIP enrollment increased 105 percent, the most of any state, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, which conducted a survey in 2015 that found 63 percent of Kentuckians have a favorable view of Medicaid expansion.
Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican who was elected in 2015, campaigned and promised to entirely cut Medicaid expansion but then softened his position, seeking a section 1115 waiver from the federal government that would allow the state to create its own version of Medicaid expansion. The waiver proposal is still under review.
“Kentucky has probably been helped more than any other state under Medicaid expansion,” said Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism at the University of Kentucky. “(Paul) knows the value of Medicaid.”
EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE
Although Medicaid expansion gave more Kentuckians the right to health care, Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute think tank, agrees with Paul’s assessment that increasing the number of people guaranteed care does not lead to those people receiving better or more affordable care.
Additionally, Cannon said he sees no value in subsidizing health plans that remain unaffordable for low-income plan members. “Senator Paul is absolutely right,” Cannon said. “The entire approach of Affordable Care Act is to throw government money and taxpayers’ dollars at unaffordable care rather than make care affordable.”
Paul said the Republican’s approach to drafting this bill was significantly rushed. In response he introduced legislation Wednesday that would require bills, amendments and conference reports to be filed one day for every 20 pages in advance before they can be considered by the Senate.
“If you do it on one side only, what you’re setting yourself up for is failure,” Paul said. “The public is not going to accept it if only one side does it.”

Did Macron Just Convince Trump to Reenter the Paris Agreement?,"The French president's charm offensive just might help save the planet.

The friendship between the United States and France goes way backâ€”all the way to 1775, when France secretly began sending supplies to the Americans during the Revolutionary War. In fact, France was the first ally of the new United States.Â (Of course, it helped that France was pretty angry at Great Britain over the territory it lost during the French and Indian War.)
Now, almost 250 years later, President Trump has ruffled some French feathers by pulling the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, signed by nearly 200 nations to limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5Â°C above pre-industrial levels. But newly minted French president Emmanuel Macron wasn't about to let Trump's pullout ruin a good friendshipâ€”something that was made abundantly clear when the two leaders met in Paris last week.
By many accounts, Macron is a true optimist. Perhaps his youth has something to do with his lack of negativity; at 39, he is France's youngest leader since Napoleon, and the first to be born after 1958. His predecessor and former boss Francois Hollande said Macron ""radiated joy"" when he worked for him, an odd statement considering Hollande's dour disposition. (The Telegraph's William Langley once called the ex-president ""a politician with the personality of bread mold."")
""An almost preternaturally sunny demeanour, combined with his winning way with words, has been the new president's magic formula,"" writes Hugh Schofield, the Paris correspondent for BBC News. He also noted that Macron's ""resplendent"" personality was going to be ""tested like never before.""
Well, Macron may have just aced the Trump test. And he did it by launching a charm offensive that allowed him not only to forcefully address their main point of contentionâ€”Trump's controversial withdrawal from the Paris climate agreementâ€”but to get Trump to soften his climate stance, something no other politician, American or otherwise, has yet accomplished.
In a Sunday interview with the French newspaper Journal du Dimanche, Macron said he pressed Trump on the possibility of bringing America back into the agreement.
""Donald Trump listened to me,"" Macron said, according to AP. ""He understood the reason for my position, notably the link between climate change and terrorism."" The French president added: ""He said he would try to find a solution in the coming months. We spoke in detail about what could allow him to return to the Paris deal.""
During a joint news conference after the meeting, Trump said ""something could happen with respect to the Paris accord...We'll see what happens. But weâ€™ll talk about that in the coming period of time. If it happens, that will be wonderful. If it doesnâ€™t, thatâ€™s okay, too.""
Perhaps Franceâ€”and for that matter, Europeâ€”has found a ""Trump whisperer"" in Macron, who also said during his interview Sunday that he believes Trump left the country with a ""better image of France than upon his arrival."" (Angela Merkel, take note.)
""Our countries are friends, so we should be too,"" Macron said, adding his belief that after their meeting, the two leaders gained a ""better, intimate knowledge of each other.""
When they met, Trump and Macron shared a seemingly neverending handshake. Hopefully, they'll soon be shaking hands to celebrate America's reentry to the Paris agreement. To Monsieur Macron, we say,Â Bonne chance!

Joe Biden dodges questions about 2020 presidential race,"Joe Biden dodges questions about a possible 2020 presidential run
Vice President Joe Biden waves as he concludes a speech at Georgetown University in Washington, Dec. 5, 2016.
Manuel Balce Ceneta, AP
Former Vice President Joe Biden on Saturday deflected questions about whether he plans to run for president in 2020.
""My focus now, our focus now, is to get a Democratic Congress elected in 2018,"" he said at an event called OZY Fest in New York City's Central Park, according to video uploaded by The Hill newspaper.
Katie Couric interviewed his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, on stage at the event, and also threw a question about his future to Joe Biden in the audience.
""There's a lot of talent in the Democratic Party,"" he said. ""My hope and expectation is that some of the younger folks are going to come up and they're going to fill that void.
""But if they don't... Jill's running,"" he joked.
In May, Biden left the door open to a 2020 run, but suggested it was unlikely.
""I may very well do it,"" Biden said at a SALT hedge fund conference in Las Vegas, according to CNN. ""Could I? Yes. Would I? Probably not.""
He then launched a new political action committee called American Possibilities PAC, which is dedicated to electing people who believe the U.S. is about dreaming big.
In June, Biden's brother Frank said in an interview that the former vice president ""absolutely"" has enough energy for another presidential run.
""Why anyone would think otherwise, I don't know,"" he said. ""And there are a whole lot of people down here in Florida looking forward to it.""
If he were to run in four years, Biden would turn 78 years old just after the election. He served as President Obama's vice president from 2009 until this past January. He previously served in the Senate from 1973 until 2009. He ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008.

"After an Attack on a Bus of Hindu Pilgrims in India, a Muslim Driver Saves Lives and a Politician Saves Government Dignity","Seven people died, but the fallout could have been much worse in a country tense with religious violence.
July 24, 2017, 12:59 PM GMT
Sept. 20, 2015: Bus on the high altitude Leh road to Lamayuru on Leh Ladakh, India.

Two things will be remembered about the responses to the attack in India on a bus full of Hindu pilgrims returning from the Amarnath shrine late on July 10: The heroism of the bus driver and the unexpectedly reasonable statement made by Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Home Minister Rajnath Singh. The statement was one of condolence, without jumping to villainizing/generalizing about India’s Kashmir Muslims.
As the bus was on its way from Baltal to Jammu, in the conflict-ridden state of Jammu and Kashmir, militants opened fire and seven pilgrims lost their lives. Salim Mirza Shaikh, the driver of the bus, a Muslim from the western Indian state of Gujarat, drove the pilgrims and the bus to safety even as terrorists in uniform showered bullets in the dark of night. According to the Indian Express, egged on by his colleagues who also took bullets, “Salim drove for nearly two kilometers on the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway before he reached an army camp."" As he told the Indian Express:
“It was about 8pm when the bus was surrounded by terrorists. They first fired from the front with the intention to eliminate the driver. I ducked sideways to escape the bullets and drove ahead. I do not know how I got the strength to go on at that time. Maybe Allah helped me and gave me strength.”
“It was all due to Baba Amarnath’s blessings that I got the strength despite guns blazing around me,” Salim added, invoking Hinduism to the Indian media even though he is Muslim, in an example of India’s unique religious syncretism.
Salim’s hometown of Gujarat is embedded with a politically inspired hardline Hindu identity. (Gujarat has been an experiment for the Hindutva right wing for three decades, also remembered also for a reprisal of the pogrom of Muslims, following arson on the coach of a train at Godhra, carrying, among others, political-religious activists.) Salim said he escaped unharmed in the incident while another passenger seated beside him was injured. As a result, 50 others who potentially could have died, remained unharmed. It was a small silver lining for India. By early afternoon on July 12, Salim was a hero, and social media had, for once, done an exemplary job, silencing bitterness and hatred expressed through paid trolls.
The pilgrims had come under attack late Monday after they were traveling to Jammu in a Gujarat vehicle, on National Highway 1A, the only route connecting the valley to rest of the country, after completing the Amarnath pilgrimage. The Amarnath pilgrimage itself, while having a long history, has been carefully promoted by the Indian state, especially those aligned to a hard-line Hindutva model of it, since the 1980s, exacerbated in 2008-2010 when state land was handed over to the Shrine Board.
According to Jammu and Kashmir police, the July 10 terror attack was aimed at the police post. The police said the terrorists had initially attacked a police bulletproof bunker near the Botengo village, reports the Indian Express. “The fire was retaliated and there was no report of injuries,” a police official said. The official added that the terrorists fired on a police post near Khanabal locality in District Anantnag. “The fire was retaliated and a tourist bus was hit by bullets,” he said.
As the day wore on and condemnations on the attack poured in, the high office of India’s home minister, Rajnath Singh, provided another silver lining.
“All Kashmiris are not terrorists,” Rajnath Singh tweeted, shutting down one such troll. Singh saluted the people of Jammu and Kashmir who had condemned the attack on Amarnath pilgrims and kept the spirit of Kashmiriyat alive. Describing the attack as a “cowardly act of terror,” Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that all sections in Kashmir had condemned the attack, which “shows the spirit of Kashmiriyat is also very much alive.”
According to the Indian Express, the home minister, in a gesture that is being widely welcomed as salutary:
“took to Twitter to react strongly to a tweet from @shuchikalra, who responded to his remark on Kashmiriyat by posting: ‘Who gives a f*** about the spirit of Kashmiriyat at this moment? It is not your job to placate. Just drag those cowards out and cull them.’
Singh, whose official handle was tagged in that tweet, posted: ‘Ms Kalra I certainly do. It is absolutely my job to ensure peace and tranquility in all parts of the country. All Kashmiris are not terrorists.’ Following this, the Twitter account, listed under the name Shuchi Singh Kalra, was found deleted.”
Screengrab of Kalra’s tweet, which has since been deleted. (Indian Express)
After a long time, the office of the Home Minister of India was restored to its intended dignity.
The Jammu and Kashmir government has announced a monetary award (a total of Rs 3 lakhs) to Salim for his exemplary bravery, and the chief minister of Gujarat, Vijay Rupani, even said that he would recommend Salim Shaikh’s name for a special award for bravery. That providentially, Salim, the bus driver who drove the rest of the Hindu pilgrims to safety, was a Muslim, put a cap on the hate and vitriol (inevitably against Indian Muslims) likely to have been otherwise let loose or legitimized by the terror attack.
Bomb terror has the ugly potential of polarizing neighborhoods and evoking stark reactions from those affected by grief. When this is fueled by a cynical politics, that thrives on hatred and communal polarization, India, through Salim and Rajnath Singh, rose above this. The recent #NotInMyName protests organized in Delhi at India Gate, the Mumbai protests at Mira Road and another protest by Muslim and other civil rights organizations at Azad Maidan on July 12, again united Indians in their grief and outrage against bomb terror.
Condemnations poured in from all quarters even while the Jammu and Kashmir government had to resort to shutting down the internet services in the state to avoid any flare up of the communal situation; traders observed a protest shut down in Jammu, the state’s winter capital, against the attack on pilgrims in the valley. The authorities also closed all educational institutions in Jammu region as a precautionary measure.
Politicians of all hues condemned the militant attack on the pilgrims and expressed sorrow over the killings. Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, otherwise criticized of her handling of the rights violations against her own people over the past 18 months, said, “Yatris (pilgrims) were esteemed guests of Kashmir and perpetrators of this crime have done a death blow to the ethos and culture of the state.”
The Communist Party of India Marxist issued a press statement condemning the attack.
“The Polit Bureau of the CPI(M) denounces the dastardly attack on Amarnath pilgrims in Anantnag district in Jammu and Kashmir. Seven people, mostly women, were killed and 19 injured in a terrorist attack while returning from the pilgrimage,” the statement said. The general secretary of the party, Sitaram Yechury, had earlier in the day tweeted a query: “How come the last time that the Amarnath yatris were attacked it was during the BJP-led NDA rule in 2000?” That attack was even more brutal than the one that took place on July 10. In the 2000 attack, 80 lives were lost, including pilgrims and jawaans who tried to save them.
The 2017 terror attack on pilgrims was strongly condemned by others as well, including former Chief Minister Omar Abdullah of National Conference and Sonia Gandhi, president of the Indian National Congress, who called it a “crime against humanity.” Prominent citizens and bureaucrats also issued a statement condemning the killing. Clearly for large sections of Indians, the potential of an intracommunity flare-up, resulting in innocent lives lost, drove the concerned reactions.
The only discordant notes predictably came from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP)—the VHP president, Pravin Togadia, called for a boycott of Kashmiri products and Muslims—including “urging the Indian government not to give ‘them’ jobs in the Army and security forces and Shiv Sena chief in Mumbai asked ‘for gau rakshaks’ (cow vigilantes) to be sent to fight terrorists.” Togadia even “demanded” that any or all Kashmiri Muslims serving in the Indian armed forces should be “immediately dismissed.”
But that is to be expected, given that hard-line Hindutva outfits like the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Shiv Sena's political currency is a barter of division and hatred. Togadia has consistently played out his revenge politics in his home state of Gujarat. When a strikingly similar attack in 2000 took place against Hindu pilgrims to Amarnath, killing 80, he held a press conference over 1,000 kilometers away, in Ahmedabad, where he said, loud and clear, ""We will respond to this attack, here."" Over the next three days, from Surat in the south of Gujarat to Khed Bharma in the north, attacks on minority properties were engineered, with VHP and Bajrang Dal men at the forefront. The loss of property was carefully documented in a collective Citizen’s Report.
There are some other interesting details to the story, including why an Amarnath Yatra, ill advised due to the severe situation in the valley, was allowed at the last minute and the fact that, as reported by the Hindustan Times, the Jammu and Kashmir police had arrested an Uttar Pradesh man who allegedly helped Pakistan-based terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) attack army convoys, snatch weapons and loot lakhs of rupees.
Brinda Karat, polit bureau of the CPI9M, in her regular blog on NDTV.com, took the argument raised by the general secretary of the party, Yechury, further. “There have not been such direct attacks on the Yatra for the last 15 years,” she said. “The last time such horrific attacks took place on the Amarnath Yatra were in the three consecutive years of 2000, 2001 and 2002 when the Vajpayee government was ruling at the center and its then-ally, the National Conference, was ruling the state.”
Also important was the question of why the pilgrimage was allowed in the first place, when the normally much-maligned Indian intelligence services had 10 days before warned of such a brutal attack. On June 28, NDTV.com carried the story and clearly echoed the warning: “The annual Amarnath Yatra in Kashmir which begins today is facing a terror threat, according to an intelligence warning which has prompted the authorities to mobilise the ‘highest level’ of security measures, including satellite tracking system.""
Other sections of the Indian media, including the Hindustan Times, maintained a balance by also raising serious and sharp questions on the legal and procedural norms followed by the bus, whether it had been registered by the Amarnath Board (a quasi-government authority set up to handle issues related to this pilgrimage), how it had managed to drive through several security check posts, and why it was allowed to travel after sunset. The questions are serious, and the hyped-up atmosphere around ‘terror’ attacks in India and the hard-line approach of the present Indian government in Kashmir, are unlikely to provide any reasonable answers.
It is just as crucial to appreciate where India stands in terms of terms of the Indian public discourse at present. When, after months of studied silence, the response of the Indian Home Minister, belonging to the same party as the ruling BJP, prompted hate on Twitter, the followers of his own ideology, the faithful behind Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi viciously trolled him. The influence that hate-ridden targeting plays in swaying Indian public discourse today is staggering.
But for now, it is worth our while to savor the day and the victory of the sheer power of decency displayed in the actions of Salim Mirza and India’s Home Minister Rajnath Singh.

BREAKING: Mueller Was Just Implicated – Here’s The Sickening Reason Why,"And here it comes, folks…. It appears that Wikileaks has the goods on Mueller and they have just released them.
Even though it wasn’t bad enough that Robert Mueller, who is the special prosecutor in the liberal media created myth that is the fake Trump/Russia Collusion scandal, has been found to have ties to the Trump family because of his former law firm, WilmerHale, which represents Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. According to Wikileaks, it now seems that Mueller is also being implicated in a 2009 Uranium deal between the Barack Hussein Obama administration and Russia.
Special Prosecutor Robert Muelller flew to Moscow and gave the FSB 10 grams of Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) in 2009 https://t.co/mNdcTa7boQ pic.twitter.com/nPjFSKPHWQ
— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) July 29, 2017
Yup, you read that correctly folks. The real collision here was between then President Obama, his Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the man who is now supposed to be impartial in his investigation of Trump and the myth that is the Russia collision. Only in Politics.
The Wikileaks document reads:
TRENDING ON FREEDOM DAILY
2009 AMBASSADOR BEYRLE E-MAIL D. 08 MOSCOW
Classified By: EUR/PRA: KATHLEEN MORENSKI
PER E.O. 12958: REASONS 1.4 (A) AND (G).
1. (SBU) This is an action request: Embassy Moscow please
see para 6 and 7; and Embassy Tbilisi please see para 8.
2. (S/NF) Background: Over two years ago Russia requested a
ten-gram sample of highly enriched uranium (HEU) seized in
early 2006 in Georgia during a nuclear smuggling sting
operation involving one Russian national and several Georgian
accomplices. The seized HEU was transferred to U.S. custody
and is being held at a secure DOE facility. In response to
the Russian request, the Georgian Government authorized the
United States to share a sample of the material with the
Russians for forensic analysis. Director Mueller previously
planned to deliver the sample in April (Ref A), but due to a
scheduling conflict the trip was canceled. Embassy Moscow
LegAtt informed the FSB prior to Mueller’s intended April
delivery and received confirmation that the FSB would take
custody of the sample after the Director’s plane landed. EST
Moscow also informed Rosatom of the planned transfer and that
the U.S. placed a high priority on completing this transfer
(Ref B). Once the LegAtt told FSB counterparts the April
been canceled, Ambassador Beyrle informed Igor Neverov (Ref
C), who said that he understood but was disappointed the trip
was postponed. The September 21 visit provides again an
opportunity to deliver the requested ten-gram sample from the
seized HEU in order to obtain cooperation from the GOR on
this nuclear smuggling case and to eventually establish a
more productive mechanism of U.S.-Russian cooperation on
3. (S/NF) While there was a reasonable exchange of
information with Russian security services at the time of the
2006 seizure, we have had poor cooperation investigating the
diversion of HEU, which the United States believes was stolen
from a Russian facility. Russia did not respond to papers
that then Acting U/S Rood provided Deputy Foreign Minister
Ryabkov in December 2008 reiterating the USG position that
Russia should pick up this sample in the United States.
Further, when asked for an update on their response to our
proposal, Ryabkov told us in early 2009 in Washington that
there was an interagency dispute over who would come and pick
4. (S/NF) Given Russia’s reluctance to act so far, FBI
Mueller’s delivery of this sample will underscore to Russia
our commitment to follow through on this case. While some
details related to the sharing of information on smuggling
networks may be too sensitive to discuss, delivery of the
sample could enable us to discuss whether Russian authorities
investigated the diversion and prosecuted anyone. Moreover,
we hope it will spark discussions on mechanisms to exchange
information and material on future incidents of this nature,
particularly in light of the commitments made in the July
summit U.S.-Russia Joint Statement on Nuclear Cooperation
regarding strengthening our cooperation to stop acts of
nuclear terrorism. Posts should note that DOE/NNSA’s April
2009 determination authorizing distribution of the sample to
the Russian Federation only for attribution of the sample in
support of a criminal investigation is applicable to the
proposed September 21 delivery of the sample to Russia.
5. (S/Rel Russia) Background con’t: On April 16, the FSB
verbally confirmed to Legatt that we will have no problem
with the Russian Ministry of Aviation concerning Mueller’s
flight (although we probably won’t see paperwork until
shortly before the trip). The FBI is requiring that the
sample be turned over to a Russian law enforcement authority
(i.e., FSB) as opposed to an intelligence service (i.e., SVR)
or technical authority (i.e., Rosatom). A representative
from the responsible Russian Law Enforcement authority, who
will accept custody of the sample, must be identified and
verified ahead of time. That individual will be required to
have signatory authority to accept the sample. Appropriate
arrangements need to be made to ensure the transfer of
material is conducted at the airport, plane-side, upon
arrival of the Director’s aircraft. Post should also remind
the GOR that this is the material about which the GOR gave
the USG nonproliferation assurances in 2008 in a diplomatic
note from February 2008 (Ref D).
6. (S/Rel Russia) Action request: Embassy Moscow is
requested to alert at the highest appropriate level the
Russian Federation that FBI Director Mueller plans to deliver
the HEU sample once he arrives to Moscow on September 21.
Post is requested to convey information in paragraph 5 with
regard to chain of custody, and to request details on Russian
Federation’s plan for picking up the material. Embassy is
also requested to reconfirm the April 16 understanding from
the FSB verbally that we will have no problem with the
Russian Ministry of Aviation concerning Mueller’s September
7. (S/Rel Russia) Post is requested to deliver the following
–We wish to inform you that FBI Director Mueller plans to
arrive in Moscow on the evening of September 21 with a
ten-gram sample of seized HEU, which you requested for
–We regret that the April visit by Director Mueller could
not take place due to a scheduling conflict. We would be
grateful once again for the Russian Federation’s willingness
to receive the sample and facilitate the logistics for its
–As before, we require confirmation that a representative
from a responsible Russian law enforcement authority will be
available to accept custody of the sample and have signatory
authority to accept the sample.
–We require that the transfer of this material be conducted
at the airport, on the tarmac near by the plane, upon arrival
of the Director’s aircraft.
–We place a high priority on completion of this sample
transfer to facilitate your forensic analysis of the
–Further, with the delivery of this sample, we hope to
collaborate more closely on promoting a more effective
relationship between our law enforcement organizations to
counter illicit trafficking of nuclear materials.
–In particular, such efforts were underscored in the July
Summit joint presidential statement on nuclear cooperation
regarding our commitments to strengthen cooperation to stop
acts of nuclear terrorism. Securing vulnerable nuclear
materials and improving nuclear security within our two
countries is our highest priority.
— It is our hope to eventually establish a more systematic
mechanism to facilitate U.S.-Russian cooperation on
investigations into nuclear smuggling cases. We continue to
believe that Russia should be concerned by the prospect that
HEU was diverted from one of its facilities, and should
actively investigate the incident.
8. (S/Rel Georgia) For Embassy Tbilisi: No action is
required at this point. As before, State will send
instructions at the appropriate time on alerting the Georgian
Government when the transfer of the seized HEU is imminent
and in Russian custody.
9. (U) Department thanks Post for its assistance.

All this just goes to prove once again that the left just can’t seem to fathom the idea that their candidate, Crooked Hillary Clinton, got shellacked by an outsider like Donald J. Trump. They will never give up the fight. Since they can’t beat Republicans in the arena of ideas that’s what they do to win. That’s how they rally their troops. It’s all about mob rule over substance.
I find it unconscionable that we have a special prosecutor for this fake narrative but we never had one when President Barack Hussein Obama and Crooked Hillary Clinton decided to leave our ambassador and 3 Navy Seals to die in Benghazi? Nor when he was found to be using the IRS as a weapon to take out his political enemies such as the Tea Party?
Oh yeah, that’s right, the American Lame Stream Media was too busy carrying his water to actually do its job and sound the alarm that Barry Obama was doing what Richard Nixon couldn’t even do in his wildest dreams.

Anthony Scaramucci Made The Reporter Who Attacked Sarah Huckabee Apologize,"Anthony Scaramucci is the kind of person that doesn’t take crap from anyone, and now when one rude reporter insulted Sarah Huckabee Sanders by calling her a “butch queen in drag,” Scaramucci taught him a lesson that he won’t forget anytime soon.
Madison Ill, Daily Beast gay rights advocate reporter, tweeted a picture of the new press secretary Sarah Huckabee with a caption, “Butch Queen first time in drags at the ball.” With this comment, he was suggesting that Sander is a drag queen. And it is important to be noted that this isn’t his first time of offending someone like this. Madison also attacked Jeff Sessions when he heard that Sessions granddaughter is an Asian, he tweeted “Sessions, Sir, kindly return this Asian baby from the ‘Toys R Us’ you stole her from,” along with a photograph of him holding his granddaughter in his lap.
Scaramucci gave few days to see if the mainstream media would do something to show him that these kinds of attacks are not acceptable, but as expected no outlet like CNN, MSNBC, CBS, or ABC reported on this.
Daily Wire reported, “The fact that a journalist who works for a major online publication attacked a sitting press secretary in such a demeaning and public way is of course news. And yet a good faith look through the Google machine shows that not a single mainstream media outlet picked the story up. Not one.”
After this Scaramucii respectfully wrote on Twitter that Madison has to apologize to Sarah Huckabee, and a few hours later Madison did apologize to Sanders, this is his first apology ever. Even though we don’t know Scaramucci’s behind the scenes message, it surely was powerful since Madison wrote this:
Apologies to Sarah H. Sanders for the ill-judged joke tweeted Fri, deleted this AM. I didn't mean to offend anyone & I'm sorry that I did!
— Ira Madison III (@ira) July 25, 2017
Scaramucci taught Maddison and the rest of the liberal press that these kinds of attack are not acceptable and will not be tolerated. Scaramucci also fired one of the leakers, Michael Shorts, from the White House communications office.
Anthony Scaramucci is not a person you can play with. After CNN reported a fake story about him, Scaramucci and his attorneys scared CNN that they withdraw the story instantly.

Mr. Scaramucci I laud you for doing this, I tip my hat to you, for defending those who are attacked.
These morons who do such gut-wrenchings need to be taught their actions will no longer be tolerated.
These loons are impacting real Americans will real feeling of reprisals on the loons and that will also should not be tolerated either.
However Mr. Scaramucci, you have all the tools necessary at your finger tips, to dispense the corrections on the morons, the loons, etc. As an example, Mr. Ira Madison Ill could wake up one morning to find a Certified letter from the IRS waiting for him. Humm, how could that happen? Maybe others similar in nature to Mr. Ira Madison Ill will begin a period of safety traffic stops by his local authorities. Humm, how could that happen? A logical person who gets stopped a few times a week, when was has not been stopped for quite some time just might get the impression someone is watching his step, sending a message, and how could that happen? Thanks for you being there Mr. Scaramucci, we the Deplorable Americans need a man like you.

The conservative commentator Ann Coulter unleashed a barrage of criticism about Delta Air Lines on Twitter after she was moved to a different seat on a flight on Saturday, prompting the company to publicly return fire and call her comments “unnecessary and unacceptable.”
Ms. Coulter, a pundit known for headline-grabbing comments, began her attack after a flight from La Guardia Airport in New York to West Palm Beach, Fla.
In a statement on Sunday, the airline described what happened as a “seat mix-up,” but Ms. Coulter excoriated the airline in social media posts after she was removed from a seat that she said she had specifically booked.
.@Delta didn’t give my extra room seat to an air marshall or tall person. Here’s the woman given my PRE-BOOKED seat: pic.twitter.com/iDNB8xXXOd
.@Delta motto: ""How can we make your flight more uncomfortable?""
She went on to complain about the flight’s Wi-Fi, commenting that JetBlue offers it for free and “doesn’t wantonly remove passengers from their assigned seats, booked in advance FOR A REASON.”

She added, “@Delta sucks.”
Ms. Coulter went on to complain that Delta “spends all this $$$ on beautiful aircraft & then hire Nurse Ratchets as flight attendants & gate agents,” a reference to Nurse Ratched, the character known to be an overly strict enforcer of the rules in “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.”

She even posted on Twitter a photo of the passenger she said had taken her seat.
In a statement, repeated on Twitter, the airline criticized Ms. Coulter for “posting derogatory and slanderous comments and photos in social media” about its employees and customers. Delta said it was “disappointed” in Ms. Coulter and called her actions “unnecessary and unacceptable.”
The airline said it would refund her $30 for the preferred seat she bought, adding, “Delta expects mutual civility throughout the entire travel experience.”
She ridiculed the $30 refund, saying on Twitter that it cost her $10,000 of her time to select the seat she wanted, investigate the type of plane and periodically review seat options.
In an email on Monday, she wrote: “I spent time ‘reserving’ — that term has a flexible meaning at Delta — a specific seat, and that’s my hourly rate. I looked up the aircraft, considered my options and booked the seat I wanted. I checked back to see how the flight was filling up to review my options again. I had reasons for choosing 15D, not 15A, or any other seat.”
The airline’s statement appeared only to incense Ms. Coulter, who continued the fight late into Sunday night and early Monday morning.
But I love @Delta declaring my tweets unacceptable. @Delta now dictating acceptable conduct off the plane. NOT fascist at all. #Resist https://t.co/w3fpEmu3z8
Okay, @Delta, just sweetness & light from me. pic.twitter.com/sckEI6ddf0
She wrote on Twitter: “I have been the picture of politeness. If I treated customers they way @Delta does, I’d deem ‘facts’ impolite, too.”
In her email, she complained that it was not enough for “Delta to boss customers around when we’re in their control.”
“Now they’re policing our behavior after we’re off the plane,” she wrote. “Perhaps they should spend less time sneering at their customers’ post-flight commentary and more time investigating why they invite customers to prebook their seats online, only for their gate agents to go into the computer, cancel a reserved seat, print new tickets, and give a prebooked seat to another customer, who apparently wanted the same seat — but not quite enough to bother booking it in advance.”

In its statement, the airline said that Ms. Coulter had originally booked seat 15F, which was by the window in an exit row, but that within 24 hours of the flight’s departure, she changed to seat 15D, which is by the aisle.

“At the time of boarding, Delta inadvertently moved Coulter to 15A, a window seat, when working to accommodate several passengers with seating requests,” the statement said. “When there was some confusion with seating assignments during boarding, a flight attendant stepped in and asked that all of the passengers move to the seats noted on their respective tickets. All customers complied and the flight departed without incident.”
Ms. Coulter complained that the airline did not communicate the seat change before boarding.
“I was in the boarding area 90 minutes before the flight took off, but I was never called to the counter and asked to switch seats,” she wrote in the email.
The airline said that what started out as a complaint had turned into a “public attack” on its employees and customers.
Delta said it had learned about her complaint only after she began tweeting after the flight landed. The company said its social media and customer service workers tried several times to contact her to apologize but did not hear from her until Sunday night.

"Natural rubber production splurges up to 8.7%, may touch 8 lakh tonne","Production in the first two months of the current fiscal is 98,000 tonne, an increase of 15.3%.
The production of natural rubber (NR) during May 2017 has logged a surge of 8.7 % as compared to that in the same period last year. Production during May 2017 is being reported at 50,000 tonne, while it was 46,000 tonne in May 2016. Production in the first two months of the current fiscal is 98,000 tonne, an increase of 15.3% as compared to 85,000 tonne during the same period last year. Anticipated production for the current year is 8 lakh tonne, said a spokesperson of Rubber Board, here. With the help of RPSs (Rubber Producers’ Societies), the board has been continuing its activities to make rubber cultivation remunerative by increasing production, productivity and reducing cost of cultivation & production, said release by the board.
The board’s annual mass contact programme had about 50,000 participants in 800 meetings conducted at various rubber growing areas as part of the mass contact programme. Practices such as weekly tapping, controlled upward tapping, rain-guarding, online fertiliser recommendation, scheme for intercropping, rubber tapper skill development programme under Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) have been activated.
The second phase for training for 22,000 persons in rubber tapping and processing in Kerala, Tripura, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, under PMKVY has also commenced. In the first phase of the training programme, 10,000 persons were trained. The impact assessment of already conducted programmes shows positive effects in productivity. According to the board, the pending rubber plantation subsidy to the tune of Rs 60 lakh has been released. Another amount of Rs 40 lakh will be released shortly.

"Setback for Essar Steel, Gujarat HC junks plea against RBI insolvency order","Essar Steel had sought relief from the HC by challenging the RBI’s June 13 circular that asked banks to initiate action against the company and 11 other accounts with over Rs 5,000 crore of outstanding loans each under the IBC.
The Gujarat High Court on Monday dismissed the plea of Essar Steel against the Reserve Bank of India for including it in the list of 12 accounts for resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The development is significant as the government’s move to tackle the bad debt issue can now carry on unabated. With the dismissal of the case, Essar Steel’s lenders — a joint lenders’ forum (JLF) led by State Bank of India (SBI), and Standard Chartered Bank — can now proceed against the company in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
In fact, the matter will come up for hearing in the NCLT Ahmedabad bench on Tuesday.
Essar Steel had sought relief from the HC by challenging the RBI’s June 13 circular that asked banks to initiate action against the company and 11 other accounts with over Rs 5,000 crore of outstanding loans each under the IBC. Essar’s contention was that this directive was improper in its case, as the company was at an advanced stage of loan restructuring and any such step would not only hamper its operations but also delay its discussion with banks for a resolution.
However, the single-judge bench of justice SG Shah dismissed the plea on the ground that Essar Steel had not challenged the IBC but instead said that it being dragged to the NCLT would result in a drastic impact on its day-to-day functioning. Shah in his 83-page order said that a banking company is entitled to initiate insolvency proceedings without the directions of the RBI.
“Provisions of IBC may be drastic to some extent, but since it is part of statute which is yet not declared unconstitutional and therefore they are to be followed,” the order noted. It said that whatever issue Essar Steel has can be raised in the NCLT, which is the appropriate legal forum in the matter.
“Refusal of interim relief is obvious because the petitioner company (Essar Steel) is in debt of more than Rs 45,000 crore for a couple of years, its NPA (non-performing asset) was more than Rs 32,000 crore in last year and more than `31,000 crore in previous year. It is also clear that when total debt is more than Rs 45,000 crore, there is no option but to leave the issue at the discretion of the lenders to take appropriate steps in accordance with law, thereby without interference of this court under the constitutional mandate,” the order noted.
Signalling that it would not challenge the single bench’s order, Essar Steel in a statement said, “We respect the decision of the High Court and will accordingly be raising these issues for consideration by the NCLT.”
The RBI’s step against Essar Steel had come after the government had suitably empowered it through an amendment in the Banking Regulation Act. Its circular was based on the criterion that the total banking exposure of the company should be at least Rs 5,000 crore and 60% of this exposure should have turned non-performing as of March 2016.
Essar Steel owes lenders around Rs 45,000 crore, of which Rs 31,671 crore became non-performing as of March 31, 2016.
According to the norms, once the case is with the NCLT, the lenders need to set up a committee of creditors that will come up with a plan on how the asset will be tackled. If the committee is unable to find a solution within 180 days, this can be extended to 270 days. After 270 days, the company will go into liquidation.",Financial Express,0

Just over three years ago,   pioneered a new form of digital journalism by deploying our unique technology to tell award-winning stories across a range of formats, including on our website, social media and television. We’ve had tremendous success and our industry has taken notice.
Since then, we’ve seen a shift in digital publishing in favor of distribution on social media and other platforms, along with a dramatic increase in demand for captivating video content. Additionally, streaming services and program providers are investing billions of dollars to fulfill a market demand for original, long-form programming. For  , this is an opportunity we plan to seize.
Today, we are announcing that   will shift to an all-video format. We are tripling our investment in video and establishing a dedicated unit to create compelling video content, from mini docs to docu-series and feature-length films.
We will distribute via social channels and platforms, as well as through partnerships with television networks, OTT players and others. Our new programming and partnerships – which we will reveal in more detail in the coming weeks – will be exclusive, global and technology-driven, focusing on both historical features and current events, as well as on subject areas in which we can deploy our IoT and deep web analytics technology, such as raw, unscripted series and sports programming. We believe this focus on video will be the most important strategic shift for our business since its inception.
As you know,   is not new to video.  -branded videos are widely viewed and the work we’ve produced for MSNBC, Discovery, TLC as well as other brands has garnered awards and captivated fans. The first two seasons of “DARK NET” attracted excellent reviews and strong viewership for Showtime, and the content we’ve produced through   Films has had an incredibly positive impact on our business. This is the foundation we will build upon.
This means that we will be phasing out written stories. We want to assure you this is not a decision we made lightly given the impact it will have on the team. On behalf of our entire leadership team, I want to personally thank each and every one of you for your contributions and for the dedication and distinction with which you have served our audiences.

Moscow steps up war of words in diplomatic row with U.S,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov speaks during a meeting with Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit in Moscow, Russia, July 5, 2017.
MOSCOW Moscow on Tuesday toughened its rhetoric in its row with Washington, saying it was considering ways to retaliate for the seizure of some of its diplomatic premises in the United States and expulsions of diplomats.
""The situation is outrageous,"" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told Russian media during a visit to Austria on Tuesday.
""I believe that for such a great country like the United States of America, this advocate of international law, it's just shameful to leave the situation in mid-air,"" he said in comments posted on his ministry's website.
""We are now thinking of specific steps."" He declined to elaborate on what the retaliatory measures could include.
Citing a Russian diplomatic source, the Izvestia daily said Russia was considering expelling around 30 U.S. diplomats and taking over two U.S. diplomatic compounds in Moscow and St Petersburg.
In December, the U.S. seized two Russian diplomatic compounds and then-President Barack Obama ordered the expulsion of 35 Russians over what he said was their involvement in hacking to interfere in the U.S. presidential election campaign.
Moscow denied the allegations and said then it would wait to see if relations improved under incoming President Donald Trump.
Izvestia on Tuesday said the Russian government was frustrated that President Vladimir Putin's first meeting with Trump in Hamburg last week had failed to resolve the diplomatic row.
Their discussions far exceeded the original time limit, ranging from cyber security to the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine. Trump described the talks soon afterwards as ""very, very good"".
A senior U.S. administration official told Reuters on Tuesday he had been told the issue of the compounds did not come up during the Trump-Putin meeting. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Lavrov's remarks.
Lavrov said on Tuesday Russia well understood the impact of the continued ""anti-Russian bias of the U.S. Congress"" now that the Trump administration had long been in place.
""We realize that the decision to expel our diplomats, to impound our diplomatic property was adopted by the administration of former U.S. President Obama,"" he said.
The outgoing administration had aimed ""to poison to a maximum U.S.-Russian ties"" and create a ""trap"" for Trump, he added.
Trump and his aides have been dogged by allegations of collusion with Russian interference in last year's U.S. election.
Izvestia said Moscow still hoped the diplomatic row could be solved during a meeting between Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Shannon.
It did not say when such a meeting might happen. A previous such meeting between Ryabkov and Shannon, planned for June 23, was abruptly canceled by Moscow in response to the expansion of U.S. sanctions on Russia.

Jeff Sessions Gives Speech On United States Law Enforcement Getting Tougher On Crime!,"Jeff Sessions Speaks To National Law Enforcement Leaders In Minneapolis
On a swing through Minneapolis on Monday, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions previewed a tougher approach to violent crime and illegal immigration from the Trump administration while vowing not to make law enforcement’s job “more difficult than it already is.”
Sessions pointed to a six-year rise in violent crime in Minneapolis, citing local police, and a surge in gunfire reports compiled by St. Paul police.
“My best judgment is that this is not a blip; it’s not an aberration,” Sessions said. “Capitulating to this trend is not an option for America, [and] it’s not an option for us.”
Minneapolis police statistics do show a modest increase in some violent crimes, but overall show that Part I crimes — including homicide, rape and robbery — have fallen steadily and are down sharply from a decade ago.
Still, the attorney general painted a stark picture, where “violent crime seems to be rising again” nationwide with homicide rates up in 27 of the country’s 35 largest cities, including Minneapolis.
Below is the entirety of his speech.

Thank you, Michael for that introduction, and thank you for your hard work in San Bernardino.
I also want to thank Mike Freeman for hosting us today, and I want to congratulate you on being elected the next president of the NDAA. You’ve got big shoes to fill, Mike. I understand that we’ll be passing the gavel to you in just a few minutes. NDAA is indeed the ‘Voice of America’s Prosecutors.’
It is essential that you work together for common aims and work to improve your skills, understanding and performance. This conference’s focus on how to reduce violence and the exploitation of women is just the kind of professional training that is essential.
It is an honor to be with you, and to be with 250 prosecutors who have dedicated their lives to enforcing our laws and to keeping our communities safe.
I was a prosecutor for 14 years, and there is nothing I am more proud of than that. We were a small U.S. Attorney’s office in Mobile, but we felt we did a lot of good.
We took on corruption; we broke up national and international fraud schemes, and we took tons of drugs off our streets. I know that you all are having that same kind of impact and I thank you for that.
As a prosecutor, you have the honor of representing your community in court. I will never forget the feeling of going before a judge and saying, “the United States is ready.” I will never get over that feeling of knowing that I represented the greatest country in the history of the world. I’m sure you feel the same way.

Unfortunately, our jobs are becoming even more difficult.
We have a multi-front battle in front of us right now: an increase in violent crime, a rise in vicious gangs, an opioid epidemic, threats from terrorism, and human traffickers, combined with a culture in which family and discipline seems to be eroding further.
From the early 1990s until just a few years ago, the crime rate steadily came down across the country.
But violent crime is rising. The murder rate, for example, has surged nearly 11 percent nationwide in just one year — the largest increase since 1968. Per capita homicide rates are up in 27 of our 35 largest cities.
That includes right here in a great city like Minneapolis. According to Minneapolis police, violent crime has increased six years in a row. Through the first half of this year, the preliminary data shows that violent crime is up 17 percent and homicides are up over 40 percent from this time last year.
These numbers are deeply troubling—and especially since they represent a sharp reversal of decades of progress. My best judgment is that this rise is not an aberration or a blip. We must take these developments seriously and consider carefully what can be done about them.
Related: Oregon Passes Law Boosting Sanctuary State Profile By Prohibiting Disclosure Of Immigration Status – HB 3464
Yielding to the trend is not an option for America and certainly not to us.
As prosecutors, you know the people behind these stories all too well. Just last week, a man in the North Side of St. Paul was holding his infant daughter when he heard gunshots outside. One bullet went through his window and narrowly missed his 10-year old son. Reports of gunfire are up 62 percent in St. Paul through the first half of this year.
This past weekend in Chicago, there were 56 people shot. 56. In one, police say a community activist was fatally shot less than a block from the offices of his nonprofit that worked to fight violence in the neighborhood. These tragedies continue to pile up and we must put an end to it.
Let me state what you already understand: 85 percent of all law officers are state, local, and tribal. Likewise, there are many more district attorneys than federal prosecutors. While the Department of Justice and federal officers play a crucial public safety role, the backbone of the system is you and your partners.
President Trump understands this. He sent my Department three executive orders. One directs us to be supportive of local law enforcement. A second declared that our mission is to “reduce crime” in America. The third directed us to dismantle transnational criminal organizations. These are our goals and we are getting after them.
Real improvements in public safety can only come from partnerships. I believe that state, local, and federal relations are strong now, and I want to see them get better.
Helping you do your jobs, helping the police get better, and celebrating the noble, honorable, essential and challenging work you do will always be a top priority of mine.
We will aggressively prosecute federal or state officers who violate the civil rights of our citizens. But we will take care to never demean or offer unwarranted criticism of the honorable, brave, and professional law enforcement officers who protect us every day.
We must encourage proven police techniques like community-based, proactive policing and “broken windows”—policies that are lawful and proven to work.

Better training, better morale, professional excellence are goals of yours.
My goal is to help you be effective and never to make your work more difficult. I am asking our U.S. Attorneys to be leaders in this approach. In the long run, there is nothing we can do that is more impactful.
As a Ronald Reagan U.S. Attorney, there was no more important relationship for me than with my Democrat D.A. Chris Galanos was a great partner.
A simple, quick phone call could fix problems and allow us to make significant decisions. We trusted each other because we shared the same goals. I wish that kind of relationship for all of you. If there is a problem, you can call me personally. Stopping the rise in crime and reversing it, we all know, will not be easy but with unity and determination, smart policies, efficiencies and enthusiasm, we can do it. We will do it.
As District Attorneys, you know the important role of the Department of Justice and you are probably wondering what changes and priorities you will see from Washington and your U.S. Attorneys.
First, as I have stated, we want to build even closer partnerships with you in order to build a unified, tough, and effective focus on crime reduction. But there are other priorities and initiatives we will pursue.
I want to see a substantial increase in gun crime prosecutions. I believe, as we partner together and hammer criminals who carry firearms during crimes or criminals that possess firearms after being convicted of a felony, the effect will be to reduce violent crime.
Next, the DEA reports that 80 percent of heroin addicts started with abuse of prescription drugs.
As you know, more than 50,000 died of drug overdoses in 2015. Preliminary numbers indicate 2016 may hit 60,000. We have never seen numbers like this. This nation is prescribing and consuming far too many painkillers. This must end.
Last week, we announced the indictments of over 400 defendants as part of the annual Health Care Fraud Take Down. 120 of those involved opioid-related drug fraud and nearly 50 were doctors. Some of these frauds involved massive amounts of drugs.
But I’m convinced this is a winnable war. We can significantly reduce this abuse, which includes the big drug companies as well.
DEA is making these cases a priority. They can make visits to physician and pharmacies and do checks on those who prescribe or sell these drugs.
They are reviewing and identifying physician and pharmacy outliers that can help you narrow the search for crooks.
I would urge you to examine every case that involves an arrest of an individual illegally possessing prescription drugs. Make a condition of any plea bargain that the defendant tell where he or she got the drugs. Together, let’s get after these bad actors.
We are also placing greater emphasis on dismantling gangs—especially the most violent like MS-13.
We can never cede a single neighborhood or a block or a street corner to criminal gangs. Much of the nation’s rising murder rate is a result of violent gang activity. Minneapolis has seen an increase in murders just this year as I mentioned previously. Police officers recently noted that a “relatively small group of offenders” is responsible for the bloodshed and that “at least half of the city’s homicides were gang related.”
While criminal gangs have been growing and are numerous, their numbers are finite. If we target them aggressively, we can reduce homicides and make our communities safer.
In addition, we hope to issue this week a new directive on asset forfeiture—especially for drug traffickers. With care and professionalism, we plan to develop policies to increase forfeitures. No criminal should be allowed to keep the proceeds of their crime. Adoptive forfeitures are appropriate as is sharing with our partners.
I recently sent out my directive on charging and sentencing. It is sound law and policy. Assistant U.S. Attorneys will simply be expected to charge the most serious readily provable offense. If that would be unjust, prosecutors can seek a waiver approval from a designated supervisor without Washington.
In short, we have ended the policies that handcuffed our federal prosecutors.
Another key issue is to end the lawlessness in our immigration system. The people of this country have been pleading with their leaders for decades for a lawful system of immigration that serves our national interest and in which we can take pride.
Our goal is not to reduce illegal immigration but to end illegal immigration. We are already seeing positive results with illegal border crossings in March hitting the lowest monthly figure in 17 years.
In just 5 states over 3 days ICE arrested 86 nationals.
62 had criminal convictions and 23 had been previously deported. 7 were fugitives with outstanding final orders of removal. One U.S. Attorney in an average non border state, told me they had presented 300 illegal reentry cases last year.
Operation Streamline, the addition of 50 immigration judges, more AUSAs in key districts, more border patrol and ICE officers are already turning the tide and just beginning. With a major decline in illegal entry attempts, more personnel, and the wall, we have a real opportunity to fix this problem.
Your conference this week is focused on an important subject: combating violence against women. The Department of Justice stands with you, and we will support you in this mission.
Benjamin Hawk is an experienced DOJ attorney prosecuting human trafficking, complex sex trafficking, and hate crimes. We are proud that he is participating in this conference.
And we are proud of the work that our Office of Violence Against Women does. They provides grants to fund the hiring of more than 300 prosecutors around the country every year.
That investment has yielded results, too. For example, in Michigan, prosecutors funded through this grant have reopened cold cases and brought charges against several alleged serial rapists.
As prosecutors, we have a difficult job, but our efforts at the federal, state, and local levels have a real impact. With every conviction we secure, we make our communities safer.
Let me close by thanking all of you once again for choosing to do this noble work. Each of you is a bright light of hope and justice. Your light shines in the darkness, and the darkness will not overcome it.
Keep up the good work, have a productive training session, and thanks for having me here today.",C.S.C. Media Group U.S.,1
Walter Shaub’s Ethics Recommendations for the Government,"Continue reading the main storyShare This Page

Walter M. Shaub Jr., the Office of Government Ethics’s departing director.Credit T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times
The federal government’s ethics agency has rarely received much attention in Washington. That changed with the arrival of President Trump and an administration stocked with unusually wealthy appointees who have ties to industries they now help regulate. Suddenly, the usually sleepy Office of Government Ethics was clashing with the White House.
Walter M. Shaub Jr., the agency’s departing director, thinks those clashes have exposed weaknesses in ethics laws. Given that Republicans control both chambers of Congress, passing any of his proposals will be difficult, some more so than others. Here is what Mr. Shaub wants Congress to do.
• Establish that the director of the Office of Government Ethics may only be fired by the president for cause and with 30 days’ notice to Congress.
• Clarify that the agency has authority to oversee ethics compliance in all divisions of the Executive Office of the President, including the right to collect information like job descriptions, ethics agreements and waivers that exempt certain employees from ethical standards.
Continue reading the main story
Continue reading the main story
• Require the federal government’s 4,000 or so political appointees to prepare formal ethics agreements with their agencies that detail in writing what they cannot do without a conflict of interest, such as taking an action that might benefit a former employer or a company to which they have financial ties.
Continue reading the main story
• Require that these employees sign statements that they have taken the necessary steps to comply with the ethics agreements, and then publicly post those statements, along with the original ethics agreements, on a government website. Currently, only about 1,100 federal employees must negotiate ethics agreements and sign statements of compliance.
A Little More Difficult
• Grant the ethics office limited subpoena power to ensure that federal agencies and employees are honoring ethics requirements. Make it easier for the office to recommend discipline for employees who have violated rules. (Mr. Shaub is not asking for broad powers for the office to conduct investigations by interviewing witnesses or to formally punish violators.)
• Allow the agency to propose its budget and legislative changes directly to Congress, in addition to sending them to the Office of Management and Budget, through which such proposals must currently be cleared.

• Require that federal employees, including the president, disclose business liabilities and debts in entities that they control. Currently, they are only required to disclose debts for which they are personally responsible.
• Require that federal employees disclose assets that are placed in so-called discretionary trusts, investment vehicles that hold property they may benefit from but are not currently controlling.
A Much Harder Sell
• Require presidential and vice-presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns to the Federal Election Commission and file them with the Office of Government Ethics, as they must currently do with more limited financial information.
• Create a new conflict of interest standard that applies to the president and vice president. It would be more flexible than the one governing all other federal employees.
This standard would prevent the president from holding an interest in a privately held company or a controlling interest in a publicly held company that does business with the federal government. A limit might also be imposed on compensation to the president for the use of his or her name while in office.
Such a requirement would prompt a negotiation between the president and the ethics office similar to those currently conducted with the president’s appointees. Under the proposal, the ethics office would not have enforcement authority, and there would be no explicit penalty for violating the standard. But Congress could take action if the president did not comply.

"Leaked! Obama’s Ties Fully Exposed, CIA Official Reveals Barack Obama’s Plans To Destroy America And Proves President Trump 100% Right","Clare M. Lopez is persuaded Obama is attempting to bring down America as we probably are aware it. Previous CIA employee, Clare M. Lopez, was not only a pencil pusher with a work area work for our legislature. She was the Vice President for Research and Analysis at the Center for Security Policy and a Senior Fellow at The Clarion Project, the London Center for Policy Research, and the Canadian Meighen Institute.
That is a significant resume! So when you read what she stated, this can’t in any way, shape or form be originating from a position of wildness. It’s entirely genuine.
Via Yes I’m Right:
Since 2013, she has served as a member of the Citizens Commission on Benghazi. She was also a Vice-President of the Intelligence Summit, she was formerly a career officer with the Central Intelligence Agency, a professor at the Center for Counterintelligence and Security Studies, Executive Director of the Iran Policy Committee from 2005-2006, and served as a consultant , Intelligence analyst, and researcher for a variety of defense firms. She was named Lincoln Fellow at the Claremont Institute in 2011.
Lopez said the global war on terror was an effort to “stay free of Shariah,” or repressive Islamic law, until Obama’s administration began siding with such jihadist groups as the Muslim Brotherhood and its affiliates.
Lopez believes that the Muslim Brotherhood has thoroughly infiltrated the Obama administration and other branches of the federal government.
One of the most outrageous of those appointments is Mohamed Elibiary, a senior member of the Department of Homeland Security Advisory Council.
According to a report by the Center for Security Policy, Elibiary supports brokering a U.S. Partnership with the Muslim Brotherhood terrorist group. Two months ago, a firestorm erupted online after Elibiary tweeted that a ‘Caliphate’ was unavoidable and compared it to the European Union.
Clare broadly expounded, on video. It’s completely chilling:
That is all I expected to listen.
Here’s a later video in which she discusses digital fear mongering and why Trump is totally right:

Woman delays flight with 'lucky' coin-throw into engine,"Beijing (CNN)Bad weather, crowded skies and military drills...and now add coin-tossing to the growing list of reasons for China's notorious flight delays.
Police took away an 80-year-old woman Tuesday after fellow passengers reported that she was throwing coins at the plane during boarding of China Southern Airlines flight CZ380 on the tarmac of Shanghai's Pudong International Airport.
""The passenger, surnamed Qiu, who has no prior criminal record or mental health issues, claimed she tossed coins as a prayer for a safe flight,"" Shanghai Police said in a statement.
It added that officers found nine coins at the scene, including one that fell into the engine of the Airbus A320 aircraft, with others scattered on the ground nearby.
MORE: Biggest air threat? That could be you
Plane delayed more than five hours
The airline had to clear nearly 150 passengers from the full flight bound for Guangzhou, originally scheduled to depart at 12:40 p.m.
""To ensure flight safety, China Southern's aircraft maintenance staff conducted a thorough inspection of the engine, which concluded at 4:53 p.m., and cleared the aircraft for takeoff,"" the carrier said in a statement.
The flight eventually took off at 6:16 p.m. and arrived at its destination more than five hours late.
A police photo shows the total value of the coins adds up to 1.7 yuan (about 25 US cents), but local media estimated the cost of engine inspection and flight delay could easily run in the thousands of dollars.
Police said the case will be investigated further.
The story quickly went viral across China, the world's second-largest aviation market and home to some of its most delayed airports.
Shanghai Pudong, which served more than 66 million passengers last year, is often at the bottom of airport on-time performance rankings.
Given frequent complaints about the lack of information on the delays, at least for once everyone knows who to blame.

McCain recovers from surgery as health care vote remains on hold,"McCain recovers from surgery as vote on health care bill remains on hold
WASHINGTON -- A vote on the Senate health care bill is on hold while Republican Senator John McCain recovers from surgery.
His vote is needed to get the bill through -- and even that might not be enough.
Meanwhile, the 80-year-old politician had well wishes from his colleagues.
""Our friend from Arizona is a pretty tough guy as we all know,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said.
Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, speaks during a press conference on Feb. 5, 2015, in Washington, D.C.
That tough guy was recuperating at his home in Phoenix on Monday where sources say McCain was well enough to take calls from staffers and fellow senators including South Carolina's Lindsey Graham.
CBS News asked Graham how McCain's recent health setback was discovered.
""Routine check,"" Graham said. ""He [McCain] goes back every so often, but he had not been feeling good. He was really tired ... he flies all over the world all the time and I was getting really worried about him.""
On Friday, McCain's surgeons performed a ""minimally invasive craniotomy"" -- an incision through the skull -- to remove a ""5-cm blood clot"" above his left eye, according to a statement from McCain's office. This was not far from the spot on his left temple where he had a cancerous lesion removed in 2000.
More hurdles as Senate delays vote on GOP health bill
Senator John McCain underwent emergency surgery on Friday to remove a blood clot from above his eye. This has forced Republican leaders to call o...
""I was in a battle with melanoma,"" McCain said at the time. ""And I know, and I know somewhat, at least to a small degree, how tough that battle can be.""
Sen. Graham had noted that the normally sharp six-term senator had become forgetful lately.
Most notably, McCain faltered publicly while grilling former FBI head James Comey last month in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
CBS chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook weighed in on the surgery.
""The front of the brain is important for social interaction, communications,"" Dr. LaPook pointed out. ""So any abnormality there could cause a change in behavior.""
McCain's health crisis is holding up a vote that could affect health care for millions of Americans.
Health care reform and controversies give Trump headaches
Between the controversy surrounding his son's meeting with a Russian lawyer for dirt on Hillary Clinton and another setback for health care refor...
So President Trump wished McCain a speedy recovery on Monday.
""We miss him. He's a crusty voice in Washington. Plus, we need his vote,"" Mr. Trump said to a crowd.
McCain is one of about a dozen Republicans who haven't said where they stand. He's gotten an earful from Arizona's Republican governor who is worried about the bill's deep Medicaid cuts. Supporters say dragging this process out will only amplify that kind of opposition.

"Kejriwal releases Rs 30,000 subsidy each for 6,000 e-rickshaw owners","The Chief Minister handed over intimation letters regarding release of subsidy to 26 e-Rickshaw owners including two women. (PTI)
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday released the subsidy of Rs 30,000 each to 6,000 e-rickshaw owners registered with the government. Addressing the event at Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium, he said that pollution was among the biggest problems faced by the residents of Delhi and e-rickshaws provide a solution to air pollution and last mile connectivity. The Chief Minister handed over intimation letters regarding the release of subsidy to 26 e-Rickshaw owners including two women.
On Saturday, about 6,000 e-rickshaw owners, whose particulars have been verified by Transport Department, were granted the subsidy of around Rs 15 crores. It was announced in the programme that subsidy amount is being directly transferred in their bank accounts.
The Delhi government had earlier announced a subsidy of Rs 15,000 in 2015 to owners of newly-purchased battery-operated e-rickshaws authorised and registered by the Transport Department. This subsidy amount was later enhanced to Rs 30,000 for the e-rickshaws purchased with effect from April 1, 2016.
As per the Scheme, an individual can claim subsidy only on one e-rickshaw. No subsidy is permitted on subsequent purchase by the same individual. The subsidy is given by Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) from the Air Ambience Fund.
Kejriwal also announced that all those e-rickshaw owners who submit necessary documents i.e. permanent driving license, bank account details and canceled cheque by July 22 with the respective MLOs will see their subsidy being credited in their bank account by July 31.
“Those who cannot approach MLOs till July 22, may submit the requisite documents with their area MLAs as well,” he said.",Financial Express,0
"5 Takeaways From the ‘Very Robust,’ 2-Hour Meeting Between Trump and Putin","Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump finally had their first, and much-awaited, face-to-face meeting as world leaders on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Hamburg on Friday.
It was hard for Americans to suss out just what had happened in the meeting, which lasted much, much longer than expected. Unlike his Russian counterpart, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson did not hold an on-camera briefing after the meeting’s conclusion, ceding to Moscow the narrative about what happened behind closed doors.
Tillerson said the meeting was “very robust,” “very constructive,” and featured that most important element of diplomacy, “clear positive chemistry.”
Flying sparks and fawning eyes aside, here are five big takeaways from the Trump-Putin summit.
We’re no closer to getting a straight answer from Trump as to what role, exactly, he thinks Russia played in the 2016 presidential election.
By all accounts, Russia’s meddling in the U.S. election came up in the meeting. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, with decades of diplomatic experience, said Trump accepted Putin’s explanation that Russia did not hack America’s 2016 presidential elections. Lavrov also said, “Trump mentioned that in the U.S. certain circles still inflate subject of Russian meddling in elections, even though they have no proof.”
Tillerson said that Trump raised the issue with Putin, who denied a Russian role, and that the two see no point in relitigating the past.
“The two leaders agreed, though, that this is a substantial hindrance in the ability of us to move the Russian-U.S. relationship forward, and agreed to exchange further work regarding commitments of non-interference in the affairs of the United States and our democratic process as well as those of other countries.”
Anonymous administration officials, who the White House says cannot be trusted, later told CNN that Trump did not accept Putin’s claims.
But Russia and the United States have agreed to work together on cybersecurity.
The two sides agreed not to (further?) interfere in one another’s affairs and cooperate on keeping their cyber strong. Or, to use Tillerson’s parlance, they “agreed to explore creating a framework around which the two countries can work together to better understand how to deal with these cyber threats, both in terms of how these tools are used to in interfere with the internal affairs of countries, but also how these tools are used to threaten infrastructure, how these tools are used from a terrorism standpoint as well.”
Putin and Trump bonded over their hostility toward a free press.
""These are the ones who insulted you?"" Putin to Trump as he points to reporters https://t.co/vxx8qcDkRp
— Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) July 7, 2017
Another cease-fire was brokered in Syria.
However, there are still “details” to be worked out as to who will enforce it. Also, Israel hates the idea. And Tillerson acknowledged that previous cease-fires have failed quickly.
The two countries have more in common than separating them.
This, according to Tillerson. “I would tell you that, by and large, our objectives are exactly the same.” (That stuck in the throat of U.S. foreign-policy experts.)
Those areas of common ground do not, however, include Ukraine, North Korea’s nuclear program, or the U.S. deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system to South Korea, which Russia has said should stop, and which apparently did not come up in the two-hour-and-15-minute meeting.",Foreign Policy,0

BREAKING: James Comey Heading To Prison? Here’s What We Know,"Dean James III% AMERICA’S FREEDOM FIGHTERS –
More than half of the memos created by former FBI Director James Comey of his private conversations with President Trump have been found to contain classified information, according to a new report.
The Hill, quoting “officials familiar with the documents,” reported overnight that Comey penned a total of seven memos describing his talks with Trump on the Russia case earlier this year – and four of them had markings indicating they contained classified material at the “secret” or “confidential” level.
President Trump on Monday accused former FBI Director James Comey of having illegally leaked classified material, on the heels of the report.
According to the report, the memos recently were shown to Congress — and the FBI claimed they were all government documents, despite Comey’s description of his notes as personal.
Trump seized on the news Monday morning.
“James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media. That is so illegal!” the president tweeted.
James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media. That is so illegal!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2017
The claims in The Hill regarding Comey’s memos are a throwback to the same kind of allegations against former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, whom Comey’s team investigated for mishandling classified material on her private server and email.
More on the memos from the Daily Caller:
Comey has said that he memorialized his personal meetings and phone conversations with Trump because he felt uneasy about the circumstances of their encounters. Their first one-on-one meeting was a private dinner at the White House on Jan. 27. The pair also talked privately in the Oval Office on Feb. 14.
In that meeting, Comey says Trump asked him to close the FBI’s investigation of Michael Flynn, who Trump had fired as national security adviser the day before.
The existence of the memos was not revealed until after Trump fired Comey on May 9. In his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee last month, he maintained that he believed that the information in the memos was unclassified. He also said that he leaked at least one of the documents to a Columbia law professor friend of his.
“My thinking was if I write it in such a way that I don’t include anything that would trigger a classification, that would make it easier to discuss within the FBI and the government and to hold onto it in a way that makes it accessible to us,” Comey testified.
Also in his testimony, Comey said that he did not turn over the memos after being fired because he viewed them as personal documents. But according to The Hill, the FBI considers the memos to be government records.
More on the memos from Breitbart:
“This revelation raises the possibility that Comey broke his own agency’s rules and ignored the same security protocol that he publicly criticized Hillary Clinton for in the waning days of the 2016 presidential election,” it added.
Comey had called Clinton “extremely careless” for creating a private email server that stored classified information but did not recommend prosecution because he said there was no evidence of criminal intent.
According to the report, congressional investigators have already begun examining whether Comey’s creation, storage, and sharing of the memos violated FBI policy.
“Now, congressional investigators are likely to turn their attention to the same issues to determine if Comey mishandled any classified information in his personal memos,” it said.
The report noted that the memos were shown to Congress in recent days.
The report also said the FBI considers all of the memos to be “government documents,” contrary to Comey’s claim they were “personal documents.”
“FBI policy forbids any agent from releasing classified information or any information from ongoing investigations or sensitive operations without prior written permission, and mandates that all records created during official duties are considered to be government property,” the report said
Comey admitted to senators last month that he leaked at least one memo to his friend Daniel Richman, a Columbia Law School professor and former prosecutor so that he could leak them to the New York Times.
The memo he was referring to documented a conversation where Trump allegedly asked Comey to drop his investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.
He argued he did so as a “private citizen” and that these were his “personal documents.”
Article continues below the poll.
While Comey had the authority to classify and de-classify information as he saw fit when he was the FBI’s director, he retained possession of them after leaving his position, which is a big no-no because they’re government property. Also, his friend who had the documents in their possession could be in trouble for possessing classified information, although it remains to be seen what, if any, punishment there’s going to be for either man.

'Postcode lottery' affects firefighters' response to tower block blazes,"Union asks Theresa May for urgent review of firefighters’ resources, following ‘hindered’ response to Grenfell Tower blaze
Firefighters spray water at Grenfell Tower in west London on 14 June.
 
Union asks Theresa May for urgent review of firefighters’ resources, following ‘hindered’ response to Grenfell Tower blaze
Saturday 15 July 2017 10.06 EDTLast modified on Saturday 15 July 2017 10.40 EDT
Firefighters’ capability to tackle devastating blazes such as the Grenfell Tower fire vary widely depending on where they are based in the UK, a union has said.
The different standards in how fire services can respond to life-threatening tower block fires is a “postcode lottery”, the Fire Brigades Union has said.
Differing levels of resources around the country mean that the numbers of fire engines that should automatically be sent to a fire varies greatly according to its location, according to FBU research.
Lack of equipment 'hampered Grenfell rescue effort'
There are 125 aerial ladder/platform vehicles – with long ladders or platforms to reach fires in high buildings – in England, but only 33 of them are available around the clock because of a lack of fire crews, according to the figures.
Matt Wrack, the FBU general secretary and a former firefighter, described the findings as “extremely concerning” in light of the Grenfell Tower fire, and called tje situation “utterly unacceptable”.
He said: “We find it staggering that nothing has been done to address this grossly unjust postcode lottery of resources, and the fact that governments in all parts of the UK appear not to have even considered it is a disgrace.
“They now need to urgently instruct fire services to improve their fire-and-rescue planning, to ensure a full and professional response to such incidents all over the UK. Citizens everywhere need to feel safe and confident that those in authority are taking their safety seriously. Anything less is, frankly, obscene.”
Kent, Humberside and Nottinghamshire have just three fire engines and no aerial platforms ready for automatic dispatch, while Hampshire has eight fire engines and an aerial vehicle.
The FBU, which represents the majority of UK firefighters, also states that the size of a fire crew can also vary between four or five firefighters per fire engine.
Wrack has written to the prime minster, Theresa May, asking for an urgent review of firefighters’ resources. He wrote: “In the aftermath of the terrible tragedy at Grenfell Tower, we are aware that there are greatly differing standards and approaches adopted by different fire-and-rescue services across the country.
“We had hoped that one immediate response from central government would be to implement or establish an urgent review to ensure that the appropriate resources are available to firefighters attending such incidents in the future ... this appears not to have been done, which causes us concern and alarm.”
Some of the firefighters who attended the Grenfell Tower blaze said their response to the disaster was hindered by a lack of suitable equipment, low water pressure and radio problems.
Some of those present told a BBC Newsnight investigation that they had struggled to get through on their radios with vital messages because of an overuse of the system, as well as the difficulty of getting a signal through several floors of concrete.
According to the programme, a 30-metre-high aerial ladder did not arrive at the scene until more than half an hour after the first fire engines were dispatched.
Two-hundred firefighters responded using 40 engines and a range of specialist vehicles to the fire in west London that killed at least 80 people.",The Guardian – Politics,0
Anthony Scaramucci won't commit to resuming 'regular' on-camera press briefings,"| Jul 21, 2017, 2:51 PMShare on TwitterShare on FacebookEmail this articleShare on LinkedIn

Incoming White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci wouldn't commit on Friday to resuming ""regular"" on-camera press briefings.
Scaramucci said he would want to speak with President Trump about the format of press briefings, but allowed that ""we may"" install more on-camera appearances for the new press secretary, Sarah Sanders.
""The answer is we may,"" he said after being asked about more on-camera briefings. ""I have to talk to the president about that. I like consulting with the president before I make decisions like that.""
Sanders, currently the White House deputy press secretary, was promoted on Friday following the resignation that same day of Sean Spicer. Spicer said he would stay on through August.
The White House communications wing has drawn scrutiny, mostly from reporters, for dialing back the frequency of on-camera briefings, opting instead of audio-only briefings.
Scaramucci has no experience in government and said he would take the first ""couple weeks"" in his new role learning about his staff and said he has ""empathy for journalists"" and is hoping to ""de-escalate"" White House relations with the media.

Video: NYPD Shows Exactly What They Think Their Activist Mayor … And We Love It,"Published on July 13, 2017
 
They showed deBlasio the contempt he so richly deserves.
Did the mayor really think he could jet off to the G20 to protest the President (on the taxpayer dime) while the city was mourning the coldblooded murder of a veteran cop and mother of three?
His political hatred of the President obviously ‘trumps’ his dedication and service to his constituents. (And he stuck them with the bill for it, too.)
HUNDREDS turned their backs on deBlasio during his address at the funeral of Miosotis Familia.
“The mayor is the compass for the city of New York,” Lynch told the Daily News before Familia’s funeral. “And unfortunately, when a police officer got killed, his compass led him to Germany rather than here on the Concourse. He should have been here with the family … He should have been there with us.”
NYPD cops made a similar symbolic gesture in 2014, turning their back on de Blasio as tensions mounted between police and the mayor over the death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, at the hands of police, as well as the assassination of two NYPD officers, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, by a gunman. — Read More
They snubbed him because they felt snubbed themselves.

The protest came after de Blasio skipped town to participate in protests at the G-20 summit in Germany last week — the day after Familia was killed by cop-hating gunman Alexander Bonds.
And as he prepared for the trip, the mayor missed a swearing-in ceremony for new police recruits, an event that was especially poignant in light of Familia’s murder.
Sergeants Benevolent Association President Ed Mullins said de Blasio deserved the snub.
“Mr. Mayor, you didn’t have to travel to Germany for a protest — all you had to do is speak in front of the men and women of the NYPD,’’ Mullins said.
Protesting officers chatted with one another and swiped through their phones while their backs were turned.
Many turned back around when Police Commissioner James O’Neill stepped up to speak — but not everyone paid respectful attention even then. Read More

But the plot continues to thicken as the day goes on. As it turns out, the Russia lawyer Donald Jr. met with isn’t just anybody. In fact, he may have ties to Fusion GPS, the firm behind the Trump dossier.
Just days after meeting with Trump Jr., Natalia Veselnitskaya showed up at the House of Representatives hearing on U.S. Policy Toward Putin’s Russia. She was actually any invited guest of the Obama administration and was photographed behind Obama’s former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul.
A deeper dive into Veselnitskaya’s Facebook page reveals that she actually appears to be pretty anti-Trump. Though she does, admittedly, criticize Trump protesters as well.

Democrats Don’t Need a ‘Better Deal.’ They Need an Intervention,"July 24, 2017Matt Terzi Politics
The ‘Better Deal?’ Kamala Harris? Okay, Democrats… It’s Time For An Intervention
I’m going to put a pot of coffee on. We’ll lay out a nice little spread of pastries and fruits. All you need to do is show up, America. We need to have an intervention for the Democratic Party. I know it will hurt you to write your speeches almost as much as it will hurt the Democrats to hear them, but we need to explain to them how their addiction to losing is hurting America. Because their “Better Deal?” Their anointment of Kamala Harris? It’s getting to be too much. We can’t let them self-destruct like this.
We all have reasons to be upset with the Democratic Party these days. Some of you want to hate them. Others are in denial and refuse to acknowledge that the Democratic Party has a problem to begin with. But they most certainly do have a problem, and sugar-coating things serves no one. They need help. Their addiction to losing doesn’t just hurt them. It hurts all of us who care about them. And if we don’t do something about this right now, we might lose the party forever.
Hillary Clinton’s Loss In 2016 Should’ve Taught the Democrats a Valuable Lesson
I could easily write a whole book on why Hillary Clinton lost in 2016, but it can all be summed up pretty succinctly in four words: Americans don’t trust her. And that has nothing to do with Bernie Sanders, or Russian hacking, or third-party candidates, or Benghazi, or her emails, or anything else you’d likely guess.
The real reason people don’t trust Hillary Clinton is the same reason the Democrats continuously manage to fuck themselves out of every midterm election. She lacks authenticity. And that’s the number-one quality someone running for office should be fighting like Hell to establish.
Hillary Clinton is a political Terminator robot built by the Democratic Party to become President. She’s designed to be overqualified for the Oval Office. A no-nonsense centrist built from the ground up to appeal to all of their target demographics. She flawlessly runs the “pick up baby, kiss baby, set baby down, smile” subroutines without a single bug. And she’s easily 400 percent more human-like than the Democrats’ earlier cyborg president model, the T-2004 John Kerry.
But there’s one thing robots suck at doing, and that’s faking human emotion. No one really knows where Hillary Clinton stands on any single issue, because her views are an amalgamation of polling data and focus-group testing. She’s a humorless political machine whose creepy, mechanized emulation of “human laughter” scares the ever-loving shit out of most people.
And that’s why even today, so many months into the Trump presidency, Clinton is still viewed unfavorably by a majority of Americans. A recent Bloomberg poll shows she’s even less popular today than Donald Trump. It’s impossible to really like or trust a candidate when you can’t really be sure where they truly stand on any issue. You can’t convince someone of such things without authenticity. And that’s the same exact problem the Democratic Party as a whole is suffering from today.
The Anointment of Kamala Harris for 2020: Did The Democratic Party Learn Nothing From 2016?
Progressive Democrats distrusted and disliked Clinton as much as anyone else. But regardless, the party added insult to injury by anointing Clinton as their “Chosen One” before the 2016 Democratic Primary had really begun. The party’s establishment determined Clinton would win, public opinion be damned, and those progressives who supported Bernie Sanders or anyone else? They were classified as enemies of the party and driven away by moderate Democrats who felt the party didn’t need or even want them.
It should come as no surprise then that progressives aren’t too happy with the anointment of freshman California Senator Kamala Harris for the 2020 race. A sect of Clinton’s former 2016 donors and staffers have donned her as their candidate of choice to run in the next election, and on paper, it’s easy to see why party-first Democrats are keen on her. Like Clinton, Harris is a staunch moderate. And like Barack Obama, Harris is experienced enough to do a good job, but not so overly experienced that people will see her as a career politician. She seems like a perfectly logical choice… right?
But a small room of party elites shouldn’t get to decide the winner of the party’s 2020 primary. After all, this is supposed to be an election, not a coronation.
Harris doesn’t have much to offer progressive voters. She’s pro-choice, a proponent of gun control, and she’s opposed to the death penalty. But those are all positions democrats generally favor, be they progressive or liberal or neoliberal. She seems to favor single-payer health care, but not in the firebrand manner progressives are accustomed to. Even there, her commitment level is best classified as mild. If the party’s leadership were to insist she back off single-payer, it’s probably safe to assume that’s precisely what she’d do. And that’s the problem with Kamala Harris. She doesn’t really seem committed to any issues on a personal level. Well, apart from her viewing the parents of truant school kids as criminals, that is.
The anointment of Kamala Harris shows that Democrats still don’t really know what they stand for, apart from trying to win elections. Choosing a moderate candidate with over-simplified positions that loosely cater to the center-left can hardly be classified as a bold political statement. And bold statements are precisely what Democrats should be looking to make right now.
The ‘Better Deal?’ Better For Whom?
And then comes this week’s grave insult to the progressive base: an obvious attempt at pandering to progressive voters that is already failing harder than Donald Trump’s autocorrect feature on his phone: the Democratic Party’s so-called “Better Deal.” A nauseating, cringe-worthy title they’ve slapped onto a new policy agenda that should be more aptly titled “Let’s Pander to Progressives And Hope They Don’t Notice.”
The name is obviously intended to be an homage to Teddy Roosevelt’s Square Deal and FDR’s New Deal. Teddy Roosevelt and FDR are both heroes of the contemporary progressive movement, so surely, the Democratic Party intends to win over progressives with some serious reform proposals, right? Medicare for all, environmentalism, universal college tuition, a pro-union expansion of labor laws, and some good ole’ fashioned Roosevelt-style trust-busting?
The Democrats’ “Better Deal” is meant to emulate the appearance of progressive ideals, but certainly has very little substance. And it’s broken down into three points that fall dismally short of winning over progressives or, more importantly, actually doing anything that helps the country.
With their Better Deal, Democrats are promising to create jobs with infrastructure, fight monopolization, and tackle prescription drug costs. But all of these proposals are absolutely toothless, and quite frankly insulting to progressive voters who are demanding real legislation on these fronts.
They’re promising infrastructure and the jobs that come with it, but that’s something everyone promises. We never really see anything come of big infrastructure promises, and until we see shovels hitting dirt, it’s pointless to get excited about them. They’re attempting to channel their inner-Roosevelt with a vow to bust up monopolies, but they make no mention of going after the big banks or the financial institutions that need trust-busting and fresh regulations like a fish needs water. And they talk about lowering prescription drug costs, but still get chilly whenever progressives talk about adopting true single-payer healthcare.
So what is this new agenda? It’s a bunch of moderate, middle-of-the-road, substance-free nonsense. They aren’t establishing positions or firmly planting themselves on these issues. It’s more noncommittal hogwash from a party that has perfected noncommittal hogwash in the past twenty or thirty years.
The Democratic Party Isn’t Getting This, And There Aren’t Many More Ways For Us To Explain It To Them
To their credit, the Democrats seem to acknowledge that they’re doing things wrong. But like a child attempting to glue together a vase they’ve just accidentally knocked over and smashed, Democrats are trying to fix what’s broken in all the wrong ways. They need help from a grown-up. Lots of help. Because right now, they’re just cutting their fingers when they aren’t gluing them together.
The Democratic Party isn’t going to win back progressives with begrudgingly weak-titled policy agendas or slightly-more-progressive-than-Hillary-was presidential candidates like Kamala Harris. And they’re not going to take back the White House by cautiously playing to the center and pretending that they’re more liberal than they actually are.
The Democratic Party lacks conviction. They’re not willing to fight for something unless it costs them nothing to do so. But that path of least resistance bullshit isn’t what American voters want to see from them. They want to see a party willing to fight for what they believe in, even if they don’t necessarily agree with them on every issue. Democrats aren’t doing that. They don’t seem to even really know what it is they’re fighting for. All they do know is that they really want to win.
The only way we’ll save the Democratic Party from itself is with this intervention. We need to sit them down and lovingly explain to them how their addiction to losing is hurting all of us. It’s time for the Democrats to commit to progressive values. That, or commit to the middle and quietly fade away as a third party rises from their ashes. But either way, it’s time for something to happen. And this intervention? It’s as good a place to start as any.
So please, write to your Democratic Party representatives. Author your letter the same way you would an intervention letter, outlining how their actions (and their inaction) hurt you, and send it out to them. Maybe if enough of us try to reach out, we can salvage the party before it’s too late.

Senate votes down controversial amendment to repeal and replace Obamacare,"| Jul 25, 2017, 9:39 PM | Updated Jul 25, 2017, 10:00 PMShare on TwitterShare on FacebookEmail this articleShare on LinkedIn
The Better Care Reconciliation included the Cruz amendment and a Medicaid wraparound. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)
A motion on a healthcare amendment that would have repealed and replaced portions of Obamacare failed Tuesday in the Senate.
The motion was on the Better Care Reconciliation Act amendment, and was shot down after 57 senators voted against a procedural move regarding whether it complies with the Budget Act. Had they voted differently, the amendment would only have required 50 votes for passage, but the latest move effectively kills the amendment.
In coming days the Senate is debating and voting on other amendments for a healthcare bill advanced by Republicans. Because they are using a measure known as reconciliation, most amendments will require only 50 votes for passage. This particular amendment, however, needs the traditional 60 votes because portions of it have not been scored by the Congressional Budget Office.
The bill was expected to fail because several Republicans have come out publicly against it, and because it did not have any Democratic support. Republicans hold only two additional seats in the Senate, making a 60-vote goal unlikely.
The amendment is the first of dozens that the Senate will be voting on in coming days, and the second that was introduced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
The Better Care Reconciliation Act is the bill Republicans have been debating among themselves for several months and includes an amendment by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, known as the ""Consumer Freedom Amendment."" It would allow insurers to offer cheaper plans that cover a smaller range of benefits as long as they offer one plan that has the essential health benefits included under Obamacare. The provision has been controversial among Republicans who say that it would make coverage for people with pre-existing illnesses prohibitively expensive.
""Americans know this as a 'fake insurance amendment,'"" said Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., while claiming on the Senate floor that the amendment would make policies worthless.
Cruz countered on the Senate floor that ""scaremongering"" was occurring and took issue with people having to purchase unsubsidized plans with a wide-range of medical benefits under Obamacare that they cannot afford.
A second provision contained in the amendment, which also required 60 votes, was called the Medicaid wraparound. Backed by Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, the amendment provided $200 billion to the Medicaid program and was aimed at addressing the concerns of other senators who were on the fence but ultimately voted to support the motion to proceed, such as GOP Sens. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Dean Heller of Nevada. All had said that they would debate the bill but wanted to ensure that people on Medicaid would be protected.
Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told reporters earlier on Tuesday that another option to still include the provisions would be to send the bill to conference with the House, which would buy more time for a CBO score on both amendments.
Still, a final hurdle would remain: The Senate parliamentarian has not made a determination on whether the provisions meet reconciliation rules, which require that the bill target only items that have to do with the federal budget. Several other provisions that Republicans have discussed and will consider in coming days also would not pass this test, including anti-abortion provisions, a measure to charge seniors higher premiums, and a provision that would let small businesses bypass Obamacare insurance rules.

"Exclusive: Overruling diplomats, U.S. to drop Iraq, Myanmar from child soldiers' list","U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks during a press conference after talks with Chinese diplomatic and defense chiefs at the State Department in Washington, U.S. June 21, 2017.
WASHINGTON In a highly unusual intervention, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson plans to remove Iraq and Myanmar from a U.S. list of the world's worst offenders in the use of child soldiers, disregarding the recommendations of State Department experts and senior U.S. diplomats, U.S. officials said.
The decision, confirmed by three U.S. officials, would break with longstanding protocol at the State Department over how to identify offending countries and could prompt accusations the Trump administration is prioritizing security and diplomatic interests ahead of human rights.
Tillerson overruled his own staff’s assessments on the use of child soldiers in both countries and rejected the recommendation of senior diplomats in Asia and the Middle East who wanted to keep Iraq and Myanmar on the list, said the officials, who have knowledge of the internal deliberations.
Tillerson also rejected an internal State Department proposal to add Afghanistan to the list, the three U.S. officials said.
One official said the decisions appeared to have been made following pressure from the Pentagon to avoid complicating assistance to the Iraqi and Afghan militaries, close U.S. allies in the fight against Islamist militants. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
Foreign militaries on the list can face sanctions including a prohibition on receiving U.S. military aid, training and U.S.-made weapons unless the White House issues a waiver.
Human rights officials expressed surprise at the delisting, which was expected to be announced on Tuesday, the officials said, as part of the State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report.
A State Department official said the TIP report's contents were being kept under wraps until its release and the department ""does not discuss details of internal deliberations.""
The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Under the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008, the U.S. government must be satisfied that ""no children are recruited, conscripted or otherwise compelled to serve as child soldiers"" in order for a country to be removed from the list and U.S. military assistance to resume.
In the lead-up to Tuesday's report, the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, which researches the issue and helps shape U.S. policy on it, along with its legal office and diplomatic bureaus in Asia and the Middle East concluded that the evidence merited keeping both countries on the list, the officials said.
Officials said that although the report had been finalized there was always the possibility of last-minute changes.
Human Rights Watch said removing Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, from the list would be a ""completely premature and disastrous action that will effectively betray more children to continued servitude and rights abuses.""
The decision also would put the Trump administration at odds with the United Nations, which continues to list the Myanmar military, along with seven ethnic armed groups, on its list of entities using and recruiting child soldiers.
""What's particularly astonishing is this move ignores that the U.N. in Burma says that it is still receiving new cases of children being recruited"" by the Myanmar military, said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch.
Rights groups have long accused Myanmar of using child soldiers. Bordering both China and India, Myanmar is also of growing strategic importance to the United States at a time of increasing encroachment in the region by China, which has sought closer relations with its neighbor.
Iraq, which has received more than $2 billion in U.S. arms and training over the last three years, was added to the State Department’s ""Child Soldier Prevention Act List"" in 2016. However, the flow of U.S. assistance has continued.
Former President Barack Obama handed out full or partial waivers regularly, including last year to Iraq, Myanmar, Nigeria, South Sudan and others out of 10 countries on the list.
Last year's State Department report said some militias of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), an umbrella group of mostly Shi'ite Muslim factions with ties to the Iraqi government and backed by Iran, ""recruited and used child soldiers.""
The report said that despite the PMF being funded by the government, Baghdad struggled to control all of its factions.
""The government did not hold anyone accountable for child recruitment and use by the PMF and PMF-affiliated militias.""
Human Rights Watch said in January that it had learned that militias had been recruiting child soldiers from one Iraqi refugee camp since last spring.
The broader TIP report, the first of Trump's presidency, is sure to be closely scrutinized for further signs that under his ""America First"" approach there will be little pressure brought to bear on friendly governments, especially strategically important ones, for human rights violations at home.
The Obama administration, while more vocal about political repression around the world, also faced criticism from human rights groups and some U.S. lawmakers that decisions on annual human trafficking rankings had become increasingly politicized.

Is the Trump admin threatening Alaska...,"A view of Denali, formerly known as Mt. McKinley, on Sept. 1, 2015 in Denali National Park, Alaska.

Is the Trump admin threatening Alaska over health care politics?
Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) has been one of the more consistent skeptics of her party’s health care crusade, and Donald Trump has made no secret of his frustrations with her principles. The question, however, is just how far the president is prepared to go in expressing his dissatisfaction.
The Alaska Dispatch News, the state’s largest newspaper, published a striking report overnight on the Trump administration’s Interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, reportedly calling both of Alaska’s Republican senators yesterday, alerting them to the fact that Murkowski’s position on health care “had put Alaska’s future with the administration in jeopardy.”
Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan said the call from Zinke heralded a “troubling message.”
“I’m not going to go into the details, but I fear that the strong economic growth, pro-energy, pro-mining, pro-jobs and personnel from Alaska who are part of those policies are going to stop,” Sullivan said.
“I tried to push back on behalf of all Alaskans…. We’re facing some difficult times and there’s a lot of enthusiasm for the policies that Secretary Zinke and the president have been talking about with regard to our economy. But the message was pretty clear,” Sullivan said. The Interior secretary also contacted Murkowski, he said.
Note, we’re not talking about an anonymous source raising serious allegations. This is a sitting Republican senator, describing a conversation he had yesterday with a Republican cabinet secretary in a Republican administration. And according to Dan Sullivan’s account, Trump’s Interior secretary was “pretty clear” that the White House is prepared to play a dangerous game of hardball with Alaska’s future.
It’s a nice state you have there; it’d be a shame if something bad happened to it.
In effect, the Alaska Dispatch News has described a scenario in which Trump wants Murkowski to punish Alaskans (by voting for a radical health care plan) or he’ll punish Alaskans (by using the Department of the Interior).
Let’s note for context that Alaska, which has backed the Republican ticket in every election for more than four decades, easily elected Trump last year. The president, in other words, is threatening to penalize some of his own supporters.
I realize this isn’t Trump’s style, but as we discussed yesterday, the president could take this opportunity to reach out to Murkowski, negotiate with her on the substance of health care, and perhaps even try to defend his health care ideas on the merits.
But since he doesn’t know how to do this, Trump’s apparently settled on trying to pass a regressive health care bill through extortion. Unable to lead, the president finds it easier to be a bully.

"He’s On Chopping Block? He Deliberately Sabotaged President Trump, Now It Is Over For Him?!","The deep state is a decade in length system of Democrats doing their best to prevent anything positive from occurring in Washington, DC. Since President Trump gone into the office, their new objective is to stop Trump no matter what. In any case, have their strategies gone too far?
Uncommon Counsel Robert Mueller, who has been delegated by Rod Rosenstein to explore the cases of collusion between the Trump organization and the Russians, is on a tear at the present time, employing each Liberal lawyer he can. He has the pleasure of being BFF to James Comey, previous FBI Director who was broadly terminated by President Trump. Another forecast is out there that says that the Special Counsel Mueller is so harsh to the organization, that he won’t make it 100 days from now, that Trump will be asking for his terminating before he can get to the meat of the investigation.
Via The Gateway Pundit:
Legal News site, LawNewz wrote a piece Friday morning predicting a special advisor Mueller will not make it another 100 days.
“Lets be clear, it was extraordinary for the President to fire the FBI director. In fact, James Comey was the only second ever to be fired in the United States. History. The President, however, had the authority to do it, but despite coming under fire during 2016 elections, Comey was long viewed as a fixture, sometimes controversial but even-handed, non-partisan and eminently qualified director who never would have been fired. Especially because of the ongoing Russia investigation. Except that is exactly what happened, and why it happened. The President admitted as much.
Since then the “witch hunt” investigation into the Trump campaign and alleged collusion with the Kremlin has taken a definitely more dangerous and personal turn for the President. And that’s why we think it will not be longer than 100 days before Trump pulls the trigger and “Comey” Mueller (he can not technically fire it, but he can certainly order it and make it happen). After all, as the campaign and his first few months in office prove, Trump puts his family above anything else. As the information continues to seep out about the work that Mueller is doing and the subpoenas begin to come, we believe the President will be increasingly frustrated and the administration will undoubtedly continue to seek to undermine Mueller’s credibility. And lets be clear, by any objective standard Mueller is an unassailable, apolitical public servant. “
Cristina Laila of the Gateway Pundit goes ahead to show a portion of the appointments that Mueller has made to move down what we definitely know to be a stacked deck with regards to those researching Trump. What Laila neglects to say however is that the wellspring of this 100-day forecast is Dan Abrams (who is the Managing Editor of Law Newz). This is the same Dan Abrams who was once General Manager of MSNBC while facilitating The Abrams Report.
Abrams is likewise the Chief Legal Analyst for NBC and his expectation is constructed absolutely in light of ill will for Trump and a conspicuous sycophantic reverence for Mueller, asserting that “by any objective standard Mueller is an unassailable, apolitical public servant????” Is this the Twilight Zone? Since when has any target standard at any point been doled out to a Leftist. What’s more, excuse me, yet “unassailable, apolitical?” Is this person joking? There is a huge amount of confirmation out there that shows the exact inverse. Decent attempt. Mueller stays and quite a while from now, this at last wraps up with a huge nothing to appear for the billions spent.

111 terminally ill patients ended their lives in six months under California right to die law,"28 Jun 2017 at 00:44 ET
Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story!
One hundred eleven people suffering terminal illnesses opted to take their own lives in the first six months of California’s “right to die” law, of 191 patients who received life-ending medication from their doctors.
The data, released Tuesday by the California Department of Public Health, looked at demographic information of qualified patients who obtained and used life-ending drugs. California enacted the End of Life Option Act in June 2016, allowing people with less than six months to live to request end-of-life drugs from their doctors.
Dan Diaz, the husband of right to die advocate Brittany Maynard, called the data “a testament” to his late wife’s “voice and advocacy that those 111 individuals had the ability to stay at home, under the care of their own medical team, and be surrounded by friends and family when they died.”
“Brittany didn’t have that. We had to move to Oregon for her to have a gentle passing,” Diaz said.
Maynard became a vocal advocate for the right to die in her last few months of life. After being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, Maynard moved to Oregon—which at the time was only one of four states to allow patients to take their own life.
Corinne Carey, the New York campaign director for the right to die advocacy group Compassion & Choices, said the data will help spearhead a similar effort in New York.
“I think this report will answer a lot of the questions people have had,” Carey said said. “We’ve had a lot of rich data out of Oregon, but Oregon is a pretty homogenous state. California is much more populous and diverse. It’s much more like New York.”
Carey told the New York Daily News the data should help dispel the concern among lawmakers that disadvantaged individuals will more actively seek out end-of-life medication.
“These are educated, health-literate people asking for some control over their death,” she said.
In a 2014 CNN op-ed explaining her decision, Maynard explained her decision, writing of her illness: “Because the rest of my body is young and healthy, I am likely to physically hang on for a long time even though cancer is eating my mind.”
“I do not want to die. But I am dying,” she wrote. “And I want to die on my own terms.”
She also explained her advocacy others facing a similar fate, noting while she and her husband were able to move to Oregon to obtain end-of-life medication, “the vast majority of families do not have the flexibility, resources and time to make all these changes.”
“As I look at the data, what goes through my mind is what a selfless, loving and caring person Brittany was to try to help these individuals suffering,” Diaz told the News.
“I’m so immensely proud of Brittany for deciding to speak up to help people she would never meet,” he said.

Veterans groups: Repealing Obamacare will hurt disabled and other vets",RawStory,1
Trump’s Voter Fraud Commission Is Facing A Tough Data Challenge,"Every state in the union was sent a letter last week seeking data from its voter rolls — including names, addresses, dates of birth, political party affiliation and the last four digits of voters’ Social Security numbers. The request came from Kris Kobach, vice chairman of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. States have responded in a variety of ways: About 20 have agreed to send publicly available data, including Kansas, where Kobach is secretary of state. Other states have said the commission can only have that data if they buy it. A few — including California and Mississippi — have said they won’t be complying with the request at all.
The commission was created by President Trump to investigate improper and fraudulent voting — an issue the president has said he believes is widespread (most experts disagree). The states’ arguments against compliance with its request have centered on skepticism of the commission’s intentions, as well as issues of privacy and political autonomy. But experts who have worked with voter data said the letter raised some other red flags for them. They said that although the idea of compiling and analyzing voter data makes sense — states and academics have been working on it for years — they’re concerned that the commission may not be adequately prepared to do the data analysis work it seems to want to take on.
Just a few years ago, compliance with a letter like this would likely have been impossible. Until recently, many states did not have voter data stored in a centralized location or collected in a uniform way. In most cases, the records existed only on paper. “Ten years ago, if you wanted to get voter data from Pennsylvania, you had to call every single county,” said Samantha Luks, managing director of scientific research for the polling organization YouGov.
And although states have made huge strides in internal record-keeping consistency and accessibility — largely because of funding and rules connected to the Help America Vote Act of 2002 — experts say that the way data is collected and stored still varies widely from state to state and that the information is not available in an easily shareable format. “This letter was almost identical to the type of letter I’ve seen sent out by graduate students who don’t know about election administration,” said Charles Stewart, professor of political science at MIT and co-director of the Voting Technology Project. “It’s like, ‘Oh, gee, there’s 50 states and D.C. and it’s probably on a file somewhere and they’ll just put it on a thumb drive and send it to me. How hard can it be?’”
Pretty hard, it turns out. The advisory commission letter did not spell out what it intends to do with the state-level data, beyond making it public in some way. That, combined with concerns about the security of the data storage, led the nonprofit Electronic Privacy Information Center to ask a U.S. district judge to issue a temporary restraining order to block the commission from gathering any state’s data.
In an email, Kobach’s state office in Kansas said it couldn’t comment on the commission or its plans. However, statements from Kobach suggest that the goal is to merge the entire country’s voter data into a single, searchable database that could then be cross-referenced with other sources, such as immigration records, to identify people who cannot legally vote or who are registered, and possibly voting, in multiple states. This has never been done before.
A national comparison of voter data is possible, experts said, but doing it right would require many hours of labor, large investments in data security and analysis systems, and many decisions about how to match and merge data in ways that will reduce the number of false positives (voter records that look like they belong to the same person, but don’t). The Electronic Registration Information Center — a nonprofit cooperative of 21 states and Washington, D.C., that share and analyze voter data in much the same way Kobach has proposed to do nationally — took almost three years just to set up its technical infrastructure, design privacy protection and member bylaws, and formalize a system for data input. The advisory commission is supposed to report results to the president by sometime next year. Stewart, Luks and others are concerned that the committee does not understand or appreciate the scale of its task.
In general, the idea of cross-checking and cleaning up state voter registries makes a great deal of sense, experts said, because those rolls are all but guaranteed to contain dead people, people who have moved and people whose names have changed.
From academic research and state records, we also know that there are relatively small numbers of people registered to vote who should not be — such as noncitizens or people who’ve been convicted of felonies. The state of Virginia, for instance, removed 404 noncitizens from its voter registration records from 2015 to 2016. (Among noncitizens who are registered to vote, a small subset make it to the polls and successfully cast a ballot. No one knows what the exact number is because there’s no centralized database of voter fraud cases.)
But figuring out who should be removed from voter rolls is no easy task. Experts who have worked with voter data say the commission would need to address three key problems.
First, the data is typically dirty, said Jan Leighley, who is a professor of government at American University and studies voting and voter behavior. By that, she means riddled with typos and complicated by people who are not easy to distinguish from one another. For instance, voter registration forms don’t always ask — and people don’t always note — whether they share a name with a relative. In a 2010 press conference before his election as Kansas secretary of state, Kobach cited the case of Albert K. Brewer, a dead man who was still voting, as an example of voter fraud. But the Topeka Capital-Journal found that Brewer was alive. Kobach’s staff had confused him with his father, also named Albert Brewer but with a different middle initial. The elder Brewer had indeed died, in 1996, on his son’s birthday.
A second problem is that there’s no such thing as a universal voter registration form. Some states collect data that other states don’t, and they store it in software systems that don’t necessarily play well together. Also, what information is publicly available varies widely from state to state, and states collect the same data but call it different things in their databases, said Shane Hamlin, executive director of the Electronic Registration Information Center. That creates problems when it comes time to use a computer to compare the files. The center requires participating states to edit records before submitting them so that every state submits the same categories of data under the same terminology. The advisory commission letter did not make that kind of request. Because of that, Leighley said, they’ll have to make decisions about how to reclassify data and constrain or expand the information available. If the commission’s data rules and methodology aren’t spelled out and transparent, it could be impossible for anyone to replicate the results.
Finally, once all the data is together, records will have to be matched — either state to state or to records in other databases — to find the people who are registered in multiple states or the people who show up on lists of felons and also on voter rolls. When it does this, ERIC uses an algorithm developed by IBM and previously used by the CIA. And the algorithm matters a lot. That, and the amount of information on each voter that you have access to, can have a big impact on results. That’s because this kind of search produces potential matches, not actual matches. Any attempt at using an algorithm to match voter records between databases will yield some false positives. Luks has worked on the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, one of the largest voter surveys in the U.S., and has used several of these programs to match people in that survey with actual voter records. None of them was perfect, she said.
But some are more prone to false positives than others. In addition to his other roles, Kobach runs Interstate Crosscheck, a free service that looks for matches between voter records. Twenty-eight states participate in the service, Samantha Poetter, Kobach’s director of public information, said in an email. Although similar in concept to ERIC, Interstate Crosscheck has a reputation for producing high numbers of false positives; its own documentation acknowledges that false positives are an issue. Research analyzing the accuracy of matching based on just first name, last name and birth date — Crosscheck’s method — suggests that this methodology is likely to turn up 200 false positives for every discovery of a true double voter. (That paper is still going through the process of peer review.) Virginia — a state that Stewart applauded for its high-quality voter registration data cleanup efforts — is a member of both ERIC and Interstate Crosscheck. In its 2016 voter data report, Virginia noted that Crosscheck was particularly prone to false positives. “The need to greatly refine and analyze Crosscheck data has required significant … staff resources that are not accounted for when proponents claim the program is ‘free.’”
And false positives can have a big impact on actual voters. States are not allowed to block people from voting based just on an algorithmic database match, Stewart said. In most cases, states send verification letters to people suspected of wrongly being registered to vote, who then have to document by a certain date that they are eligible. But the process can still end with legitimate voters’ being denied their rights. That happened in Florida in 2000, when at least 1,100 people were wrongly dropped from the voter registration rolls because a state analysis had incorrectly determined that they were convicted felons. The Palm Beach Post reported that the state had asked the company it contracted with to use broad parameters — in other words, to set up the data analysis so that it prioritized finding as many felons as possible, rather than limiting false positives.
Kobach has argued that voter fraud is rampant. But he has successfully prosecuted just nine cases of real illegal voting since he became the first secretary of state in the nation to be granted this kind of prosecutorial power, in 2015. As of January, Kobach’s number of total prosecutions wasn’t much higher than the number he had convicted. Only one conviction has involved a noncitizen voting.
Given the very real issues with out-of-date and poorly maintained voter registries, experts I spoke with didn’t want to see the issue ignored. Rather, they said the presidential commission is going about it the wrong way. To Stewart, the first step should have been a survey to find out what states are already doing to clean up their registries and what the federal government could do to make that task easier. Virginia, for instance, noted in the 2016 voter data report that the Help America Vote Act funding that helps support its efforts is dwindling. And Stewart noted that there is already an organization doing what the committee would like to do, but with well-established infrastructure. “A better use of resources would be to buy every state a subscription to ERIC and have the matches done in a highly professional way,” he said.",Five Thirty Eight,0

• President Trump lashed out Wednesday morning at Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, one of two Republicans who voted on Tuesday against beginning debate to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.

Where did everything leave off Tuesday night?
Understandably, confusion is rife over what the heck is happening on the Senate floor: What was that vote Tuesday night? Why did Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, give that impassioned speech saying he would not vote for the Senate health care bill as it stands, then turn around and cast a yes vote on Tuesday night?

When the Senate voted 51-50 to begin debating the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, technically senators were bringing the repeal bill that was passed in the House to the Senate floor. For now, that is the bill that senators are trying to reshape.
Continue reading the main story
On Tuesday night, Senate Republican leaders brought to the floor their most complete version of a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. That measure had been worked out behind closed doors by the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and it would dismantle major parts of the current health care law, including the requirement that most people have health insurance.
But it also included an overture to Senate conservatives, a measure championed by Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, that would allow insurance companies to sell stripped down, low-cost insurance plans as long as they also offer insurance policies that comply with federal standards, including the requirement that plans cover “essential” services like maternity care, mental health treatment and prescription drugs.

Because that broad version of the Senate health care measure had not yet been assessed by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, it needed 60 votes to overcome a Democratic objection that it violated Senate rules.
But it got only 43 votes, demonstrating that even after weeks of refining the legislation, Senate leaders still fell far short of enough support for their replacement plan, from both ends of the party’s ideological spectrum.
Mr. McCain had previously made clear that he wanted to secure amendments to that broad repeal-and-replace bill. The vote on Tuesday night could be interpreted as a sign of support for that general approach.
The debate goes on.
John McCain to Senate: ‘We’re Getting Nothing Done’
Senator John McCain, who was recently diagnosed with brain cancer, spoke to the Senate after casting his vote to begin debating legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
Watch in Times Video »
What’s happened so far on Wednesday?
Mr. Trump opened the day by attacking Ms. Murkowski.
Senator @lisamurkowski of the Great State of Alaska really let the Republicans, and our country, down yesterday. Too bad!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)
But Mr. Trump’s public shaming is not an effective strategy for Ms. Murkowski, who has dealt with worse from her party. In 2010, Ms. Murkowski retained her Senate seat in a historic win as a write-in candidate. She had lost Alaska’s Republican primary that year to a Tea Party challenger and was largely abandoned by Republican leadership. Since then, she has not felt beholden to her party.
Now what happens in the Senate?
Senators are set to consider a different repeal measure on Wednesday.
This measure would repeal major parts of the health law but would not provide a replacement. The legislation resembles a bill that passed the Senate in 2015 but was vetoed by President Barack Obama in early 2016.
Continue reading the main story
Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, supports that approach. But some Republicans worry that repealing the law without providing a replacement would leave many Americans without health care coverage. Such a “repeal only” measure is not expected to garner enough votes for passage.
The vote for this measure had been expected to take place around midday Wednesday, but it has now been delayed until later in the afternoon.
Republicans are using special budget rules to try to pass a repeal bill, so the debate is limited to 20 hours, and Democrats cannot delay it with a filibuster. Later this week, the Senate will hold what is known as a vote-a-rama, an exhausting marathon of amendment votes.
The nine Republicans who voted against the comprehensive replacement measure on Tuesday night are an indication of the problem that Senate Republican leaders continue to confront: The party caucus still does not agree on what should be in a health care repeal bill that would have enough support to win Senate approval.
One solution might be to pass a pared-down health plan that has support from at least 50 of the 52 Republican senators, and then turn to working out a compromise with the House.

“My Gang Is Bigger”: MS-13 Isn’t Scaring This Top ICE Official,"Posted by Lawrence Clayton | Jul 12, 2017 | National Security
ICE director, “My gang is bigger.”
He spoke about it all of the time. He brought them up on stage with him. He gave them a voice. Now, he’s giving them results.
When he was candidate Trump, the sometimes too straight talking, New Yorker often railed against the failure of the government to monitor the borders and keep it’s people safe. This is one of the primary functions of the federal government, and they were doing an awful job.
With the parents of Kate Steinle, Jamiel Shaw, Josh Wilkerson and many other families on stage recounting their sad stories of loss at the hands of an illegal immigrant, Mr. Trump vowed to do something about it.
During the third, and final, presidential debate, the Republican nominee vowed to get rid of the “bad, bad people” who are illegal in the United States. “But we have some bad hombres here and we’re going to get them out.” he said.
President Trump has been determined to get the El Salvadorian gang out of America.
“No one really listened to us, our story really wasn’t heard,” said Sabine Durden, whose son was killed by an illegal. “When I heard Mr Trump, I started screaming. Finally, someone who had the guts to say what millions are thinking.”
Mrs. Durden is not the only American who finally feels heard, for once, and now that Trump is president, and one of the most vocal opponents to illegal immigration, Jeff Sessions, is the Attorney General, things on the illegal immigration front are getting done.
Since his victory, we have seen that a big part of that vow meant deporting violent gang members. Enemy numero uno: the vicious El Salvadorian gang known as MS-13.
The El Salvadorian gang, which Sessions estimates to be 10,000 spread across 40 U.S. states, has “evolved into one of the most violent and murderous gangs in the world,” according to one police commissioner.
Of the illegal immigrant gangs ICE has been targeting, MS-13 is #1.
In recent testimony, top law officials informed Congress on just how vicious, savage and evil this South American gang is.
Timothy Sini, police commissioner of Suffolk County (N.Y.) Police Department, testified to the fact that MS-13 preys on illegal immigrants for its members, and that the median age is just 18.
Even though they are young, they are no less vicious. Mr. Sini testified to that fact, telling Congress that what “distinguishes the MS-13 homicides is the premeditation, brutality and callousness in which they were committed; with many of the victims suffering from multiple blunt force trauma and stab wounds and left in shallow graves in isolated wooded areas.”
“Some of which as a 22-year investigator I’ve never investigated before,” Scott Conley, a detective with the Chelsea, Massachusetts Police Department and a member of an FBI task force, told Congress before adding, “To include cutting off of limbs, and the attempt to cut off a victim’s head with a machete.”
Sini also told Congress that MS-13 has “evolved into one of the most violent and murderous gangs in the world.”
In 2017 3,111 gang members have been arrested, and 2,798 deported. 357 MS-13 members have been deported.
Since President Trump was sworn in, there has been an attitude shift in dealing with criminal, violent gangs, not just MS-13. Since early January, ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) has increased its number of gang raids and the number of gang members arrested has also increased since that time.
Raids conducted have led to the arrests of 3,111 gang members, 2,798 of those have been deported in 2017, so far. Of the total arrested, over 10% were MS-13 members, 357 to be exact.
Just one recent ICE HSI joint operation with local New York law enforcement, was very successful. That series of raids, across 30 days, resulted in the arrest of 39 MS-13 members.
Another member of the team taking on this gang is Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director Thomas Homan. Recently, Mr. Homan showed that he is up to the task of taking down this group of savages when he told The Daily Caller “My gang is bigger than theirs and we are going to take them out.”
ICE acting director Homan tells MS-13 my “gang is bigger.”
“That’s the goal. The president supports that. We’re going to follow through on the president’s promise and we are going to take out MS-13 as much as we can.” While HSI “targets many gangs”, according to Homan, he did tell The DC Caller that they were concentrating their efforts on MS-13, since “they seem to be the most violent right now and they think they can act with impunity.”
The gang is finding out that this administration will fearlessly take them on, and not let them act with such freedom. That bold action seems to be having a lot of success. In a June cabinet meeting, the president said MS-13 is being “depleted” and “will be gone pretty soon.” To those families that believed in Mr. Trump, now President Trump, it must feel like a small victory. Nothing will ever bring back their loved ones, but being heard and having justice done can bring a lot of closure.",Conservative Daily Post,1

‘His fragility is in play’: CNN panel explains why Trump is really lashing out at the media,"06 Jul 2017 at 23:35 ET
Charles blow and Brian Stelter (Photo: Screen capture)
Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story!
President Donald Trump can’t stop talking about how unfair the media is to him. His dedication to the nation, however, seems to be less of a concern, according to some on a Thursday CNN panel.
During a discussion on Don Lemon’s show, both New York Times opinion columnist Charles Blow and CNN media analyst Brian Stelter found Trump’s strange diversion in his speech to Poland curious.
“I thought it was revealing the way he was doing that saying, ‘NBC, I made them a lot of money with ‘The Apprentice,’ they take care of me, but they’re so mean to me,” Stelter said. “It shows the transactional way he thinks of the media, the way he thinks about business and maybe about politics and governing. But let’s make no mistake, we’re seeing this coordinating campaign by Trump and his allies to tear down news outlets they don’t like, news outlets that are trying to hold them accountable. It happens to be CNN today. It happens to be NBC on Trump’s mind today. It will be others as well. It’s been others in the past, others in the future. What Polish citizens and American citizens have in common is a desire for a truly free press.”
Lemon noted that Trump is particularly hard on CNN because he feels that the network hurt him the most. Lemon did not mention, however, that CNN head Jeff Zucker was the one who gave Trump his first start with “The Apprentice,” and for a while Trump believed Zucker was his friend and ally.
“In addition to what you’re saying, it underlines the incredible narcissism of the president,” Blow said. “I mean, everything he says is about ‘how the press has treated me,’ how ‘NBC has treated me,’ ‘what I did for them and they didn’t repay me.’ It is never about — even the investigation, the Russia investigation, it’s never about the health of the country. It’s never about protecting the institutions that make the country great. It’s never about, like, ‘something that is bigger than me.’ It is always about — ‘everything that is as small as me’ with this man.”
Blow said that once Americans and the press begin viewing Trump through this lens that his actions become more clear.
“Not that it makes it right, it just makes it make sense that he cannot see anything greater than himself,” Blow continued. “That kind of drags the presidency down. That drags the country down. That makes us all sit around and talk about these — talk about his feelings and whether or not his fragility is in play and whether or not he is something that someone said that he didn’t agree with and that he now tosses around the idea of fake news as if it is interchangeable with whether or not it is laudatory for me or not. And that’s crazy.”
At the beginning of the segment, Lemon noted that Trump’s comments to the Polish president were particularly curious given what has happened there. The country recently placed restrictions on the press in Poland in which people took to the streets against the crackdown to curtail access, as Stelter noted.

Last Updated Jul 25, 2017 8:48 AM EDT
BEIJING -- China on Tuesday denied its fighter jet pilots operated dangerously during an encounter with a U.S. surveillance plane in international airspace in which the American pilot took evasive action to avoid a possible collision.
Spokesman Ren Guoqiang said in a statement on the defense ministry's microblog that the performance of the pilots of the two J-10 fighters was ""legal, necessary and professional.""
Ren criticized frequent close-in surveillance runs by U.S. planes as raising the chance of accidents, saying such missions ""threatened China's national security, harmed China-U.S. sea-air military safety, endangered the safety of pilots from the two sides and were the root cause of China-U.S. sea-air unexpected incidents.""
The U.S. should stop such ""unsafe, unprofessional and unfriendly military activities,"" Ren said, in a repetition of China's standard policy toward U.S. surveillance missions intended at collecting Chinese computer and voice data in hopes of gaining insight into the workings of the People's Liberation Army.
Lt. Cmdr. Matt Knight, a spokesperson for the U.S. Pacific Fleet in Hawaii, told CBS News the incident is still under investigation but, ""initial reports from the U.S. aircrew characterized the intercept as unsafe.""
Knight said the issue is being addressed with China through ""appropriate diplomatic and military channels.""
Asked about the incident at a daily briefing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Beijing objected to such missions but remained ""committed to building military mutual trust with other countries.""
U.S. Navy Capt. Jeff Davis said the Chinese fighters intercepted the U.S. EP-3 surveillance plane Sunday in international airspace between the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea, in an area he described as west of the Korean Peninsula.
Davis said one of the Chinese planes approached at a high rate of speed from beneath the American plane, then slowed and pulled up, prompting the EP-3 pilot to take evasive action. He called the Chinese pilot's move unsafe.
A spokesperson with the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet told CBS News the incident was ""highly unusual,"" especially since there was no communication between the pilots of the J-10 and EP-3.
""The U.S. and Chinese have good Navy to Navy relationship. Intercepts happen all the time. When something like an unsafe intercept happens it's generally a communication breakdown, but this point they couldn't say what caused this particular incident,"" the spokesperson said.
China in 2013 declared an air defense identification zone over a partly contested portion of the East China Sea, demanding foreign aircraft declare their presence and follow Chinese orders. The U.S. and others swiftly dismissed the zone as invalid and have largely ignored it. It wasn't clear if Sunday's encounter took place inside the zone.
Such incidents continue to occur despite an agreement between the two sides to prevent them from sparking an international crisis, as happened in April 2001 when a Chinese jet fighter collided with a U.S. EP-3. That led to the death of the Chinese pilot and China's detention of the U.S. air crew for 10 days after their crippled plane landed at a PLA Navy air base on the island province of Hainan.
While China has long chafed at U.S. surveillance operations targeting its military, the PLA itself has been conducting such missions further and further from its home ports.
Earlier this month, China sailed a spy ship through the narrow Tsugaru Strait separating the Japanese islands of Honshu and Hokkaido, while another was spotted last week within Australia's exclusive economic zone where allies Australia and U.S. were conducting major war games.

Demonstrators carry a piece of concrete as they gather in front of an Air Force base during a rally against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government in Caracas, Venezuela, June 24, 2017.
CARACAS Organization of American States President Luis Almagro offered on Saturday to resign if Venezuela holds free elections and enacts reforms to protect democracy in the troubled South American nation.
""I will resign from the Organization of American States the day that free, fair and transparent national elections are held without impediments,"" Almagro said in a video message posted on Twitter.
""I offer my position in exchange for freedom in Venezuela,"" he added.
At its annual general assembly in Mexico this week, the OAS failed to reach consensus on a resolution about Venezuela, where 75 people have died in three months of protests.
Demonstrators are demanding general elections to end 18 years of socialist rule in the once wealthy OPEC nation, racked by rising poverty and a deepening economic and political crisis.
Almagro conditioned his resignation offer on a long list of demands, including the release of political prisoners and a guarantee of Supreme Court independence.
Venezuela's Supreme Court is packed with judges loyal to the government and in April took over the functions of the opposition-controlled Congress, before the decision was revoked under international pressure.
The opposition says Venezuela has hundreds of political prisoners, including leading politician Leopoldo Lopez. The government says they are coup plotters and criminals.
President Nicolas Maduro had said on Thursday that if Almagro, an outspoken critic of his government, resigned he would consider reversing a decision to withdraw Venezuela from the 34-nation OAS bloc.
Maduro offered no immediate response to Almagro's offer on Saturday. But he has called the OAS chief ""immoral"" in the past and considers the regional group a puppet of Washington intent on toppling his government.
The opposition wants Maduro to bring forward next year's presidential election. Instead, however, the president has called for the election of a constitutional assembly on July 30 to draft a new constitution.
The opposition has said it will boycott the assembly vote, which critics see as a rigged process to help the unpopular government stay in power.
The opposition organized marches to military bases around the country on Saturday to demonstrate against the killing of a 22-year-old protester who was shot dead by a military police sergeant on Thursday, as youths tried to pull down the fence around an air force base in Caracas..
Thousands of Saturday's protesters gathered on a highway outside the air force site in Caracas.

"In Clash Over Health Bill, a Growing Fear of ‘Junk Insurance’","Continue reading the main storyShare This Page

Julie Arkison remembers what it was like to buy health insurance before the Affordable Care Act created standards for coverage. The policy she had was from the same insurer that covers her now, but it did not pay for doctor visits, except for a yearly checkup and gynecological exam.
“I couldn’t even go to my regular doctor when was I sick,” said Ms. Arkison, 53, a self-employed horseback-riding teacher in Saline, Mich.
The plan did not cover her exams before and after hip surgery, her physical therapy after her operation, the crutches she needed while she recovered, or any of her medications. She estimates that she spent $20,000 on medical care in the seven years before she could buy a plan through the marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act.
As Senate Republican leaders struggle to secure enough votes to repeal and replace the health law, the centerpiece of their effort to win conservative support is a provision that would allow insurers to sell such bare-bones plans again. The new version of the bill released on Thursday incorporates an idea from Senator Ted Cruz of Texas that would permit insurers to market all types of plans as long as they offer ones that comply with Affordable Care Act standards. The measure would also allow companies to take into account people’s health status in determining whether to insure them and at what price.

State insurance regulators say the proposal harks back to the days when insurance companies, even household names like Aetna and Blue Cross, sold policies so skimpy they could hardly be called coverage at all. Derided as “junk insurance,” the plans had very low premiums but often came with five-figure deductibles. Many failed to pay for medical care that is now deemed essential.
Continue reading the main story
One Aetna plan, for example, defined hospitalization coverage as mainly for room and board. It capped coverage at $10,000 for “other hospital services,” a category that included such routine care as medication and operating room expenses.
The Affordable Care Act drastically changed the health insurance landscape by requiring insurers to offer a set of comprehensive benefits — including hospitalization, doctor visits, prescription drugs, maternity care and mental health and substance abuse treatment — in order to formally qualify as insurance. “The new bill opens the door to junk insurance,” said Dave Jones, the California insurance commissioner.
Ned Scott, 34, who lives in Tucson, said the health plan he had before the Affordable Care Act left him with $40,000 to $50,000 in unpaid medical bills after he learned he had testicular cancer when he was in his late 20s.
“I thought it would cover things,” Mr. Scott said. But once he needed it, he learned the plan limited what it paid for outpatient care to $2,000 a year, and all of his treatment, from chemotherapy to CT scans, seemed to fall in that category.
Many Republicans, including President Trump, say giving insurers the leeway to offer less-comprehensive plans will give people greater choice and cheaper options. The Senate bill “ensures consumers have the freedom to choose among more affordable plans that are tailored to their individual health care needs,” Mr. Cruz said.
Proponents of the bill argue that it would allow people to buy insurance they could not otherwise afford. Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, said he supported the idea of allowing insurers to sell plans that do not comply with the rules under the Affordable Care Act. The current proposal, Mr. Flake told The Arizona Republic in a recent interview, would allow “183,000 Arizonans who can’t afford insurance because it’s just too expensive to buy a product that meets their needs.”

But both consumer advocates and insurers — forces that are not often allied — are wary. They predict that healthy, younger people would most likely gravitate to the cheaper policies, believing they do not need the more comprehensive and expensive coverage, while older people with health conditions would see their premiums soar for more comprehensive plans.
On Friday evening, the insurance industry’s two main trade associations, America’s Health Insurance Plans and BlueCross BlueShield Association, sent a letter to the Senate voicing adamant opposition to the plan, which they say would create two distinct markets. The proposal “is simply unworkable in any form and would undermine protections for those with pre-existing medical conditions, increase premiums and lead to widespread terminations of coverage for people currently enrolled in the individual market,” the groups wrote.

Plans with much lower premiums are certain to be attractive to many people. But Elizabeth Imholz, a health policy expert for Consumers Union, warned, “The reality for consumers is that they can be stuck with huge, unexpected out-of-pocket costs.”

The Republican proposal also encourages the sale to small businesses of cheaper, less-comprehensive plans modeled after so-called association health plans that were in vogue decades ago, allowing associations or groups of like businesses to come together to buy insurance. The Republican bill would allow small businesses and people who are self-employed to buy plans that would be largely exempt from the current Affordable Care Act rules as well as state oversight.
That, too, has drawn concern. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which represents state regulators, wrote a letter to the Senate contending that the provision “appears to block the ability of states to preserve important consumer protections, effectively oversee the plans, or ensure a level playing field.”
Association plans, which had been virtually unregulated because they were not under the purview of any state rules, have had a mixed history. Some plans failed because they did not have the money to pay for their customers’ medical bills, while some insurance companies were accused of misleading people about what they would cover.
These plans are “just the classic example of insurance that disappears exactly when you need it,” said Jay Angoff, a former state insurance official in Missouri and New Jersey, who also worked in the Obama administration overseeing the insurance marketplace.
Antony Stuart, a lawyer who lives in California, has brought more than a dozen lawsuits accusing insurance companies of misleading consumers by selling them policies that provided much less coverage than they realized.
Mr. Stuart recalled one case involving a man, Doug Christensen, who bought a policy from Mega Life and Health Insurance, which was the subject of numerous lawsuits and state regulatory actions. Mr. Christensen, who previously had bone cancer, was assured by the insurance agent selling the policy that he would have adequate coverage if the cancer returned. But the plan limited payments toward chemotherapy to just $1,000 a day of treatment when the actual cost was sometimes 10 times that amount. Mr. Christensen was left with nearly $500,000 in unpaid medical bills.
“These plans lacked the necessary transparency that would give consumers an idea of what they were actually purchasing,” said Ashley Blackburn, a senior policy analyst with Community Catalyst, a consumer advocacy group. People buying plans now benefit not only from the standards the federal law sets but also from the fact that policies are clearly divided into categories with set levels of coverage. “We’re really moving back to a market where people are going to have a hard time reading through their plan options.”
The association plans, in particular, would make small businesses and self-employed individuals more vulnerable to policies that would leave them unprotected. State regulators cracked down after some of these plans became insolvent. Four associations in the early 2000s left their customers with nearly $50 million in unpaid medical bills, according to researchers in an overview of the plans’ history published in the journal Health Affairs.
Many states adopted a more aggressive stance as a result, but the Senate proposal would make plans largely exempt from state oversight. “There are a lot of consumer protection laws that states have passed that would have to be overruled or ignored,” said Rebecca Owen, a health research actuary with the Society of Actuaries.

A few weeks ago, Ms. Arkison came down with a bad cough. Her doctor prescribed antibiotics, steroids and an inhaler. She is thankful that her current insurance lets her see the doctor when she becomes ill. Under her old plan, she said, “I could not have gone in.”

Liberal magazine editor says Trump will incite conservative violence against liberal journalists,"Sarah Taylor 44 mins
Editor-in-Chief of The Atlantic worries that President Donald Trump will incite violence against liberal journalists.
The Editor-in-Chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, told Katie Couric during the Aspen Ideas conference on Wednesday that he worries that President Donald Trump is turning the American public against liberal journalists to the point of violence.
He added that if violence against journalists were to occur, Trump would solely shoulder the blame.
After Couric asked Goldberg his thoughts on Trump continually blasting “fake news” outlets — i.e., CNN, The Washington Post, and The New York Times, to name a few — Goldberg claimed that his biggest concern for the media at large is a physical, violent attack on liberal journalists.
Couric said, “When the president constantly tweets that different newspapers are examples of ‘fake news’ … and accuses reporters of being ‘fake news’ at White House briefings or when he appears before reporters there, what’s your reaction?”
Goldberg responded, “Part of my reaction is that we’re all engaged in a reality TV show, that this is a reality TV version of a war between a president and the press.”
He continued, “The problem is, and this is what I worry about more than anything else, is that there are people in the country who don’t understand that [Trump’s ‘war’ on the media] is a cynical reality TV game and are going to hear over and over again from the president that reporters, journalists are enemies of the state.”
He added, “And someone, I mean God forbid, someone is going to do something violent against journalists in a large way, and then I know where the fault lies. And we’re heading in this direction, and it’s quite frightening.”

Judge Napolitano weighs in on Trump Jr. meeting with Russians and his take might just surprise you… [VIDEO],"Jul. 17, 2017 12:25 pm by   • No Comments
Judge Napolitano wasn’t here last week as the news was breaking that Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer in 2016 under the auspices that she was affiliated with the Kremlin and had some dirt on Hillary that would help Trump win.
But he’s here now and here’s his take:
Napolitano says it’s suspicious that Kushner didn’t tell this FBI about it wants to know why he appears to have been hiding it:
Why didn’t Jared Kushner tell the FBI about it when he filled out his national security application, unless he was trying to hide something. If he was trying to hide something was it that this was a bumbling foolish thing to do or was this the beginning of some steps in furtherance of acquiring this information?
Napolitano argues that many non-violent crimes occur in stages and that based on what we know about this meeting, that it’s suspicious enough to warrant a criminal investigation to get answers to these questions.",The Right Scoop,1

MOSCOW/KIEV A ransomware attack hit computers across the world on Tuesday, taking out servers at Russia's biggest oil company, disrupting operations at Ukrainian banks, and shutting down computers at multinational shipping and advertising firms.
Cyber security experts said those behind the attack appeared to have exploited the same type of hacking tool used in the WannaCry ransomware attack that infected hundreds of thousands of computers in May before a British researcher created a kill-switch.
""It's like WannaCry all over again,"" said Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer with Helsinki-based cyber security firm F-Secure.
He said he expected the outbreak to spread in the Americas as workers turned on vulnerable machines, allowing the virus to attack. ""This could hit the U.S.A. pretty bad,"" he said.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it was monitoring reports of cyber attacks around the world and coordinating with other countries.
The first reports of organizations being hit emerged from Russia and Ukraine, but the impact quickly spread westwards to computers in Romania, the Netherlands, Norway, and Britain.
Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk, which handles one out of seven containers shipped globally, said the attack had caused outages at its computer systems across the world on Tuesday, including at its terminal in Los Angeles.
Pharmaceutical company Merck & Co said its computer network had been affected by the global hack.
A Swiss government agency also reported computer systems were affected in India, though the country's cyber security agency said it had yet to receive any reports of attacks.
""DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME""
After the Wannacry attack, organizations around the globe were advised to beef up IT security.
""Unfortunately, businesses are still not ready and currently more than 80 companies are affected,"" said Nikolay Grebennikov, vice president for R&D; at data protection firm Acronis.
One of the victims of Tuesday's cyber attack, a Ukrainian media company, said its computers were blocked and it had a demand for $300 worth of the Bitcoin crypto-currency to restore access to its files.
""If you see this text, then your files are no longer accessible, because they have been encrypted. Perhaps you are busy looking for a way to recover your files, but don't waste your time. Nobody can recover your files without our decryption service,"" the message said, according to a screenshot posted by Ukraine's Channel 24.
The same message appeared on computers at Maersk offices in Rotterdam and at businesses affected in Norway.
Other companies that said they had been hit by a cyber attack included Russian oil producer Rosneft, French construction materials firm Saint Gobain and the world's biggest advertising agency, WPP - though it was not clear if their problems were caused by the same virus.
""The building has come to a standstill. It's fine, we've just had to switch everything off,"" said one WPP employee who asked not to be named.
Cyber security firms scrambled to understand the scope and impact of the attacks, seeking to confirm suspicions hackers had leveraged the same type of hacking tool exploited by WannaCry, and to identify ways to stop the onslaught.
Experts said the latest ransomware attacks unfolding worldwide, dubbed GoldenEye, were a variant of an existing ransomware family called Petya.
It uses two layers of encryption which have frustrated efforts by researchers to break the code, according to Romanian security firm Bitdefender.
""There is no workaround to help victims retrieve the decryption keys from the computer,"" the company said.
Russian security software maker Kaspersky Lab, however, said its preliminary findings suggested the virus was not a variant of Petya but a new ransomware not seen before.
Last's month's fast-spreading WannaCry ransomware attack was crippled after a 22-year-old British security researcher Marcus Hutchins created a so-called kill-switch that experts hailed as the decisive step in slowing the attack.
Any organization that heeded strongly worded warnings in recent months from Microsoft Corp to urgently install a security patch and take other steps appeared to be protected against the latest attacks.
Ukraine was particularly badly hit, with Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman describing the attacks on his country as ""unprecedented"".
An advisor to Ukraine's interior minister said the virus got into computer systems via ""phishing"" emails written in Russian and Ukrainian designed to lure employees into opening them.
According to the state security agency, the emails contained infected Word documents or PDF files as attachments.
Yevhen Dykhne, director of the Ukrainian capital's Boryspil Airport, said it had been hit. ""In connection with the irregular situation, some flight delays are possible,"" Dykhne said in a post on Facebook. A Reuters reporter who visited the airport late on Tuesday said flights were operating as normal.
Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Pavlo Rozenko said the government's computer network had gone down and the central bank said a operation at a number of banks and companies, including the state power distributor, had been disrupted by the attack.
""As a result of these cyber attacks these banks are having difficulties with client services and carrying out banking operations,"" the central bank said in a statement.
Russia's Rosneft, one of the world's biggest crude producers by volume, said its systems had suffered ""serious consequences"" from the attack. It said it avoided any impact on oil production by switching to backup systems.
The Russian central bank said there were isolated cases of lenders' IT systems being infected by the cyber attack. One consumer lender, Home Credit, had to suspend client operations.

Programmer Uses Coding Skills to Exact Revenge on Fake IRS Phone Scammers,"Phone scammers who were claiming to be IRS agents got more than they bargained for when they contacted a computer programmer who specializes in scam prevention. After verifying the call wasn’t actually from the IRS, the programmer created a script designed to stop their operation in its tracks, making it nearly impossible for them to contact anyone else.
The computer programmer, who goes by the username YesItWasDataMined on the popular Reddit site and is also the operator of an anti-scam organization called Project Mayhem, received a voicemail from a person who claimed to be an agent with the IRS.
He called the number back and decided to record the conversation. He was told he owed a substantial fine, that a lawsuit had been filed against him, that local authorities “will be at your place,” and even that his property could be seized to repay the debt. He was accused of attempting to “defraud the government” and that there was an outstanding amount of $8,219 owed.
The person couldn’t clearly explain why he allegedly owed the money, saying only that there was a miscalculation on the amount owed from the previous tax year. The programmer knew it was an attempt to scam him.
He quickly came up with an idea that was designed to interrupt their operation. The programmer created a script that would call the phone numbers associated with the scammers 28 times per second, playing an automated message when they answered the call. This process would tie up with phone lines, making it nearly impossible for them to contact potential victims.
The automated message stated, “Hello. It has been detected that you are a scammer. Because of this, we are now flooding your phone lines to prevent you from scamming additional people. This will not stop until you stop.”
The programmer recorded these calls as well, compiling the experience into a video he shared on YouTube. “Agents” answering the calls become noticeably frustrated, asking, “Who told you?” and saying, “Who are you first of all? I’m asking your name!”
Throughout the bombardment, the scammers attempt to block the numbers associated with the incoming calls, but the programmer asserts that can’t be done.
At various points during the audio, the scammers are recorded speaking in Hindi.
As the scammers get more frustrated, they even admit to what they are doing. One recipient of the automated call is recorded saying, “Yes, I know I am a scammer, and I’m proud to be a scammer m***erf***er!”
Another even makes threats, saying, “I’m going to f*** you up, m***erf***er. Don’t f*** with me, ok? You better run scared, I’m going to skin your head, m***erf***er!”
At the time the video was posted on YouTube, the flooder had been running for three days, preventing any other calls from being placed or received by the scammers.
According to the IRS, thousands of people have fallen victim to various scams involving fake IRS communications, costing people millions of dollars. The agency also states they do not “threaten taxpayers with lawsuits, imprisonment or other enforcement action” and that individuals should consider such threats “telltale signs of a phishing or tax scam.”",The Tribunist,1

"Trey Gowdy says Democrats are making “reckless, baseless allegations” on Trump collusion with Russia","Jun. 21, 2017 9:37 am by The Right Scoop • No Comments
Trey Gowdy explained last night that despite the media’s hyperfocus on the Russian collusion probe with respect to Trump, that is really only a subset of the investigation into Russian active measures and it’s not just about Trump, but about anyone colluding with the Russians.
Gowdy not only blames the media for their hyperfocus, but puts some of that on Democrats who he says are making both reckless and baseless allegations about Trump which are just not true.
So far there is still no evidence of collusion.
He also points out that he’d like all of the interviews to be done by labor day, but he admits that would be a perfect world scenario.
I hope they finish this soon because at this point I don’t disagree with those like Ted Cruz who call this a political circus. The liberal media wants Trump to be guilty, but even if he isn’t they want this cloud to hang over his presidency for as long as they can.
Heck, even as we see at the beginning of this interview, David Brooks himself is feeling uneasy about this investigation now because there is just no evidence to support the accusations thus far.
As for myself I’m totally ready to move on because the whole thing is just tiresome.",TheRightScoop,1

The EU Can't Afford to Ignore Europe's Migrant Crisis,"Brussels should help eastern Europe forge an effective funding and financing plan to help stop the conflict in Syria.
A lot has been happening in the midst of the European migrant crisis. Most notably, the political debate between EU member states is widening on how to best handle this significantly deteriorating crisis. Specifically, the Visegrad Group, consisting of Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, have opposed Brussels’ quota system on accepting refugees from war-torn areas. Criticism of the Visegrad countries, known as the V4, specifically on this ground, is unjustified, and rather than focusing on efforts to distribute thousands of migrants, Brussels must focus on helping resolve the crisis so that people are not forced to undertake this journey to Europe.
First, there is no guarantee that all migrants seeking refuge in Europe are indeed coming from war-torn regions in Syria and Iraq, and this is highlighted by the lack of documentation on hand during the current crisis. Countries might have significantly effective vetting systems but these fail to work if documentation is unavailable or can be forged. With the risk of stating the obvious, no country desires an influx of unidentified individuals.
Second, and most importantly, the V4 countries are correct in their decision on the grounds of ensuring safety and security for their own citizens. The migrant crisis in Europe has been correlated with a huge influx of crime. In Germany, which has accepted the largest number of migrants, this has increased by more than 50 percent since the previous year. This was manifested in the Cologne New Year’s Eve sexual assault incident, where most of the perpetrators were migrants.
In parallel, Europe has witnessed some of the worst attacks of terrorism on its soil since the beginning of this crisis. While most of these attacks have been conducted by their own citizens who have either fought for or supported ISIS, some attacks have seen the involvement of foreigners who have taken advantage of the migrant crisis to enter Europe. Two of the terrorists in the November 2015 Paris attacks, who eventually blew themselves up outside the Stade de France, had entered Europe on fake Syrian passports. A year later, a Tunisian man murdered a Polish driver and drove his truck at a Christmas market in Berlin, leading to Germany’s worst terror attack since the start of the crisis. In light of these events, the V4 countries have been reluctant to accept migrants. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who heads the ruling PiS party in Poland, has asserted that security considerations are the reason for Poland’s stance. And as recent events have shown, he is right.

Leftists LOSING THEIR MINDS: Trump Kicks off Made in America Week [VIDEO],"by Ethan Sabo | Jul 18, 2017
 
Donald Trump won the presidency by vowing to Make America Great Again.
The slogan may have seemed corny at the time, but he meant it.
Americans had certainly soured on “Change we can believe in.” The Era of Chump Change was over!
Thus on Sunday evening, the Trump administration announced “Made in America” week at the White House. Recall that Trump’s second catchphrase is “America First!”
Thus, during “Made in America” week, the White House would showcase an array of goods produced in the United States.
The White House is hosting a “Made in America” product showcase Monday afternoon, featuring products from all 50 states. Asked about the impact of the campaign on the Trump Organization and on Ivanka Trump’s company, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday it’s “not appropriate” for him to discuss how the campaign would affect Trump businesses, which make many of their products overseas. Still, he conceded that there might be limits to bringing some manufacturing back to the U.S.
“Cetrain industries we don’t do as much anymore in terms of scalability,” Spicer told reporters at the White House briefing, just before the Made in America event. “Certain things we may not have capacity to do here, in terms of a plant or factory.”
The president also is expected to issue a proclamation Wednesday on the importance of making goods in America, and will travel to Virginia on Saturday for the commissioning of the USS Gerald R. Ford, a new aircraft carrier.

Thus, they don’t want to “Make American Great Again” by putting “America First.”
It’s really that simple. The Washington Post tried to poo poo on the event, citing the Trumps don’t make all their products in the United States.
But because the Trump Organization and related companies haven’t seen fit to produce their own goods in the United States, that means either their products aren’t the best or Trump is engaged in a craven manipulation of his fans. Or both.
If America produces the best craftsmanship, why, then, does Ivanka Trump’s company manufacture no items in the United States? As The Post reported just last week, her company relies “exclusively on foreign factories,” including in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam and China, to manufacture the shoes, handbags, blouses, dresses, jeans and shirts for the first daughter’s line of clothing.
Similarly, many items in Trump’s own clothing and home accessories are produced overseas in countries including China, Bangladesh and Mexico. When he excoriates American companies for moving manufacturing jobs overseas, then, he is including himself in his own criticism — but of course would never admit that. Instead, when questioned about why he manufactures items overseas, his answer was, essentially, everyone else does it.
Really? I recall President Trump not running from his guilt, but saying he was part of the problem he now wants to solve.
Give me one story where WaPo or any other toilet paper media criticized Obama for “do as I say, not as I do.” This man supposedly championed the poor, while living the life of a king.
Vacations, partying with the wealthy, and a host of other atrocities, and not a peep from the leftists.
Thankfully, President Trump doesn’t care what leftists think. He will do the right thing, and I for one support companies who manufacture in America. I hope you join me in seeking out these companies, particularly.

Ten Indian nationals have died and six have been hospitalised after a fire broke out in a windowless house shared by Indian and Bangladeshi workers in Southern Najran city in Saudi Arabia. External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj through a series of tweets has said that she is in touch with India’s Consul General in Jeddah and added that staff members of the Indian mission will leave for Najran by the first available flight saying that the city is 900 kilometers away from Jeddah. The External Affairs Minister also tweeted that she has been in touch with the Governor of Najran, Prince Jluwi bin Abdelaziz who, along with the Consul General, are keeping her abreast of the latest updates on a regular basis.
The Saudi Gazette has added that firefighters put out a fire in a building in which workers from South Asia were staying. The report added that the building in which the workers were residing was windowless and that the workers died due to asphyxiation. The workers who were living in the building were employed by a construction firm. As per a PTI report, the fire was caused by a short circuit in an old air-conditioning unit.
Prince Jluwi bin Abdelaziz has ordered a probe into the fire. The Prince has also expressed concerns over the absence of control in the conditions in which workers from other nations reside. Prince Abdelaziz, as per the PTI report, said the municipality should stop companies from renting buildings which are not fit for living.",Financial Express,0
"Liberal Nitwits On ‘The View’ Learn Trump’s Travel Ban Is Reinstated, Epic Meltdown Ensues","June 26, 2017JodiPolitics, U.S. News
Sunny Hostin (left), President Donald Trump (center), Whoopi Goldberg (right)
In a landmark decision on Monday morning, the Supreme Court of the United States reinstated President Donald Trump’s travel ban without a single judge dissenting. When the liberal nitwits on ABC’s The View got wind of this news, a meltdown of epic proportions ensued on the daytime talk show.
The Supreme Court will be reviewing President Trump’s travel ban fully in the fall, but in the meantime, travelers from Libya, Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen will not be able to enter the country unless they can prove they have ties to an entity or person already here. According to Reuters, also going into effect will be a temporary suspension of the United States’ refugee program.
Clearly triggered, Whoopi Goldberg launched in hysterics, decrying, “I just hope that when we go outside today, Lady Liberty has not walked off, because the nature of the refugee is they are fleeing. They are fleeing a country which is oppressing them,” she added. “And so, all I can say is, we’ll keep an eye on this because this is not the end,” she continued. “It’s slightly annoying, but it’s not the end.”
In typical liberal fashion, Goldberg and her fellow goons have chosen fear-mongering over common sense. Trump is not targeting the oppressed, but simply protecting the people whom his first priority is to; namely, American citizens.
The fact of the matter is that Lady Liberty is threatened each time a so-called “refugee” is allowed to enter the United States without first undergoing a thorough and comprehensive vetting process, which we do not have at this time, thanks to the incompetence of the previous administration. In other words, American citizens cannot live a life of freedom and liberty when their very safety is under attack by those with values and motives contrary to their own.
Unfortunately, many of the people entering the U.S. from the countries named in the president’s travel ban do not wish to assimilate to our way of life. On the contrary, they are dead set on destroying Western culture as we know it. Until we have an effective way to weed out the radicals from those who are truly fleeing persecution, it is not worth the risk to allow anyone and everyone claiming to be a refugee into the United States.
Goldberg can “keep an eye on” the situation if she likes, but I dare say President Trump is doing a far better job of handling our national security than she is by running her big mouth on daytime television.

WASHINGTON U.S. lawmakers on the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee asked the Pentagon on Wednesday to produce a report on climate change and its effects on the military.
The report would list each service's 10 most vulnerable military installations at risk of flooding, sea level rise and wildfires or other threats associated with climate change.
The amendment's language quoted Secretary of Defense James Mattis as saying, ""I agree that the effects of a changing climate - such as increased maritime access to the Arctic, rising sea levels, desertification, among others - impact our security situation.""
In recent years, President Donald Trump had expressed skepticism about whether climate change is real, sometimes calling it a hoax. But since becoming president, he has not offered an opinion.
The House Armed Services Committee adopted the measure brought by Representative Jim Langevin, a Democrat.
The defense policy bill has yet to be considered by the full House.

"Ban on laptops in airplane cabins lifted, U.S. officials say","CBS/APJuly 20, 2017, 10:05 PM
Ban on laptops in airplane cabins lifted, federal officials say
DALLAS -- The ban on laptops in the cabins of planes flying from the Middle East to the U.S. is over, federal officials said Thursday as large airports in the region have taken other steps to increase security.
Those measures include checking electronic devices to make sure they don't contain a bomb, and pulling more people out of airport lines for additional screening.
A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said Thursday that all airlines and airports with flights departing for the U.S. had met the agency's first phase of new security measures, which were announced in late June but not described in any detail.
No airlines are under restrictions for large personal electronic devices anywhere in the world because each has implemented additional security measures that ultimately make the global aviation community more secure, CBS News transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave reports.
Officials released a statement to CBS News saying communication between the DHS and Transportation Security Agency led to the increase in airline safety.
""The quick and decisive action taken by airlines, nations, and stakeholders are a testament to our shared commitment to raising the bar on global aviation security. Airlines were able to implement the necessary enhanced security measures because of the close coordination and extensive communication between aviation partners and DHS/TSA,"" the statement read. ""As we continue to secure global aviation in the coming weeks and months, this communication and partnership between the private sector and the U.S. government will be imperative.""
In March, the U.S. imposed a ban on laptops in the cabins of planes coming into the country from 10 Middle Eastern airports. This week, King Khalid International Airport in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, was the last of the 10 to comply with U.S. security measures and exit the laptop-ban list.
Electronics ban on U.S.-Saudi Arabia flights lifted

Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said the laptop ban was a ""pause,"" a stopgap measure until airports could make other security improvements. It grew from fear that terrorists were working on bombs that can be hidden in devices such as laptop and tablet computers.
""We tested it on a real airplane on the ground, pressurized (as an airliner is during flight), and to say the least it destroyed the airplane,"" Kelly said Wednesday at a security conference in Colorado. He added that intelligence reports indicated terrorists lacked the ability to detonate such a bomb remotely -- meaning they couldn't trigger a bomb in the cargo hold while sitting in the cabin.
Some safety experts cautioned, however, that putting devices with lithium ion batteries that are prone to overheating in cargo increased the risk of fire.

U.S. officials are growing increasingly concerned about the capabilities of terrorist organizations to target commercial planes. One source tells...
Now the Federal Aviation Administration is telling airlines that that devices with lithium batteries should be put in carry-on baggage and not placed in checked luggage -- the advice that existed before the March order covering large electronics devices in the cabin.
Kelly said most of the new security measures will not be visible to passengers. He said, however, that there will be additional testing of devices -- to make sure they are working computers and not a disguised bomb -- and more people will be pulled aside for extra screening. He did not say how agents will decide who gets pulled aside.

Obama Pulled Russian Strings To Smear Trump – New Evidence Rocks Washington,"The controversy over alleged misconduct regarding connections between the Trump campaign and Russian interests has only gotten more convoluted.
Now, there are so many unsubstantiated statements and so many potential characters, it’ll soon reach critical mass and NOBODY will be able to comprehend it.
To put it another way, the case that has consisted of unproven allegations and the purported involvement of numerous actors, both American and Russian, is likely to have contained irregularities committed by various persons.
But there’s still zero evidence that President Trump, his son, or his campaign staff were the ones who did anything wrong.
The latest twist in this convoluted mess involves the highly questionable approval by the Obama Department of Justice of a request to allow a Russian lawyer into the US before she met with members of the Trump campaign.
It begs the question: Why would Obama’s DOJ do this?
Well, the answer might be that Leftists had been planning this Trump/Russia farce for a very long time.
“The Russian lawyer who penetrated Donald Trump’s inner circle was initially cleared into the United States by the Justice Department under ‘extraordinary circumstances’ before she embarked on a lobbying campaign last year that ensnared the president’s eldest son, members of Congress, journalists and State Department officials, according to court and Justice Department documents and interviews.
This revelation means it was the Obama Justice Department that enabled the newest and most intriguing figure in the Russia-Trump investigation to enter the country without a visa.
Later, a series of events between an intermediary for the attorney and the Trump campaign ultimately led to the controversy surrounding Donald Trump Jr.”
We should never suspect that these “extraordinary circumstances” might be part of a political set-up designed to entrap Trump officials, should we?
But it turns out that this Russian attorney was involved in lobbying activities:
“She also engaged in a pro-Russia lobbying campaign and attended an event at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., where Russian supporters showed a movie that challenged the underpinnings of the U.S. human rights law known as the Magnitsky Act, which Russian President Vladimir Putin has reviled and tried to reverse.

Two Trump LEAKS Are FINALLY CAUGHT! They Are….,"June 26, 2017 by Thomas Rhett
The liberals who have been spilling data to the press as far back as President Trump took office have at last been gotten. Trumps Administration has been sitting tight during the current day throughout recent months and it is great that something has at last been done about it.
This is incredible stuff from the Conservative Tribune:
With practically consistently that passes, it appears the organization of President Donald Trump gets hit with another, media-created contention, and one preservationist Washington veteran says he knows why — and that the Trump White House knows who is mindful.
Joseph diGenova, previous U.S. lawyer for the District of Columbia amid the Reagan organization, told the traditionalist site Lifezette that CIA authorities know who is behind the breaks of arranged data to The New York Times and The Washington Post and other media.
Moreover, those authorities have purportedly passed the names of those behind the holes to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has been made up for lost time in the outrage fabricating machine himself.
The Trump organization has been doing combating contention for an extensive piece of its term hitherto, yet the genuine battle, says diGenova, is not in these outrages, but rather with government representatives faithful to previous President Barack Obama and their eagerness to mock their duties to take after factional lines.
The CIA has not yet discharged the names of the general population that they allegedly have recognized, however in the event that they truly have the witnesses, they likely will soon.",Proud Leader,1

France launches 'tick alert app' in frantic bid to map Lyme disease explosion as blight 'moves North',"Lyme disease is spread by ticksCredit:Scott Camazine/Alamy
17 July 2017 • 6:54pm
France has launched a special smartphone application to track a rocketing plague of ticks, which cause over 30,000 cases of Lyme disease par year and pose a threat to thousands of British holidaymakers who take to the French countryside in summer.
Lyme disease attacks the nervous system. If left untreated it can lead to heart problems, temporary facial paralysis, seizures or even death. Symptoms can include a bull’s eye red shaped rash, tiredness, muscle pain and headaches. It is transmitted by ticks when they suck human blood.
Faced with a dramatic surge in the number of cases, which have tripled in the past decade, experts at the French Institute for Agricultural Research, INRA, have launched an application called Signalement TIQUES - French for ""tick alert"".
Une nouvelle application pour lutter contre les tiqueshttps://t.co/QzIpqB7r2T pic.twitter.com/Bva4E2dRts
— BFMTV (@BFMTV) July 17, 2017
Its aim is to enable people to pinpoint where they were bitten by one of the tiny blood-sucking acarids, and to send photos of the specimen.
Describing Lyme's disease as a ""major health issue"", the application called on ""volunteers to get involved in ongoing research"" on the little-known disease.
Despite the risks to foreign tourists, the application is currently only available in French.
INRA has promised to finalise an English-language version ""for British tourists"" in September.
Users input the location, date, their age and whether the victim is human or animal (cat or dog), as well as how many bugs are involved. The idea is to build up a tick map of France.
""Together, we can swiftly improve our knowledge, simply by exchanging knowledge in a spirit of participatory science,"" says the application.
Lyme Disease is carried by infected ticksCredit:The Science Picture Company/Alamy
Researchers even urge people bitten to send the bugs in the post attached to a piece of sticky tape so they can track which species are infesting which areas.
""We're calling on citizens because we don't have thousands of students to send into the forest!,"" said Jean-François Cosson, who is coordinating the project. ""And we need to know exactly where and when people are bitten, as well as studying the varieties of ticks.""
""By crossing weather data with the creature's habitat, we can build up a mathematical forecast model of the risks of coming across a tick,"" he said.
For now, the bugs rarely attack in the colder months, but he warned that warmer, wetter weather caused by global warming meant that they can strike ""even in mid-winter"".
""They will be a growing probably in the UK because of the milder climate,"" he told the Telegraph. The most common Lyme disease-carrying species, ixodes ricinus, or the castor bean tick, is now ""increasingly widespread in Scotland,"" he added.
Last year, French authorities warned British tourists heading for the French countryside to avoid Lyme-disease carrying chipmunks.
Chipmunks have been blamed for causing a 'hidden epidemic'Credit: Juniors Bildarchiv /Alamy
Having briefly been popular as domestic pets after a 2007 Hollywood film, many rodents were released in European woodland and are now being blamed for spreading the debilitating illness to humans.
Campers, hikers and picnickers planning trips to the wooded areas were urged to show caution as one of France’s leading newspapers accused its government of turning a blind eye to the “hidden epidemic”.
If bitten by a tick, Inra experts advise people not to soak them in alcohol, as this stresses the animal and could cause it to regurgitate bacteria into the blood system. The best way is to corkscrew them off with a special tic remover, available in most chemists.
If the tick has been attached for more than 36 hours, one should seek medical help, which could mean taking antibiotics.

The French health ministry is also due to launch a summer media campaign to raise awareness of the risks of the disease. It has released thousands of pamphlets and erected written warnings in wooded areas, but only in French.
France is due to announce protocol for diagnosing and treating Lyme disease this autumn.
While health authorities put the number of new cases each year in France at 33,000, victims' groups say the number could be three times higher, because many people fail to recognise the symptoms.
Britain is officially far less affected, but in recent years the prevalence of the tick-borne disease has risen sharply, with around 2,000 to 3,000 new cases in England and Wales in 2015. Some charities claim the actual number could be as high as 45,000, fuelled by a soaring deer population.

Last year, ministers ordered a major review of its diagnosis.
The disease has gained a higher profile recently after a string of public figures admitted they had been sufferers. Musician Kris Kristofferson revealed last year that he had suffered memory loss because of the illness, which was first misdiagnosed as Alzheimer’s.
Avril Lavigne, the Canadian singer, broke down in tears as she discussed how it affected her in 2015.
Others who have had Lyme disease include George W. Bush, the former US president, and actors Ben Stiller and Alec Baldwin, who said: “At the same time of the year, I get really tired.” Rocker Daryl Hall said it “can make you want to die if you’re not dead”.
Sopranos actress Jamie Lynn Sigler said it had paralysed her, but she had overcome it with antibiotics.

"As fight continues, GOP senator calls McConne","In this June 27, 2017, photo Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., tells reporters he is delaying a vote on the Republican health care bill while...
 ll’s health bill ‘dead’
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had a plan. He and his aides would write a bill in secret, rally GOP senators behind it, and then hold a vote before Congress broke for the 4th of July. That gambit failed spectacularly.
Which led McConnell to pursue Plan B. He’d make some changes to his bill, build a partisan consensus, shore up GOP support over the holiday recess, and then pass it this week. That, too, hasn’t worked out well.
Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) told Fox News yesterday that the legislation McConnell drafted “clearly … is dead” – a point bolstered by Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), who suggested on Friday night that the Senate Republicans’ proposal no longer exists.
As Politico put it, “It was a grim week for the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare.”
The few GOP senators who hosted town hall meetings over the Fourth of July recess were hammered by constituents for trying to undo the health care law. Reliable conservatives like Sens. Jerry Moran and John Hoeven outlined their opposition to the current version of the Senate repeal bill. Even Majority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged at a luncheon back home in Kentucky that the effort might fail.
Buffeted by headwinds, Republicans will return to Washington on July 10 facing even longer odds for piecing together a bill that can win over skeptical moderates and conservatives in the three weeks before the August recess…. [C]orralling 50 votes looks even more challenging after the holiday. The time away from Washington seemed to embolden uncommitted moderates, who are worried about the political and policy implications of repealing the Affordable Care Act.
Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), taking aim at one of the key policy goals of her party leaders, added, “I only see it through the lens of a vulnerable population who needs help, who I care about very deeply. So that gives me strength. If I have to be that one person, I will be it.”
Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) told some of his constituents the other day, “I don’t even know if we’re going to get a bill up.” Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) made similar comments on CBS’s “Face the Nation” yesterday.
Health care advocates have reason to feel some increased optimism – the likelihood of Senate Republicans passing a regressive bill is worse now than before lawmakers left town 10 days ago – but to assume the fight is over would be a mistake.
The Washington Post reported that there’s still an “urgent blitz” on the way.
Aware that the next 14 days probably represent their last chance to salvage their flagging endeavor, President Trump, Vice President Pence and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) intend to single out individual senators and escalate a broad defense of the evolving proposal, according to Republicans familiar with their plans.
When Trump returns from Europe, he plans to counter the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s analysis of the legislation – which shows that 22 million fewer people would have insurance coverage by 2026 than under the current law – with figures and analyses from conservative groups and Republicans that show more benefits and less disruption, should the bill pass, according to a White House official familiar with the strategy.
Of course, if GOP officials are re-writing the bill, quickly coming up with phony data to compete with the Congressional Budget Office’s figures might be tricky. For that matter, whether on-the-fence senators would take seriously “figures and analyses from conservative groups” is unclear.
Complicating matters, there’s growing pressure on Republicans – who have only three weeks of legislating before their lengthy summer break begins - to tackle other, potentially easier, issues.
Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of the GOP leadership, told the Washington Post the caucus will soon have to decide whether the health care initiative is viable. “This does not get better over time,” the Missouri Republican said, “and we’re losing valuable time to get other things that we need to do as well.”
If all else fails, McConnell has admitted he’s open to a bipartisan ACA fix – though the Republican leader clearly sees such an approach as a last resort.

NYC jail inmate caught 7-plus hours after Rikers escape,"The scene at New York City's Rikers Island jail July 26, 2017 after an inmate escape
NEW YORK -- Authorities say an inmate who escaped from a section of New York City's Rikers Island jail complex has been found on the island.
Local media outlets report that Naquan Hill was captured around 3 a.m. Thursday after multiple law enforcement agencies launched a massive manhunt when he was reported missing Wednesday night.
The jail was placed on lockdown as the NYPD, Port Authority police and correction officers searched the island and surrounding waters. Officials say two Department of Correction staffers found him still on the island.
Hill, 24, was one of six inmates in a recreation yard when around 7:30 p.m. Wednesday it's believed that he was able to make his way over a fence while guards were distracted, reports CBS New York. He had been jailed for burglary, the station reports.
Rikers Island is New York City's largest jail. The city's jail system has been plagued for years by a culture of violence and corruption.

The Left always needs a ‘wedge’ issue to divide us. An ‘oppressed’ group to whose defense they can ride as the knight in shining armor.

Unexpected Result In House Vote On Military Funding Transgender Surgery
The Government was expected to foot the bill for gender reassignment surgery and not just the therapy costs, which were already covered. (As you can guess, it isn’t cheap.)

That ‘win’ was short-lived.

Writing a blank check to an unknown number of recipients with an offer of medical treatment that is not affordable to the ordinary person actually incentivizes systemic abuse. This is not anything like an influx of people who are joining the military for a free college education (which has long been considered a reasonable concession).
What, was the VA not overburdened enough already, that they had to invite an unknown number of people to seek out ‘free’ medical treatment through the military?
The President consulted with the Generals. And this was the response they came up with.
If their service comes with the ‘strings attached’ of obligating the taxpayer to pay for reassignment surgery with — at best, ‘controversial‘ outcomes — then their military service will not be required or desired.
There are any number of other medical conditions that will disqualify someone for service.
The ‘victory’ that Transgender advocates thought they had just won forced their hand to this.
There’s going to be a sh-t storm over this for sure.
Did Trump and the Generals make the right call?

60 Children Dead As Killer Nurse Enters The Spotlight,"Posted by Mark Megahan | Jun 23, 2017 | American Strength
Jones wanted the babies to “suffer distress” so she could save them and appear a hero.
Genene Jones was convicted in 1984 for killing one child and suspected of poisoning up to 60 more infants. Under a state law to reduce overcrowding in prisons, the former Texas nurse was slated for automatic release next year.
District Attorney Nico La Hood calls Jones, “pure evil” and says, “justice warrants that she be held accountable for the crimes she committed.” There is no statute of limitations for murder. So to prevent Jones’ release a task force was created to look into some of the murders that did not go to trial. Prosecutors are hoping for a fresh conviction which would prevent the automatic parole.
The new charges involve a 2 year old named Rosemary Vega who died in 1981. The Baxter County Prosecutor announced Jones was indicted this week by a grand jury following a separate indictment last month for the death of 11 month old Joshua Sawyer, also in 1981. “Our Office will attempt to account for every child whose life was stolen by the actions of Jones. Our only focus is justice.” Bond of one million dollars was recommended by the grand jury to keep her solidly behind bars as the new trial works its way through the court system. Before the deadline for her compulsory release, Jones will be moved back to Bexar County to stand trial.
During the 1970’s Jones worked as a licensed vocational nurse at various pediatric clinics. In 1982, she was convicted of killing Chelsea McClellan, a 15 month old baby. The same case charged her for the attempted murder of 18 month old Rolando Jones. Evidence was presented that both infants had been injected with Dilantin, which is an anti-seizure drug. Some believe that Stephen King’s “Misery” was based on her story.
In her earlier trial, evidence was shown that six children had seizures for no apparent reason while under Jones’ care. According to investigators, she wanted the babies to “suffer distress” so she could save them and appear a hero. Even though there was an unusually high number of deaths at the places Jones worked, additional charges were not filed at the time. She denied doing anything wrong but the jury didn’t believe her.
Too many of the ICU’s babies were dying. Of things that should not be fatal. On one shift. Under the care of one nurse.
One October morning in 1981, Pat Belko, head nurse of San Antonio’s Bexar County Hospital pediatric ICU, was given some very disturbing news. One of the facilities RN’s walked into her office at the end of a night shift to tell her many of the ICU’s babies were dying. Of things that should not be fatal. On one shift. Under the care of one nurse, Genene Jones.
Belko had heard the rumors but rather than look into it, scolded the staff for vicious gossip. The RN, Suzanna Maldonado did look into it. When she saw the numbers, she told her boss the ICU’s “census book,” which lists the patients and charts their condition while there, “looks bad.” After checking the log herself, Belko conferred with the unit’s medical director, Dr. James L. Robotham. Together, they agreed an investigation was totally necessary.
Bexar County Hospital started an internal investigation to see if one of their nurses might be killing kids but nothing was done to prevent more from dying. Babies who had been stable stopped breathing suddenly, irregular heartbeat, seizures and other strange problems continued, always on the same shift. The unusual occurrences would happen only when Jones was on duty. Employees began calling it the Death Shift and still nothing was done.
When the investigation report came back two months later, it indicated 10 of the ICU’s patients had died following “sudden and unexplained” complications. Jones was hands on with all 10 at the time they died. The first death that investigators found unusual was Christopher James Hogeda. A very sick 15 month old, he had been in the hospital almost six months with “a severe congenital heart defect, pneumonia, and diarrhea.” He then developed hepatitis causing infection to spread through his system. He died of a cardiac arrest after developing irregular heartbeat. Nine more babies would die in 1981 in Jones’ care.
The report concluded “This association of Nurse Jones with the deaths of the ten children could be coincidental. However, negligence or wrongdoing cannot be excluded.”
By the time the report was finished, Jones was already gone. Without solid convincing proof, the hospital was afraid to fire her, fearing a lawsuit. They also were afraid to tell police or other officials. Instead, they made it a policy to require RN degrees for all nurses which excluded Jones who only held an LVN. As soon as she was gone, the “unexplained events” ceased.
Jones moved on to work for Dr. Kathleen Holland, a pediatrician. In a one month period, seven of Holland’s patients had medical emergencies while attended by Jones. One of these, Chelsea Ann McClellan, didn’t make it. ” Jones is currently serving a 99 year sentence for the murder but unless convicted of an additional murder, will be released to reduce prison overcrowding next year.",Conservative Daily Post,1
Restaurant diners can’t believe their eyes when rats ‘fall from the ceiling’,"July 20, 2017 | Frieda Powers | Print Article
Customers fled a Chipotle Mexican Grill in Dallas when it appeared rats began to rain down on them from the ceiling.
Diners caught video and photos of the unwanted rodents which they claimed fell from the ceiling on Tuesday. The rodents were crawling on the floor and climbing up the wall of the chain’s West End location.
“If we would have been sitting at the table next to that it definitely would have fell on top of our food because it was literally right there,” Daniela Ornelas told NBC DFW. “I just kept wondering what it was, and I kept looking around until I looked at the floor, and I saw three rats, and I ran.”

“This is an extremely isolated and rare incident and certainly not anything we’d ever want our customers to encounter,” a Chipotle spokesperson said in a statement Wednesday.
“We learned yesterday that mice got into a restaurant,” the statement read, “and we immediately contacted professionals who identified a small structural gap in the building as the likely access point. We’re having it repaired. Additionally, we reached out to the customer to make things right.”
But making it right may be a long shot for many, like Ornelas, who said they would not be returning to the location.
The incident was another blow to the restaurant chain that on the same day admitted about a dozen diners at a Sterling, Va., location had come down with norovirus because of a sick employee or customer, according to the New York Post.
The news shook customers and sent Chipotle stock tumbling as thoughts returned to the 2015 wave of norovirus and E. coli outbreaks across nine states in the restaurant’s locations.
While the raining rats incident in Dallas may be “isolated and rare for Chipotle, social media reaction was horrified, as expected.

Bernie RISES again and what he’s planning now is JAW-DROPPING,"You know, Vermont’s democratic socialist Senator, Bernie Sanders, reminds me of Christopher Lloyd’s character in the “Back to the Future” movie series. Y’all remember the mad professor who was over-the-top emphatic? Yeah, that guy. Let’s be very honest, we all have a kinda nutty Uncle Bernie or Aunt Bernice in our families, but who would ever think they would be a U.S. Senator and heck, even run for president? Here’s a fella who actually didn’t have his first paying job until way late in life. Some would call that “failure to launch,” but Senator Sanders did find a way to make money and survive: he entered into politics. And all of a sudden, this unaccomplished back- bencher with no real legislative accomplishments in, well, how long in the U.S. Senate came darn close to being a presidential nominee, and is now a “leading” voice for the progressive socialist left in America.
You want to see something scary? Watch this.
Bernie RISES again and what he's planning now is JAW-DROPPINGSeattle's ""Fight for Fifteen"" crowd gets very BAD newsBOOM! Here's the economic records Trump has set in just FOUR months
As you know, English political philosopher and the father of classical liberalism, John Locke, wrote of natural rights, those being life, liberty, and property, which Thomas Jefferson rephrased as unalienable rights endowed by the Creator of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Now, ask yourself — and I would love to ask Uncle Bernie — exactly what kind of liberal are you? Or as a matter of fact, ask that of anyone adamantly claiming to be a “liberal” today.
I think they’re woefully confused in that they no longer believe the individual is sovereign and endowed by these basic three rights. We’re not debating with liberals today; they’re progressive socialists, democratic socialists, statists and borderline communists. They don’t embrace the ideal of American individualism; what they advance is a collectivism that subjugates and relegates us all to the whims of government…and what they will grant us. We’re no longer able to “pursue our happiness.” Nope, as Senator Sanders said in this clip from Sunday on “Meet the Press” is that we should be guaranteeing healthcare to everybody. That goes right along with we should be guaranteeing free college education to everybody. Which goes right along with we should be guaranteeing a certain wage to everybody. And that goes hand in hand with we should be guaranteeing misery for everybody.
Sir Winston Churchill said, “Socialism is a philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy, its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery.”
Senator Sanders’ response to a failing Obamcare, which was government interjecting itself into our healthcare, is that, first, the GOP plan is going to kill people. Silly me, I thought we were toning down the rhetoric. So what Bernie Sanders wants is that infamous single-payer, Medicare, for everyone. Yes, Medicare, that program having issues with reimbursable rates so that many doctors are refusing to see Medicare patients. And the progressive socialists of the left despise the Medicare Part D program because it offers seniors a private sector choice…you know, the left hates that word choice, unless it means killing babies.
But, ponder this, Senator Sanders says he wants a full-up, government-run single payer healthcare system in America — you know, we should be guaranteeing this right to everybody, all Americans. Hey Bernie, that sounds a lot like the Veterans Administration Health system where the government said every veteran had a right to quality healthcare. And sir, if you haven’t noticed, veterans were dying on wait lists. Yeah, brilliant idea Senator Sanders. You can’t provide adequate, timely and quality care for less than two percent of the U.S. population but you actually think you can do it for everybody…as a right. Now that certainly sounds like something a nutty Uncle Bernie would say at Thanksgiving. We want a healthcare system that resembles the DMV? Ya just gotta ask, who votes for these people?
Now, here’s the real kicker. If everybody is supposed to get everything free, because everything, as determined and defined by the progressive socialist left, is a right…Hey, stop the press, who said the left could go about making all these rights, but they tell us we don’t have a Second Amendment right? How bizarre.
Anyway, back to the point at hand. If everything is supposed to be free, by right, and it’s guaranteed to be distributed by the government, who pays for it? We all know the government is a self-licking ice cream cone. It doesn’t generate capital; it taxes in order to gather resources. Ol’ Uncle Bernie says we just tax all those one-percenters, you know, working stiffs, who build businesses — oops, forgot, Uncle Barry, the other crazy uncle we DID elect president, said “if you own a business, you didn’t build that.”
So in essence, government, according to progressive socialists, doesn’t recognize the indomitable individual American entrepreneurial spirit. It’s just there to have its resources usurped for the left’s definition of guaranteed rights. So, ask yourself, why work? Why build a business if you know it’s just going to be taxed away from you? Heck, why not just stay home, albeit in a government Section Eight house, and wait for your guaranteed rights to everything for everybody? Until, to paraphrase Lady Margaret Thatcher, you run out of other people’s money.
Yeah, that crap is working REALLY well down there in Venezuela! I’ll stick with a nice hot meal made in my own kitchen, or at a chosen restaurant, instead of grab and go from the local garbage can. Ahh, now I know why the progressive socialist left, like Bernie Sanders, doesn’t want us to have a Second Amendment right. When we get tired of eating out of garbage cans and rise in anger at the government for failing to deliver on their promises of guaranteed everything for everybody, we can only throw rocks…because they’ll be the only ones with guns and bullets.
So, it would appear what Bernie wants isn’t universal healthcare, but universal helplessness and subjugation. Ol’ Bernie really wants subjects, not citizens. I was talking with a good friend up in Petoskey, Michigan who gave what may be the best description of the progressive socialist left. He stated, “the left reminds me of the crazy ol’ cat lady who claims she’s helping all the stray cats, but in the end, she’s really not helping any of them at all.”
And you know something else about the progressive socialist left? They’re some serious hypocrites. Take for example, Uncle Barry deciding to cancel the DC school voucher program back in April 2009. However, Barry Soetoro sent his kids to the prestigious Sidwell Friends School. And Uncle Bernie Sanders, well, somehow, the fella who never held a paying job almost until his forties, now has a beautiful lake home there in Vermont…wonder if there’s a wall around it? And all that talk about free college education? Well, Uncle Bernie’s wife, Aunt Jean, is now under FBI investigation for possible bank fraud going back to when she was a president of Burlington College, which she bankrupted. How appropriate, seeing that the political philosophy of the left is indeed morally bankrupt.
Back in 2012 the left got ticked at me for asserting that the Congressional Progressive Caucus was more communist than anything in their political philosophy. The left didn’t want to debate it, they were just mad someone called them on it. Now, we can no longer hide what is the lucid truth. There’s no such thing as a Democrat Party in America. They’re progressive socialists who redefine rights as they please, and promise to guarantee them, while dismissing the very fundamental rights we do have as Americans. This is what you call a fundamental transformation.
Not on my watch, Uncle Bernie!

BOOM! Here's the economic records Trump has set in just FOUR monthsby Matt Palumbo",Allen B West,1
Learning to Love Perpetual War,"The transformation of the Democratic Party into the perpetual war party – accelerated by the Russia-gate hysteria – is personified by Rep. Barbara Lee who voted against the “war on terror” resolution in 2001, as Norman Solomon explains.
For Americans who oppose perpetual war, no member of Congress has been more admired than Barbara Lee. Ever since she cast the only vote against a blank-check war resolution, three days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Oakland Democrat has earned a reputation for bravely speaking antiwar truth to militarist power.
Rep. Barbara Lee, D-California
But, now, the core wisdom of her eloquent speech on the House floor nearly 16 years ago is under threat — from Lee herself.
When Lee beseeched her colleagues to “think through the implications of our actions today, so that this does not spiral out of control,” she was looking far beyond the politics and passions of that moment on Sept. 14, 2001. Now, in a July 7 tweet, she has stepped away from steadfast support for the necessity of diplomatic initiatives.
Finding alternatives to war must include diplomacy. In the case of the “war on terror” that Lee resisted from the start, what spiraled out of control was endless and boundless war. These days, the escalating tensions with Russia could spiral out of control all the way to nuclear holocaust.
That’s a major reason the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved the symbolic hands of its Doomsday Clock even closer to apocalyptic midnight early this year. The nuclear peril is terribly real, and it’s growing.
For that overarching reason, former Sen. Sam Nunn joined with three seasoned ex-diplomats to co-sign an open letter in late June, urging Presidents Trump and Vladimir Putin to discuss four specific proposals for reducing the dangers of nuclear war. Nunn — drawing on his experience as chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee — knows that top-level talks between the Russian and U.S. governments are crucial to reduce the risk of the world blowing up.
But Lee addressed the Trump-Putin meeting at the G20 summit in a very different way. Right after it was over, she sent out a tweet that denounced the very idea of the two presidents sitting down and talking: “Outraged by President Trump’s 2 hr meeting w/Putin, the man who orchestrated attacks on our democracy. Where do his loyalties lie?”
Yet real diplomacy often requires that leaders we don’t like — at the top of a foreign government and maybe our own — sit down together, talk and negotiate. In the case of the world’s two nuclear-weapons superpowers, that could turn out to mean the difference between coexistence or co-annihilation.
During her historic 2001 speech on the House floor, when she insisted that “some of us must urge the use of restraint,” Lee was refusing to be swept up in the easy and dangerous conformity of the times. She saw that militarized confrontation would be a tragically unwise alternative to diplomacy.
Lee now seems to have cast aside such understanding, at least as far as relations with Russia are concerned. Her constituents, as well as other supporters in California and beyond, should encourage her to return to it.
Certainly, Lee deserves credit for ongoing efforts to repeal the 2001 war authorization. Yet this month she veered way off the peace track by proclaiming that she was “outraged” because Trump and Putin had a meeting.
In the aftermath of 9/11, Rep. Lee offered profound insight and leadership instead of confusion and fear. That’s why the saying “Barbara Lee speaks for me” took hold and lasted. But now we must let her know when she no longer speaks for us.
Norman Solomon is the author of “War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death” (2005). [This article first appeared in San Francisco Chronicle at http://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/When-Barbara-Lee-doesn-t-speak-for-me-11305910.php ]",Consortium News,0

Man arrested in 'pizzagate' incident in DC to be sentenced
A North Carolina man who walked into a District of Columbia pizza restaurant with an assault rifle to investigate internet rumors dubbed ""pizzagate"" is scheduled to be sentenced.
Edgar Maddison Welch is set to be sentenced Thursday at a hearing in federal court in Washington. In a court document filed ahead of the hearing, his attorney asked that he be sentenced to 1½ years in prison. Prosecutors have asked for 4½ years.
Welch acknowledged as part of a guilty plea in March that he entered the Comet Ping Pong restaurant Dec. 4 with an AR-15 assault weapon and a revolver. He said he drove to the restaurant from North Carolina to investigate a conspiracy theory about Democrats harboring child sex slaves there.
No one was injured.

President Trump Has Already Saved Taxpayers More Than $86 Billion,"Home NEWS  
 
Shortly after Donald Trump won the 2016 election, markets started an historic rally. This was mostly due to Trump’s promises of vital economic changes like tax and regulatory reform. And those weren’t empty words. As one of the most successful businessmen in the world, Trump understood exactly what economic climate businesses needed to thrive.
Trump’s inauguration day brought another surge of market optimism, leading to one of the best job growth quarters in a generation.
As expected, liberals tried everything to oppose Tump’s agenda. Thankfully, they failed, as a new study revealed that Trump’s economic policies are already having a huge impact.
The study shows that, during his first three months in the White House, President Trump has saved taxpayers more than $86 billion in regulatory costs.
When detailing this savings, the American Action Forum (AAF) points to several Obama-era regulations that Trump has either rolled back on his own or with the help of Republican lawmakers using the Congressional Review Act (CRA).
In just a short time in office, Trump has been on what some have called a “deregulation binge.” This includes the Education Department’s school accountability standards, the Environmental Protection Agency’s waters of the United States rule and the so-called “blacklisting” rule for government contractors, reports Patriot Hangout.
Since taking office, Trump and Congress have repealed 13 rules with the CRA, that allows lawmakers to overturn recent rules with a simple majority in Congress and send the action to the president for his signature.
This is great news for an economy hampered by eight years of overbearing government, and we know it will just keep getting better. In just a few months, President Trump managed to dismantle a large chunk of Obama-era regulations, resulting in a boom for the economy and taxpayers.

The head of the Senate Judiciary Committee said Thursday that he would call on Donald Trump Jr. to appear before the panel, according to CNN.
Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa plans to send a letter to President Trump's oldest son, who this week confirmed he met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya during the 2016 presidential campaign.
On Tuesday, Trump Jr. tweeted out the email correspondence that led to the meeting, which revealed that he had been promised potentially incriminating information about Hillary Clinton – and he actively sought out that information knowing it would come from the Russian government in support of his father's campaign.
The top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, told CNN she wants Trump Jr. to appear before the panel as early as next week.
CNN's report comes a day after Grassley told reporters he would write a letter to former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort asking him to testify. Grassley said he would subpoena Manafort if necessary as part of the committee's investigation into Russian interference in last year's election.
Manafort, along with Trump son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, were also in the meeting with Veselnitskaya.
Multiple congressional committees and a special counsel are investigating possible collusion between Trump campaign associates and the Russia.
House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday that anybody asked to testify before the Senate should do so.

China Suspends Fuel Sales To North Korea’s Regime (Video),"0 0 45 0
North Korea is already just barely hanging by a thread economically…
Conservative Tribune: As part of President Donald Trump’s plan to deal with the totalitarian state of North Korea, he has been pressuring China to do more to rein them in. The president hasn’t appeared pleased with China’s efforts so far, tweeting last week, “While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!”
Although its motivations are not entirely clear, it appears China is now doing more to stifle the North Korean regime. China’s largest state-owned energy company, China National Petroleum Corp, has stopped fuel sales (mainly gasoline and diesel) to North Korea, according to an exclusive report from Reuters.
CNPC appears to have cut off the fuel shipment out of concern that North Korea could no longer pay for the fuel. It is unclear if this move was also motivated by pressure from the Trump administration. More
Reuters: China National Petroleum Corp has suspended sales of fuel to North Korea over concerns the state-owned oil company won’t get paid, as pressure mounts on Pyongyang to rein in its nuclear and missile programmes, three sources told Reuters.
It’s unclear how long the suspension will last. A prolonged cut would threaten critical supplies of fuel and force North Korea to find alternatives to its main supplier of diesel and gasoline, as scrutiny of China’s close commercial ties with its increasingly isolated neighbour intensifies.
CNPC and the Ministry of Commerce did not respond to requests for comment. North Korea’s embassy in Beijing declined to comment.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang, asked about the sale suspension and whether the Chinese government put pressure on CNPC to make this decision, said: “I do not understand this situation you are talking about” and declined to elaborate.
A source with direct knowledge of the matter said CNPC decided to put fuel sales on hold “over the last month or two” and described it as a “commercial decision”.
“It’s no longer worth the risks,” said the source. Chinese and international banks are stepping up compliance checks on companies dealing with countries on the U.S. sanctions list, such as North Korea, he said.
The North Korean agents who mostly buy the diesel and gasoline have been unable recently to pay for the supplies — CNPC normally requires upfront payments, the source said.
Reuters was unable to determine if the agents have started facing credit problems with Chinese and international banks worried about sanctions compliance issues.

July 27, 2017 8:00 AM
Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback is preparing to leave Kansas for a new job in the Trump administration, but his new title has many Kansans scratching their heads: What is the ambassador-at-large for religious freedom?
This isn’t an overseas posting. The ambassadorship is based at the State Department in Washington, D.C.
Brownback will oversee a staff of about 25 as the head of an office responsible for publishing an annual report on religious freedom in virtually every country in the world, along with a list of the countries that are the world’s worst abusers.
Brownback also will be able to make policy suggestions and recommendations, such as sanctions against individuals or foreign governments accused of persecuting religious minorities.
He’ll be expected to assist religious and human rights groups, testify before Congress on issues of religious freedom, and meet with foreign government officials to discuss persecution of religious minorities in their countries.
He will report directly to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.
If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Brownback will be the first publicly elected official to hold the ambassadorship, said former Virginia Congressman Frank Wolf, who introduced the bill that created the ambassadorship in 1998.
Previous ambassadors have been religious leaders or heads of nongovernmental organizations, said Wolf, who now serves as a distinguished senior fellow at the 21st Century Wilberforce Initiative, a Christian nonprofit in Washington.
The previous ambassador-at-large for religious freedom was Rabbi David Saperstein, who held the post for about two years under President Barack Obama.
Before that, the post was vacant for a long time, said Nina Shea, a senior fellow at the nonprofit Hudson Institute, where she directs the Center for Religious Freedom.
“It has not had a lot of influence, frankly, because it’s been demoted in a way from the original act in the sense that it did not have direct reporting” to the secretary of state, Shea said. “It became a subset of the human rights bureau.”
Brownback’s appointment could help boost the office’s influence, she said.
“To have someone with stature and political connections in Washington and respect and experience in government and Congress, with political stature in his home state, will bring it more heft,” Shea said.
Legislation passed in December and signed by Obama strengthened the clout of the office by bolstering staff levels and funding.
As a result, Wolf said, Brownback will be taking over an office with “a lot more power and funding and authority.”
He rejected any suggestion that the ambassadorship could be a step down for the governor.
“Oh my goodness no. ... A lot of people wanted this job.”

Ill Parents Desperate For Trump’s Healthcare Repeal Take Shocking Action After McCain Killed It,"As you probably know by now, the Senate was unable to pass the repeal of the socialist health care that former President Obama rammed through while in office. Despite the years of complaining and promising by our representatives in Washington, and after 7 years of time to get their plan just right, when the time came, they screwed the pooch and didn’t get the job done.
This is awful on a financial and economic level because the un-Affordable Care Act is putting a terrible strain on our economy and undue stress on the healthcare system. It’s awful on a long term care level because not only will the best and brightest not work in public hospitals where they may or may not get paid, but the government is going to get to decide who gets the care since they’re footing the bill.And if all of that wasn’t enough, the hard working men and women who pay taxes, previously had insurance and get sick through the natural course of life are being made to pay huge out of pocket costs that they would never have had to pay with private insurance.
It’s gotten so bad that many have gotten desperate enough to take drastic measures. It’s sad to think that something that was billed as “healthcare” could plunge people into such disrepair that they lose all hope, but that was the case with one New York couple who just couldn’t take the bills they would have been leaving behind them, if they’d lived through their health problems at all. This couple decided, immediately after the health care repeal failed, that they couldn’t go on, and made the decision to end their own lives.
“A couple committed suicide by jumping out of a window of a New York City office building together in desperation over their inability to afford health care.
The incident happened early Friday morning in the Murray Hill neighborhood of Manhattan – just a block from the Empire State Building.
A 53-year-old man and a 50-year-old woman jumped out of a ninth-floor window of the 17-story commercial building on the corner of Madison Avenue and 33rd Street around 5:45am.

Their bodies were covered with white sheets once police arrived at the scene, shutting down the entire block to investigate.
The couple left behind suicide notes in a ziploc bag, that also included their IDs. Police have not released their names yet, but a photo obtained by the New York Post shows part of the letter, and it identifies the woman as Patricia. The note was titled ‘We had a wonderful life’.
A law enforcement source who spoke with the Post said the woman’s note said: ‘Our kids are upstairs, please take care of them’.
The man left one behind too, which read: ‘We both have medical issues, we just can’t afford the health care.’
The building that the couple jumped from includes offices for law and advertising firms, therapists offices and commercial space.
No further information on the couple has been released. It’s unclear how many children they left behind.
Perry Kim, 49, a worker at Pure Green, a juice shop on the same block, said that he was outside just after 5:30am this morning when he heard an ‘ahhh’ noise and saw two people fall from the top of the building.
The man appeared to hit his head and the woman had suffered abdominal injuries. They landed face up to the sky.
He said his manager called 911 and police and EMTs were there soon after but the bodies were immediately covered.
Javier Guzman, who works at the shoe repair shop across the street, told DailyMail.com that he had come into work around 6:45am and had seen the couple lying in the street.
He said: ‘I didn’t recognize them but they looked young, in their forties.’
He said he believed they had jumped from the 9th Floor window which remained open.
The couple committed suicide just a few hours after Senate Republicans tried to pass a bill that would repeal Obamacare.
But three members of their own party – including Sen. John McCain – voted against the bill and it failed to pass, keeping the Affordable Care Act in place for now.
Sen. McCain said that he voted against the bill because it was irresponsible to take health care away from millions of Americans without a new plan to replace it.

See THAAD missile hit mid-air target 00:51
(CNN)The United States said it conducted a successful missile defense test in the Pacific Ocean on Sunday amid growing tensions with North Korea.
US forces tested the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in Alaska by launching a ballistic missile over the Pacific Ocean, according to the US military.
The medium-range ballistic missile was detected, tracked and intercepted, it said.
The tests appears to be a show of force two days after North Korea conducted an intercontinental ballistic missile test.
US Missile Defense Agency director Lt. Gen. Sam Greaves said it's part of an effort ""to stay ahead of the evolving threat,"" but did not provide specifics.
""In addition to successfully intercepting the target, the data collected will allow the Missile Defense Agency to enhance the THAAD weapon system,"" he said.
Soldiers used the same procedures they would use in an actual combat scenario, according to the US military. It said this is the 15th such test for the THAAD weapon system.
North Korea tests missile
North Korea said it tested a ballistic missile that can reach all of the United States. Its test of a Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile Friday was its second of the long-range weapon in a month. The first on July 4 showed the missile had the range to reach Alaska.

Washington should regard the launch as a ""grave warning,"" North Korea state media reported.
""The whole US mainland"" is now within reach, state media quoted North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as saying.
The Trump administration has answered Pyongyang's missile tests with displays of US military power, including missile tests of its own.
The US sent two B-1 bombers from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam on Saturday on a 10-hour round trip over the Korean Peninsula. The US Pacific Air Forces described it as a direct response to the North Korean missile test.
The B-1s teamed up with Japanese and South Korean fighter jets to test ""combined capabilities"" during the mission, the US military said in a statement.
""We have a responsibility to our allies and our nation to showcase our unwavering commitment while planning for the worst-case scenario. If called upon, we are ready to respond with rapid, lethal, and overwhelming force at a time and place of our choosing,"" said Gen. Terrence J. O'Shaughnessy, commander of the Pacific Air Forces.
The THAAD system is capable of intercepting ballistic missiles inside or outside the atmosphere. It can shoot down short, medium and intermediate ballistic missiles.
It uses ""hit-to-kill technology where kinetic energy destroys the incoming target,"" the US military says.
Each THAAD system is comprised of five major components: interceptors, launchers, a radar, a fire control unit and support equipment, according to Lockheed Martin, the security and aerospace company that serves as the prime contractor.
Trump pressures China to act
While Washington continues its military pressure, it has also asked China to pressure North Korea economically to cut off its access to foreign currency.
In a series of tweets Saturday night, Trump blasted China for doing ""nothing"" to stop North Korea.
I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet...
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017
...they do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2017
""I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade, yet they do nothing for us with North Korea, just talk. We will no longer allow this to continue. China could easily solve this problem!"" the tweets read.
In a statement released Sunday, US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley placed further blame on China, saying the United States will not seek additional resolutions that don't ""significantly increase"" international pressure on North Korea because it sends ""a message...that the international community is unwilling to seriously challenge [Kim].""
""China must decide whether it is finally willing to take this vital step,"" part of the statement read. ""The time for talk is over. The danger the North Korean regime poses to international peace is now clear to all.""

WASHINGTON — In a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times on Wednesday, President Trump made a number of misleading and false claims, including statements on health insurance, the biography of his deputy attorney general and French history.
He misrepresented how health insurance works.
“You’re 21 years old, you start working and you’re paying $12 a year for insurance, and by the time you’re 70, you get a nice plan,” Mr. Trump said. “Here’s something where you walk up and say, ‘I want my insurance.’”
Mr. Trump’s description aligns with life insurance or Social Security more accurately than health insurance. A 21-year-old who took out a whole life insurance policy, for example, would pay premiums until death, and the amount accumulated over the decades would be paid out to beneficiaries.
A 21-year-old who purchases a health insurance policy is not paying premiums to save up for care 50 years down the line. Rather, the 21-year-old’s premiums help cover the costs of an older person or someone with more expensive medical needs.
Continue reading the main story
Mr. Trump is right that in most situations, a 21-year-old is healthier than a 70-year-old and needs less medical care. But a 21-year-old with a pre-existing condition could have been denied coverage or charged much more before the Affordable Care Act’s passage.

He falsely said the wife of the Japanese prime minister ‘doesn’t speak English,’ not even ‘hello.’
Motoko Rich, The Times’s Tokyo bureau chief, refuted Mr. Trump’s claim. Though Akie Abe, the wife of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, speaks Japanese in many public international appearances, she delivered a 15-minute speech in English in New York three years ago and made a public service announcement on H.I.V./AIDS for MTV in English.
He said news about Russia ‘wasn’t hot’ when his son met with a Russian lawyer in June 2016.
Mr. Trump has a point that the conversation around Russia did not center on potential connections between his campaign and the Kremlin, but discussion of Mr. Trump’s ties to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and Moscow preceded Donald Trump Jr.’s meeting.
Mr. Trump routinely suggested improving relations with Russia during the Republican primary and earned praise from Mr. Putin in December 2015, prompting stories from many news outlets and criticism from political opponents and foreign policy experts.
He said he discussed adoptions with Mr. Putin. That’s a proxy for sanctions.
As The Interpreter column explained in The Times, Russia’s ban on American adoptions of Russian orphans is “practically synonymous” with sanctions on Russian officials. The Magnitsky Act of 2012, named for a young Russian lawyer who died in a Moscow prison after exposing corruption, prohibits Russian officials responsible for human rights abuses from entering the United States and freezes their American assets. The law infuriated Mr. Putin, who retaliated by halting adoptions of Russian children by Americans.
He incorrectly recounted the history of the F.B.I. and falsely said its director ‘really reports directly to the president of the United States.’
Mr. Trump said that the F.B.I. started reporting to the Justice Department “out of courtesy” after President Richard M. Nixon, but that “there was nothing official, there was nothing from Congress” to cement that relationship.

The F.B.I. was founded in 1908 by Attorney General Charles J. Bonaparte to conduct investigations for the Justice Department, according to the bureau’s website, and Congress expanded its jurisdiction through legislation in the next decade. It officially became the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1935.
The director “has answered directly to the attorney general since the 1920s,” according to the F.B.I. website, and the Justice Department has guidelines instructing the bureau to communicate with the White House with the approval of the attorney general or other top officials at the Justice Department. Although the director J. Edgar Hoover had close, arguably unethical relationships with six presidents, his successors have tried to distance themselves from the president, according to Douglas M. Charles, a history professor at Pennsylvania State University.

He described savings from health care and tax cuts as a ‘windfall’ for the middle class. The cuts are generally more beneficial to the wealthy.
The original version of the Senate health care bill would have repealed taxes totaling $700 billion over the next decade, with most of the money lining the pockets of the richest Americans, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.
The latest version retained two taxes from the Affordable Care Act aimed at the wealthy and was “much less regressive,” the center’s Howard Gleckman wrote. While the wealthy would still have seen the largest dollar amount in tax cuts, lower-income households would have gotten a larger cut as a share of after-tax income.
The White House’s tax blueprint — which lacks the details needed for modeling — would provide modest cuts for the middle class, but the rich and businesses have the most to gain.
If it were to contain the elements of Mr. Trump’s campaign pledges, households in the top 1 percent would get an average tax cut of about $270,000, while the middle fifth of Americans would see about $1,900, according to the Tax Policy Center.
He incorrectly said Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, was ‘from Baltimore.’
Mr. Trump suggested that Mr. Rosenstein was from Baltimore and might have Democratic leanings because “there are very few Republicans in Baltimore, if any.” But Mr. Rosenstein grew up in Philadelphia and attended the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump’s alma mater. He was appointed the United States attorney for Maryland, based in Baltimore, in 2005 by President George W. Bush, a Republican.
Mr. Rosenstein lives in Bethesda, Md., a suburb of Washington.
He offered a distorted history of Paris and Napoleon.
Mr. Trump may have been confusing Napoleon Bonaparte with his nephew, Louis Napoleon or Napoleon III, when he claimed that Napoleon “designed Paris.” In 1853, about 30 years after the first Napoleon died, Napoleon III appointed Georges-Eugène Haussmann to carry out his reconstruction project, envisioned to accommodate rapid population growth and to discourage future revolutions, according to the Museum of the City.
“His one problem is he didn’t go to Russia that night because he had extracurricular activities, and they froze to death,” Mr. Trump continued.
While he identified the correct Napoleon, his version of the 18th-century conqueror’s failed attempt to invade Russia is garbled. Napoleon’s 1812 campaign into Russia lasted about six months, not, as Mr. Trump suggested, one night. And the French emperor did take Moscow in September, before withdrawing a month later as food supplies began to dwindle. Of nearly half a million men under his command, only about 6,000 made it back home and the others died in battle or succumbed to disease or the weather.
Asked what Mr. Trump could have meant by “extracurricular activities,” Adam Zamoyski, the author of “Moscow 1812: Napoleon’s Fatal March,” said: “I can’t make head or tail of it. You could argue that all of Napoleon’s activities were ‘extracurricular’! As are Trump’s.”

Four charts that show who loses out if the White House cuts food stamps,"July 17, 2017 8.26pm EDT
About 13 percent of American households have low or very low food security.

About 13 percent of American households have low or very low food security.
The White House has proposed cutting 25 percent of SNAP’s budget – about US$193 billion – over the next decade.
SNAP stands for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, though it’s more widely known by its pre-2008 name, food stamps. This program helps about 44 million people per month buy food. Last year, the government spent $71 billion in total on the program.
SNAP serves the most vulnerable in our society, for whom a little money means a lot. According to the Congressional Budget Office, cuts to SNAP will likely have a major impact on the individuals who were hurt most by the recent recession.
As research from myself and many others shows, food assistance can have far-ranging impacts on a person’s health and well-being.
SNAP serves to dampen the effects of ups and downs of the economy. As a result, enrollment has been quite cyclical.
However, the number of people enrolled in SNAP is generally much lower than the number of people who are eligible. Throughout the program’s history, only about 30 percent of eligible elderly people actually participated in SNAP at any given time (though these rates have been higher recently). The share of individuals participating in SNAP closely follows changes in the share of unemployed.
Enrolling in SNAP carries a stigma and can be quite costly in terms of time and effort for some individuals.
During the Great Recession, however, many states automatically enrolled people in SNAP when they signed up for other safety net programs. Some states waived the work requirements that had been introduced in 1996 or elevated the poverty threshold for eligibility.
As a result, program participation doubled, along with its cost. In 2006, 26.5 million people were enrolled, costing about $33 billion. The U.S. hit a peak 47 million enrolled in 2013, with an $80 billion budget.
Despite the unemployment rate decreasing, both the share of people eligible for SNAP and share of people who are actually on SNAP are still quite high and are not coming down with the declining unemployment. This raises questions and makes the program more of a target for the small federal government conservatives.
There is a lot of misinformation in the media about SNAP. The program is portrayed as disincentivizing work and creating a culture of dependency. SNAP continues to serve children, elderly and the disabled, who constitute about 60 to 70 percent of participants. But, due to declining real wages and increased inequality during and after the Great Recession, SNAP increasingly operates like work support for the working poor. More than 20 percent of SNAP recipients work full-time, are caretakers or participate in a training program.
Today, most states are back to imposing work requirements and restricting eligibility for able-bodied adults. More than 75 percent of SNAP recipients live in a household where someone had a job in the year before or after receiving SNAP.
Most SNAP recipients live in households with very low income. The Federal Poverty Line is about $20,000 per year for a household of three. SNAP benefits boost the average recipient’s income by about 36 percent. This number may look big, but that amount per person on average is only about $125 per month, with maximum amount for the really poor only slightly more than this.
Many eligible individuals also use these programs for a limited period of time. About 30 percent remain in for less than 12 months.
Finally, despite myths about fraud, error rates are low. On average, SNAP overpays recipients only 3 percent of the time and underpays about 1 percent of the time, with very low fraud rates.
As of 2015, about 13.7 percent of U.S. households had low or very low food security. Many did not have enough food and household members could not eat even when very hungry. Thirty percent went without food for a whole day.
This rate of food insecurity is as high as 20 percent in some states.
Low-income, food-insecure adults are more likely to postpone needed medical care or medications, use the emergency department and more become hospitalized.
What’s more, clinical studies show that people who go hungry over the long term are two to three times more likely to report severe blood sugar issues and diabetes-related problems. Not having enough food makes it harder to follow diet rules, which increases emotional stress.
Among pregnant women, food insecurity is associated with high rates of iron deficiency. That, in turn, can affect birth weight and neonatal cognitive development. Insufficient diet during pregnancy can also lead to higher risk of birth defects, and these issues in prenatal phase and at infancy can significantly affect education and labor market outcomes in the long run.
The next 10 years
SNAP has been successful at reducing food insecurity. Research suggests SNAP benefits reduce the likelihood of being food-insecure by roughly 30 percent.
This has far-reaching consequences for everyone, but especially children. Our research shows that kids who are not hungry do better in school, with higher test scores.
Other studies show that children without sufficient food have not only have significantly lower arithmetic scores, but are more likely to have repeated a grade, seen a psychologist or had difficulty getting along with other children. These problems are also more frequent for teenagers who don’t receive sufficient food.
Meanwhile, disadvantaged children who receive food assistance experience long-term improvements in health – including reduced cases of obesity and diabetes – and economic self-sufficiency later in life, compared to similarly disadvantaged children who do not.
When considering the costs and benefits of this program, the calculations should be done with these facts in the balance. Making SNAP less accessible may mean not only major short-term impact to the most vulnerable but also very significant long-run effects.
It is hard perhaps for some to judge the benefits of having one less hungry person. But it is not hard to see the costs of a hungry one. If less hunger means fewer dropouts from school, less emergency room use and less crime, those are big gains for society.

Trump Has Set U.S.-Cuba Relations Back Decades,"President Donald Trump’s new Cuba policy fulfills a campaign pledge he made to conservative Cuban-Americans during last year’s presidential campaign, but it is lousy foreign policy.
“America will expose the crimes of the Castro regime and stand with the Cuban people in their struggle for freedom,” Trump declared during a raucous event in Miami last week. “Effective immediately, I am canceling the last administration’s completely one-sided deal with Cuba.”
The tone of Trump’s speech announcing the new policy was reminiscent of earlier presidents who sought regime change in Havana through economic coercion — a policy in place from 1961 until President Barack Obama’s normalization announcement in December 2014. For decades, the U.S. embargo imposed suffering on the Cuban people by damaging their economy but never came close to achieving its goal of reforming or toppling the Castro government.
Trump’s new policy won’t, either. For one thing, it is a half-measure — a compromise between Cuban-American hard-liners’ demands that he reverse every aspect of Obama’s opening, and the pleas of U.S. businesses that he not shut them out of the Cuban market. Trump is prohibiting individualized people-to-people travel, but leaving intact the general licenses for all other travel categories. He is prohibiting financial transactions with Cuban enterprises managed by the military, but exempting telecommunications, ports, and airports, thereby safeguarding most of the U.S. businesses that have already signed deals with Havana.
None of the other business opportunities opened up by Obama are being foreclosed; diplomatic relations remain intact, and Cuban-American family travel and remittances are untouched. Travelers can still bring back rum and cigars. Asked why the president wasn’t imposing even tougher sanctions, a senior administration official replied, “You can’t put the genie back in the bottle 100 percent.”
No doubt the new rules will reduce the number of non-diaspora U.S. visitors to the island, which totaled 284,937 in 2016 — accounting for just 7 percent of Cuba’s 4.1. million foreign visitors. Many of those U.S. visitors went on trips that would still be allowed under the new rules. This loss of business will not cripple of the Cuban economy or force concessions from the government.
However, by prohibiting individualized people-to-people travel, the new regulations strike an especially hard blow at Cuba’s emerging private sector, composed largely of private restaurants, tour guides, and bed-and-breakfast rentals (casas particulares) patronized by visiting Americans. By contrast, packaged tours operate through the state-run tourist agencies, lodging visitors in state-owned hotels. That is why some of Cuba’s most prominent private entrepreneurs urged Trump not to reverse Obama’s policy.
The stated goal of Trump’s new policy is to force the Cuban government to improve its human rights practices. To that end, the president set out benchmarks for changes that would trigger reduced U.S. sanctions: “We will not lift sanctions on the Cuban regime until all political prisoners are freed, freedoms of assembly and expression are respected, all political parties are legalized, and free and internationally supervised elections are scheduled.”
The Castro regime’s response is predictable because for more than half a century it has consistently taken the same position: Cuba will not bend in the face of U.S. demands and it will never surrender its sovereignty by negotiating about its internal political or economic arrangements.
Moreover, the invocation of human rights is more an excuse than the real reason for Trump’s policy change. The administration has shown no interest in human rights in Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, or the Philippines. On the contrary, the president has gone out of his way to praise and encourage leaders whose human rights records are far worse than Cuba’s. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made clear that “America First” means human rights will take a back seat to U.S. national security and economic interests. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, both perennial critics of Cuba’s human rights record, both warned that rolling back Obama’s policy would hurt the cause of human rights, not help it. The real reason for Trump’s policy change lies elsewhere.
Trump Pays His Debts
By making his announcement in Miami’s Little Havana neighborhood, flanked by Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart (R-Fla.) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Trump signaled that domestic political calculations outweighed foreign-policy interests in his decision. The president has repeatedly insisted that Obama struck a bad deal, but that claim is hard to reconcile with the fast pace of diplomatic progress during the last two years of Obama’s presidency, when the United States and Cuba signed 23 bilateral agreements on issues of mutual interest.
The Trump administration’s own interagency policy review concluded that engagement was effectively advancing U.S. interests in areas from law enforcement to commerce to environmental protection. But in a meeting of the deputy secretaries of all the relevant executive branch agencies, the White House rejected their conclusion and then wrote its own hardline policy in close collaboration with Díaz-Balart and Rubio. “They worked with us hand-in-glove,” said a senior administration official.
Trump decided to tighten the U.S. embargo because he owed a political debt conservative Cuban Americans who supported him for president. At a time when the race in Florida looked close, the veterans’ organization of Bay of Pigs combatants endorsed Trump. In return, he promised to reverse Obama’s policy.
In fact, Cuban-Americans did not vote overwhelmingly for Trump. He won between 50 percent and 54 percent of the Cuban-American vote, slightly better than Mitt Romney in 2012 but still far below the 2-1 margins Republicans racked up before that.
White House officials privately acknowledged that the decision was also driven by Trump’s promises to Díaz-Balart and Rubio in exchange for their support on other issues. Díaz-Balart was reported to have extracted the promise of a tough Cuba policy in exchange for his vote to repeal Obamacare. And Rubio sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia’s covert attempt to swing the 2016 election. After having dinner with Trump on the eve of former FBI Director James Comey’s testimony before the committee, Rubio cross-examined Comey as if he were acting as Trump’s defense counsel. Rubio denied there was any connection.
From climate change to NATO to NAFTA, Trump has shown his contempt for traditional diplomacy by following through on campaign pledges regardless of the damage to U.S. foreign relations. Trump’s political payoff to Miami’s Little Havana runs true to form. His return to insulting rhetoric and imperial demands will throw state-to-state relations with Cuba back into the deep freeze, impeding further progress on issues of mutual interest and stalling negotiations on property claims, human rights, and the return of fugitives. It will be harder, as Cuban officials warned in advance, to enlist Havana’s cooperation on issues ranging from cybercrime to Venezuela.
The new policy of hostility plays into the hands of hard-liners in Havana who share a curious common interest with hard-liners in Miami in opposing warmer U.S.-Cuban relations. Havana’s conservatives can credibly argue that Washington is still the revolution’s implacable enemy, so the risks of political and economic reform are too great to chance. If anything, the regime’s tolerance for dissidents is likely to diminish — just the opposite of Trump’s stated goal.
Faced with a renewed threat from Washington, Havana will do what it did in the 1960s — seek international partners as a counterweight. In recent years, Russia and China have both sought to enhance their influence in Cuba by providing economic assistance. Moscow has gone further, building a “strategic partnership” with Havana involving closer military ties and diplomatic coordination. Russia and China’s growing influence has been a concern of the Pentagon for almost a decade, and it led seven Republican congressmen, three Senate Republicans, and 16 retired senior military officers to implore Trump not to disengage from Cuba, lest he leave the field open to U.S. adversaries.
Finally, the United States will pay a heavy diplomatic price in Latin America, where relations are already strained because of Trump’s incendiary rhetoric about Latino immigrants, the Mexican border wall, and the North American Free Trade Agreement. Latin America was unanimous in its support for Obama’s policy of engagement. By reversing it, Trump has surrendered U.S. leadership in the Western Hemisphere and has put at risk Latin American cooperation on issues vital to the United States like migration, narcotics trafficking, and transnational crime.
Reversing the policy of engagement with Cuba is one more step in Donald Trump’s campaign to lay waste to Barack Obama’s legacy, regardless of the cost to U.S. foreign-policy interests. Trump can bask in the adulation of the Cuban-American right, but it comes at a high price for Cubans, Americans, and most Cuban-Americans who thought they had put the Cold War in the Caribbean behind them.",Foreign Policy,0

They’re At It Again: Media caught LYING about first lady of Japan Snubbing President Trump at G20 Dinner,"Main Stream Media in 2017 is being known for 1 thing…being fake. As they prepare for next week talking points an article came out from THE HILL stating that Akie Abe First Lady of Japan Snubbed President Trump by acting as if she did speak a word of English at a G20 Dinner earlier this month when in fact she does according to THE HILL!
The Hill Later changes the title to this
Other Fake News Media sites didn’t bother to update the Title or the story even though its now being Reported by the Washington Post that its False.
So what does the Fake News Media Credit their false narratives that First lady of Japan Snubbed president trump by Pretending she doesn’t speak English
A Video of Here giving a Speech at a Ford Foundation seminar in September 2014 in plain English
In the video, it is clearly seen that she is reading off a prepared and rehearsed speech like an artist signing a song in a different language other than its own.
but the Main Stream Media ran with it until The Washington Post posted an Article titled
In the Article, it states that President Donald Trump told NYT reporters that Mrs. Abe didn’t know a word of English not even “hello” according to the People at the POST “That is ridiculous”
Here is the Read out of the Interaction Between President Donald Trump and The New York Times regarding the matter:
TRUMP: So, I was seated next to the wife of Prime Minister Abe, who I think is a terrific guy, and she’s a terrific woman but doesn’t speak English.
HABERMAN: Like, nothing, right? Like zero?
TRUMP: Like, not “hello.”
HABERMAN: That must make for an awkward seating.
TRUMP: Well, it’s hard, because you know, you’re sitting there for—
TRUMP: So the dinner was probably an hour and 45 minutes.
So does the First Lady of Japan Know English?
The Answer is Yes but Very little she is known to be Extremely polite and I am sure that she preferred to use an Interpreter when Speaking to the First Family as a Sign of Respect and understanding.
So again this is a sign that the Main Stream Media will do anything, push anything and Manufacture any Narrative to try to discredit or make the President look bad.

BREAKING: Trump Kicks Reince Priebus Out Of White House (TWEET),"GooglePinterestDiggLinkedin Reddit Stumbleupon PrintDeliciousPocketTumblr
Donald Trump’s White House has been going through a lot of insane changes lately, and it is certainly looking like a sign of an inevitable implosion.
Subscribe to our Youtube Channel
It was just a few days ago that White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer resigned over Trump’s hiring of Anthony Scaramucci as his new Communications Director. Now, another key player in Trump’s administration is out thanks to “the Mooch” – White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Trump announced this shocking change in staff over Twitter, remarking that retired four-star general and Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kennedy would be taking Priebus’ place:
We might have seen this coming – yesterday, Scaramucci told the New Yorker that Priebus was a “f*cking paranoid schizophrenic” and made several other vulgar comments about the former Republican National Committee president.
While this story is still developing, these rapid changes in staff show an administration that is clearly in trouble and struggling to keep its head above water as it self-destructs. Trump’s staff is being turned over at an unprecedented rate, and the amount of in-fighting between even the top staffers is like nothing we’ve ever seen before. But what else can you expect when you appoint the most vile, corrupt individuals to help you run a country?
If the leaks coming from the White House weren’t concerning enough, the recent changes in staff serve as a telling sign that things are falling apart on a daily basis and Trump is desperate to save his failing presidency. Already, Trump’s new Communication Director Anthony Scaramucci has become one of the most hated, abrasive characters in Trump’s administration and is causing trouble with other staffers. We can only imagine what this administration will look like in the weeks to come – and it’s probably safe to say that recovery will be impossible.

BREAKING: Viral Rant Exposes GOP Racism in The Most Perfect Way – This 1 Is For Obama,"This epic rant about racism from Occupy Democrats fires some tough truths toward the Republican party. It says that Donald Trump won the election due to a “racist hissy fit” and that the GOP hates Obama for one reason: he’s black.
Occupy Democrats was created as a Facebook page by two brothers, Rafael and Omar Rivero, but has now bloomed into a website and several other social media accounts. It frequently produces viral posts and internet memes.
Their goal is to fuel and feed the national conversation, and that’s exactly what they do. Since Occupy Democrats launched in 2012—one month before the election—it has become a frequent national talking point.
With the eyes of the nation upon them, Occupy Democrats has unleashed a tirade about racism. It’s an argument that has been heard before, but it’s one that few on the national stage are eager to have.
The rant reminds us all what the nation looked like in 2009, when Obama assumed office after eight years of George W. Bush and six years of a Republican-majority Congress.
In 2009, America was losing 800,000 jobs per month. The housing market had collapsed, and the auto industry was on the verge of doing the same.
The stock market was falling, and Osama Bin Laden was still alive. Medical bills were the number one cause of personal bankruptcy. And the Republicans had been completely in control for a half-dozen years.
Enter Barack Obama, the man who saved the big banks and the auto industry. The president who gave us health care.
A president who faced opposition and hatred from the GOP the moment he won the election. Republicans like to call him the “worst president ever.”
In the rant, Occupy Democrats points out that the GOP lied about the origins of Obama’s birth, a scandal that Donald Trump himself manufactured to get attention from the press.
They point out that Republicans frequently lied about Obama’s religion and fanned fears about Sharia law by offering lies and misinformation to the public.
Occupy Democrats think the Republicans hate Obama solely because he is black, and opinion that many have expressed. However, not too many are comfortable talking about race on the national stage—and few are willing to express their opinion on it as bluntly at Occupy Democrats.
Obama relaxed gun policies, authorized offshore drilling practices and took an extremely middle-of-the-road approach on a number of issues that didn’t endear him to Democrats—but Republicans didn’t like the look of their own policies on him, either.
The rant from Occupy Democrats accuses the GOP of being the party to “play the race card,” because that’s what they did for eight years of Barack Obama.
Now, Donald Trump is in the Oval Office because of a racist revenge reaction—according to the rant.

President Donald Trump’s controversial travel ban can take effect in part, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday, and the Court will hear oral arguments on the executive order in October.
The Court agreed to hear the appeal on the travel ban after two federal courts recently ruled it was unconstitutional. The government can now enforce the travel ban “with regard to people who don’t have a relationship to the United States, but not with regard to the named challengers or people like them – for example, who have relatives who want to come,” according to SCOTUSblog.
SCOTUS lifts injunction against travel ban, except with respect to individuals with bona dude relationship to the US
— SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2017
“Denying entry to such a foreign national does not burden any American party by reason of that party’s relationship with the foreign national. And the courts below did not conclude that exclusion in such circumstances would impose any legally relevant hardship on the foreign national himself,” the Court wrote. “So whatever burdens may result from enforcement of (the ban) against a foreign national who lacks any connection to this country, they are, at a minimum, a good deal less concrete than the hardships identified by the courts below.”

The checks and balances of executive orders
Executive orders are as old as George Washington. Every president except William Henry Harrison has issued them, and some—like President Donald Trump's recent executive order on immigration—are controversial. They directly affect how the government operates but it is not always clear how they work.
Nicole L. Cvetnic and Natalie FertigMcClatchy
Trump said last week that the ban would take effect 72 hours after being cleared by courts. He said in a statement Monday that the Court’s decision was a “clear victory for our national security.”
“As President, I cannot allow people into our country who want to do us harm. I want people who can love the United States and all of its citizens, and who will be hardworking and productive,” Trump said. “My number one responsibility as Commander in Chief is to keep the American people safe. Today’s ruling allows me to use an important tool for protecting our Nation’s homeland. I am also particularly gratified that the Supreme Court’s decision was 9-0.”
The travel ban, signed by Trump on March 6, imposed a 90-day pause in travel from citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It is a second, watered-down version of the original travel ban signed by Trump, no longer including Iraq on the list of blocked countries. It also scrapped a loophole for “persecuted religious minorities,” which critics argued was proof that the Trump administration was giving Christians preferential treatment while barring Muslims.
Given the ban has a 90-day limit and could expire before oral arguments occur, it’s possible the case will be moot before it goes before the Court for a permanent decision.
The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Richmond, Virginia, ruled 10-3 in May that the order amounted to unconstitutional religious discrimination. The Trump administration has denied that the ban is being used to target Muslims, but Trump said while campaigning for president that the country needed “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.”
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, based in San Francisco, ruled unanimously in June that the order does not comply with federal immigration law, and Trump “exceeded the scope of the authority delegated to him by Congress.”
Both courts mentioned burdens on U.S. citizens imposed by the travel ban, with one case involving the restricted travel of family members of U.S. citizens and another involving students who had been admitted to U.S. universities. The Supreme Court said that reasoning was legitimate, which is why it provided exceptions for those with a “bona fide” relationship with the U.S. in its lifting of the block imposed by those courts.
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a decision concurring and dissenting in part with the majority, saying he thought the travel ban should be permitted to continue in full, with no exceptions. Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch joined in that opinion. The majority opinion does not list an author or the justices that agreed with it, but the in-part dissent by Thomas was the only one listed on the order.
The Associated Press contributed to this report.

US Fed sees slight to moderate growth in June,"The Fed’s regional banks said their contacts reported a growth at a pace “ranging from slight to moderate,” while most expected “modest to moderate gains” in the coming months, according to the report, which policymakers will review before their next meeting on interest rates July 25-26. (Reuters)
The US economy saw “slight to moderate” growth in June while signs of mounting inflation remained scarce despite tight labor markets, the Federal Reserve said today. Most regions also expect the middling expansion to continue in the coming months, but businesses said they continue to feel pressure to offer higher pay and benefits to attract qualified workers, according to the Fed’s report on economic conditions. The so-called beige book, which surveys anecdotal reports in the 12 Federal Reserve districts, came as Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers on Wednesday the central bank still expects to implement only “gradual” interest rate increases over a period of years to support continued growth.
The Fed’s regional banks said their contacts reported a growth at a pace “ranging from slight to moderate,” while most expected “modest to moderate gains” in the coming months, according to the report, which policymakers will review before their next meeting on interest rates July 25-26.
Falling auto sales were a cause for concern, helping soften consumer spending in many parts of the country. Conditions for farmers also were mixed, with some areas experiencing severe drought, according to the report. Signs that inflation could pickup from its current sluggish pace were scant, according to the report. The Fed said prices continued to rise only “modestly” and a few districts reported easing inflation, due in part to cheap fuel.
Despite the absence of upward price pressures, the Fed has twice raised interest rates this year and expects to do so once more — as prices begin to rise after “transitory” factors from early in the year subside. No rate increase is expected this month, however. Fed members have been divided over the threat of inflation and the amount of slack in labor markets, even though unemployment currently sits at only 4.4 per cent.
Federal Reserve banks in San Francisco and St Louis said the scarcity of workers had put upward pressures on wages. According to the St. Louis Fed, “employers reported minimal hiring due to difficulties finding qualified candidates, putting upward pressure on both wages and benefits,” the report said, echoing similar statements in recent editions of the beige book.
But those anecdotal reports contrast with official figures, which showed a monthly increase in average hourly earnings of less than 0.2 per cent in June, below analyst expectations. Disappointing wage growth in recent years has coincided with the slow pace of inflation, which currently sits at 1.4 per cent, with little indication it will rise above the Fed’s two per cent target. Though the report was relatively upbeat, the situation in some districts was less optimistic.
Growth in the Philadelphia region “appeared to slow” to a slight pace, while reports from the Cleveland area were “somewhat less positive” than previously reported.

"The Mass Killing of Civilians, Now in Syria and Iraq, Is Part of a Long Depressing Pattern of American War Making","There was once a time, during the Vietnam War, when this cruel approach mattered to Americans.
July 7, 2017, 10:15 AM GMT
Photo Credit: John Gomez / Shutterstock
A recent New York Times op-ed by Micah Zenko documents a new increase in civilian deaths in Iraq and Syria. The headline asks the question, Why Is the U.S. Killing So Many Civilians in Syria and Iraq?
The answer, which should be obvious, is this: because that’s what the United States military does and always has, that’s why.
There are peace loving nations in the world. The United States is not one of them. It never has been.
The belief that our “freedom” requires the application of violence to others, especially others who are not white, is deeply embedded in the national psyche. The genocidal idea that the best Indian is a dead Indian precedes the Revolution of 1776. The violence required by the slave trade and the enforcement of slavery itself was also established early on.
The founding fairy tale of the United States credits George Washington and others with nobility and heroism in the violent conflict with the British Army. Often ignored is the messy detail that many Indians and black people fought on the side of the British.
The point is that the true military DNA of the nation is rooted in the nonstop business of slaughtering Native Americans, rebellious slaves, Mexicans, Hawaiians, Filipinos, innumerable Latin Americans, Asians, and sometimes even white people deemed to be in the way of our “God ordained” global mission. One requirement throughout has been worship of those who serve in the military.
Another has been indifference to civilian targets. The use of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki is one of the more recent markers in the unbroken history of disregard for civilian life. The US wars on Korea, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos extended the pattern. Again and again the end is deemed sufficient to justify the means. That is not just the culture of the military. It’s the culture of the culture.
Viet Nam Was Different
Unlike any US war before or since, the war on Viet Nam, Laos and Cambodia engendered mass opposition. A cornerstone of the movement was revulsion over civilian casualties. Television reporting is often given credit for raising awareness of the brutality of the war. Doubtless that was true. The Pentagon certainly believes so and it has devoted enormous resources to managing media coverage of US wars differently ever since.
In retrospect, the extent of the civilian slaughter in Viet Nam was actually underreported. HUE 68, a remarkable new book by Mark Bowdin, is spellbinding reading for those too young to have experienced the war and for those who lived during it.
“The man was trying to raise himself. He was on one knee. Lefler emptied his magazine into him. Lefler was shaking like a leaf.
His squad mates hooted their approval.
“You killed that motherfucker,” said one
They congratulated him on his first kill, and they passed along their own approach to fighting in Hue: A gook is a gook. Kill them all.” (Note: the 18-year-old Lefler believed the man was a civilian.)
In that passage and others Bowdin provides a vivid account of the US military mindset throughout the war. His book adds powerful new detail and context to the ugly history that includes the My Lai massacre and many other atrocities in Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos.
“These days in the third week of the battle were the worst. Both sides were bloodied and many of the city’s residents were dead or hurt or in hiding. The marines were using flamethrowers to burn bodies on the street, mostly in an effort to control the stench. Hue had become a city of the dead.
….There were corpses everywhere, twisted and in pieces, in every stage of decay. On the littered city streets they rotted where they had fallen, or where in some places they had been hastily tossed or bulldozed into heaps. Dead dogs, dead cats, dead people. In addition to those in the open there were dead in bunkers and enemy spider holes and under rubble.”
Bowdin is no apologist for the role of the Vietnamese in the slaughter. But in the epilogue and interviews about the book, he clearly makes the point that within the US government, including the military, there was virtually no concern over civilian casualties.
Fifty years ago, the very idea promoted by the Vietnam antiwar movement that civilian lives “matter,” was a complete rupture with what had gone before. That’s why the opposition to the opposition was so emotional. It still is.
Regression to the Mean. Pun Intended.
The effort to recover from the war aversion known as “Vietnam syndrome” has been much discussed elsewhere. Suffice to say that Ronald Reagan’s invasion of Grenada in 1983 and the many wars since have firmly reestablished the legitimacy of permanent war as the American value that supersedes all others.
What comes along with that territory is regression to the mean of obsequiousness to all things military. We are expected to applaud soldiers on airplane flights, thank soldiers for their service, pay tribute to them at sports events and display other forms of worship ad nauseam.
Even so, honoring Vietnam veterans remains an ongoing and specific project.
In 2008 Congress appropriated special funds for the Pentagon to celebrate Vietnam vets through the year 2025. Its dedicated website currently lists nearly 11, 000 partners in its mission. It boasts of organizing nearly 10,000 events toward that end. You have probably seen one or more of them. Perhaps you thought they were authentically “grass roots.”
It’s no surprise that the Pentagon is motivated to honor the military service of those who served in Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos. But other shapers of public opinion are involved too.
The New York Times is running a yearlong Vietnam ’67 series. It is heavy on praise for military vets and very light on antiwar points of view.
Based on preview screenings, op-eds and appearances made by producers Ken Burn and Lynn Novick, it is clear that Vietnam era vet worship will get amped up even more in their forthcoming 18 hour PBS documentary on the war.
Which Side Are You On?
Centuries of white supremacist slaughter and brutality, at home and abroad, have accumulated into a spectrum of shared consciousness that incudes war glorification, indifference, delusion, denial and numbness. What to think about Vietnam war veterans remains an acutely unsettled question.
Personally, I never called a soldier, or a veteran, a baby killer. I never saw anyone else do so either. For one thing, I knew that many were themselves antiwar or might become so.
However, as an early and committed antiwar activist and draft resister, I did chant, HEY, HEY LBJ HOW MANY KIDS DID YOU KILL TODAY countless times during antiwar demonstrations. So did millions of others.
To be sure, most vets got a rough deal during and since the war. For that they deserve sympathy and support.
But still. Can we keep even a tiny measure of perspective about this?
Like the Civil War, the Vietnam war made moral alternatives clear for all to see. During the Civil War you were either for secession or not. Young men and their families had choices to make. The decisions were often painful and divisive.
So too with Viet Nam. Julian Bond, Grace Paley, Benjamin Spock, Alice Herz, Cora Weiss, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Joan Baez, Muhammad Ali, religious leaders of all faiths and millions of others said as loudly as they could that the war was immoral.
And because there was a vigorous and very public draft counseling movement, everyone knew that there were multiple ways to avoid fighting it.
In a nation that like no other extols personal responsibility, let us be clear that those who fought, or supported the fighters, decided to do so. They made a choice.
A good number of them chose to spray twenty million gallons of Agent Orange on Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos. The effects of that alone cause pain and suffering to this day, including to veterans themselves. Collectively, Vietnam veterans killed millions, the majority of whom were civilians, many of whom were in Cambodia and Laos with whom we were not at war. Some participated in flat out massacres, most of which were never reported.
Yes, probably some soldiers were called baby killers back in the day. Why? Because a good number of vets were directly and indirectly involved in killing babies, that’s why. Antiwar activists did not want to pretend otherwise or honor that service.
Oh, and there’s also the question of, for what? The Vietnamese never say they won the war, only that they defended their country. And that nobody won the war. But by any conventional measure, Vietnam veterans, together with their Presidents and generals LOST the war.
Yet for all of this, some veterans and their advocates complain that they are not sufficiently venerated. Some still express hostility toward the anti-war movement and claim that we prevented you from “winning” the war. Others say that in the name of “healing,” those who worked diligently to save you from yourselves and your misleaders now owe you some sort of apology.
Indeed, an especially powerful moment in the upcoming Burns/Novick documentary features a self-described antiwar activist named Nancy Biderman tearfully apologizing for having called soldiers baby killers back in the day.
Has Henry Kissinger apologized?
Is there a “we’re so sorry” from Dow Chemical or Monsanto?
Has the Congress appropriated funds to clean up all of the Agent Orange residue and un exploded ordnance in Viet Nam, Cambodia and Laos?
Is this healing a one-way or a two-way street?
And suppose for a moment we could again value peace as we did 50 years ago—wouldn’t it make sense to worship war and warriors less, instead of more?
But we don’t have a draft, some say, so that can never happen. Not so.

"Russia Threatens To SHOOT Down American Planes, U.S. Military Give UNFORGETTABLE Response","This is not going to get any better until it gets worse it seems. Especially after what is going down as we speak. In response to Russia’s vow that they would shoot down any U.S. aircraft that flies west of the Euphrates in Syria the U.S. says, that we will not hesitate to defend ourselves. No matter what. No hesitation, no second thought, and no regrets. We will defend ourselves.
This promise came after the U.S. forces shot down a plan that belonged to the Syrian regime…you know, satan spawn. There are reports that it was the same plane that ad dropped bombs near U.S. allies.
Now our beef isn’t with anyone else in Syria at the moment other than ISIS and anyone who has anything to do in support of ISIS, and Captain Jeff Davis told Fox News straight up that we will not hesitate to defend ourselves or our partners when and if needed.
‘I’m confident that we are still communicating between our operations center and the Russia federation operations center,’ he said.
‘And I’m also confident that our forces have the capability to take care of themselves.’
Department of Defense spokesman Major Adrian JT Rankine-Galloway additionally vowed that the U.S. military would not be deterred by threats.
He said they would continue conducting ‘operations throughout Syria, targeting ISIS forces and providing air support for Coalition partner forces on the ground.’
‘As a result of recent encounters involving pro-Syrian Regime and Russian forces, we have taken prudent measures to re-position aircraft over Syria so as to continue targeting ISIS forces while ensuring the safety of our aircrew given known threats in the battlespace,’ he said.
The United States and Russia, which has been providing air cover for Syria’s President Bashar Assad since 2015 in his offensive against ISIS, have a standing agreement that should prevent in-the-air incidents involving U.S. and Russian jets engaged in operations over Syria.
The Russian defense ministry said it viewed the incident as Washington’s “deliberate failure to make good on its commitments” under the de-confliction deal.’
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, in comments to Russian news agencies, compared the downing to “helping the terrorists that the U.S. is fighting against.”
“What is this, if not an act of aggression,” he asked.
Meanwhile, the U.S.-backed opposition fighters said Assad’s forces have been attacking their positions in the northern province of Raqqa and warned that if such attacks continue, the fighters will take action.
“Would just tell you that we’ll work diplomatically and militarily in the coming hours to establish deconfliction,” Dunford said.
Let me see if I have this right.We are fighting ISIS..Russia is fighting ISIS….Syria is fighting ISIS…..Iran is fighting ISIS.Best to ask who isn’t fighting ISIS? BTW Putin’s response to Our shooting down the SU-22.kinda tells me there is no love lost between Trump and Putin! Kinda trashes the Liberal narrative of a Putin/Trump connection to the past election?
Message to Putin, Assad, Iran and North Korea….we now have a……… LEADER…………….in the White House……obama is gone!………….get use to it!

ABSURD: San Francisco metro officials HIDE CRIME video to avoid ‘racial animosity’,"Jul. 12, 2017 6:35 pm by SooperMexican • No Comments
I dislike when conservatives simply assume things to fit our political agenda rather than have hard evidence for them, but in this case the San Francisco public metro officials are blatantly confirming what we all suspect.
They’re hiding details of crime because it would stir up racial animosity.
A top BART official opened the door for a fresh round of criticism Monday when she explained the transit agency’s decision to withhold information about criminal misconduct on the system by pointing at what she called the media’s “disproportionate elevation” of crimes that “unfairly affect and characterize riders of color.”
Two BART board members took issue with Assistant General Manager Kerry Hamill’s reasoning, which they said went on unnecessary tangents and further clouded the transit agency’s commitment to transparency.
In a July 7 memo to BART’s board of directors obtained by The Chronicle, Hamill referred to the latest crime on BART that attracted widespread attention: the snatching of a woman’s cell phone about a week earlier by a group of at least 10 juveniles at Coliseum Station.
Although only a cell phone was stolen, the incident was similar to an earlier violent robbery involving a group of juveniles at the same station. BART officials did not immediately widely publicize either robbery. When the June 30 cell phone theft occurred, BART was no longer issuing daily police logs of crimes.
This is terribly irresponsible, of course, and it actually worsens what they’re trying to prevent. When you admit that you’re trying to hide crime because it’ll stir up racial animosity, guess what that stirs up? RACIAL ANIMOSITY.

Syria warns that joint retaliation with Russia could be a consequence of US aggression,"Adam Garrie4 hours agoJuly 3, 2017 99
This is the first time a Syrian government minister has linked a Syrian response to American aggression with that of Russia.
Speaking at a press conference in Damascus, Syria’s Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad issued a stern warning to the US, should Washington act upon statements from last week week promising that Syria would pay a “heavy price” for a chemical attack.
Syria no longer has chemical weapons as the US itself acknowledged in 2014.
This of course has not stopped terrorists from making videos claiming that such an attack has occurred, a stunt that Russia’s Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed as “propaganda”.
READ MORE: DAMASCUS: 2 attacks–1 real and 1 fake
Today Faisal Mekdad said the following in respect of American threats and the American proclivity to assume that al-Qaeda propaganda is actual intelligence,
“Washington must thoroughly study (possible) actions of Damascus and Moscow in response to any new aggression”.
This is the first time that a Syrian government minister has explicitly linked a Syrian response to American aggression with a coordinated Russian response.
It follows from Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s statement last week stating that any American acts of aggression towards Syria would result in a response from Russia that would be “dignified and proportional”.",The Duran,1
BREAKING: Former Soviet Intelligence Officer Was In Meeting With Trump Jr. And His Shady Russian Lawyer,"GooglePinterestDiggLinkedin Reddit Stumbleupon PrintDeliciousPocketTumblr
By now, the whole world knows that Donald Trump Jr., former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, and Daddy Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner met with a shady Russian lawyer by the name of Natalia Veselnitskya during the 2016 presidential campaign. It is also now known that they took the meeting with the explicit purpose of soliciting dirt on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. As if these facts weren’t damning enough, it has now been discovered that a former Soviet intelligence officer was in that meeting as well.

NBC EXCLUSIVE: Also in DJTJr mtg: “a former Soviet counter intel officer who is suspected . . . of having ongoing ties to Russian intel”
— Kasie Hunt (@kasie) July 14, 2017
Now, the idea of any American meeting with someone with ties – be they current or former – to Russian Intelligence is deeply disturbing. It is also much more so in the context of clear attempts to fix an American presidential election, which is clearly what this is about. That also makes this meeting most likely illegal on its face. These revelations come on the heels of Trump Jr. being forced to release emails that show a chain of cartoonishly incriminating correspondence with someone who claimed to be working on behalf of the Russian government with the explicit goal of getting Donald Trump into the White House.
Now, we have someone else – someone with much more direct ties – be they current or former – to Russian spy agencies. At this point, there is no doubt that there was a serious willingness on the part of the Trump campaign to collude with the Russians to tip the odds in Trump’s favor.
I’m no lawyer, but I would think that something like this pretty much has to amount to some kind of federal crime. If this isn’t illegal collusion, I don’t know what is.

‘Please delete your account’: Sarah Palin slammed for using ‘neo-Nazi’ slogan to praise Trump,"07 Jul 2017 at 15:20 ET
Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story!
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin whipped up a social media firestorm on Friday after a tweet praising President Donald Trump included a phrase associated with the Neo-Nazi movement.
“Trump Gives Speech to the People of Poland, Says 14 Words That Leave Americans Stunned,” Palin wrote, with a link to a story about the president’s recent address in Warsaw. The article itself makes no mention of 14 words used by Trump.

Conservative author Ann Coulter similarly raised some eyebrows earlier this year when she tweeted out the message “14!” Several neo-Nazi affiliated accounts took the message a sign of support, but Coulter later said the tweet was a reference to the days left in Barack Obama’s presidency.

WARSAW — After a warm welcome in Poland, President Trump's European visit gets significantly more difficult with two days of meetings on some of the world's most difficult problems: Terrorism, North Korea, immigration and climate change.
For a president who values face-to-face negotiations, Trump has some of the most challenging foreign policy meetings of his six-month-old presidency lined up this weekend in Hamburg, Germany, where world leaders are gathering for the G-20 summit. They include:
► Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom U.S. intelligence agencies accuse of orchestrating a campaign of cyberattacks and fake news to hijack the 2016 presidential election to get Trump elected. Multiple congressional committees and a special counsel are now investigating Russia's interference and possible collusion with Trump campaign associates.
► Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose warm relationship with Trump — forged at his Mar-a-Lago resort in April — has soured over the North Korean issue, especially after Pyongyang's first successful intercontinental ballistic missile test earlier this week.
► German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the host of the summit, who has set out a global agenda on trade, immigration and climate change that is directly opposed to Trump's go-it-alone policies.
In Warsaw on Thursday, Trump repeated his position that Russia probably tried to tamper with the election, but ""nobody really knows for sure"" and that others may be involved.
That sets the stage for the first one-on-one meeting between the U.S. and Russian presidents. The Kremlin said the meeting was expected to last an hour; the White House schedule allots less than 35 minutes. Both agree that terrorism leads the agenda.
The first stop on Trump's four-day trip was Warsaw, where he met with President Andrzej Duda, leader of a right-of-center government that shares a kinship with the Trump administration on some key issues: Closing borders to refugees, ramping up defense spending and — as the two presidents showed Thursday — lashing our at the press.
Trump also lent his support for a joint Polish-Croatian effort to unite 12 eastern European counties on infrastructure projects that would make them less reliant on Russia.
In a speech to the Polish people. Trump laid out a vision for U.S.-European relations that sees Western civilization itself as under attack from terrorism, extremism and multi-national bureaucracies that subvert national self-determination. ""The West was saved with the blood of patriots,"" he said, and ""each generation must rise up and play their part in its defense.""
Trump then flew to Hamburg, site of the economic summit of the world's largest 20 economies. He met first with Merkel and then had dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-In.
China's president was not invited, even though the purpose of the meeting was to discuss North Korea's test launch of a multi-stage rocket this week.
But despite tweets this week suggesting that he had tried everything he could with China, Trump said Thursday he hadn't written off Chinese help. ""Never give up,"" he said.
Earlier in the day, Trump said the consequences for North Korea would be ""severe,"" but that ""I don't draw red lines.""

Twitter Explodes With Ridicule of Trump’s Accidentally Truthful ‘Failed’ Trumpcare Tweet,"July 14, 2017Samantha Layne News
That Awkward Moment When You Accidentally Tweet The Truth
Donald Trump mistakenly tweeted the truth this morning.
I know – that should be a major headline, right?
His twitter feed is filling up, as he desperately tries to turn attention away from his eldest son’s open admittance on Russian collusion, and the constant development on that story. And, in a pathetic attempt to reassure the people who actually believe him that yeah, sure, he’s totally still concerned about things like healthcare but, just so you know, it’s not up to him, it’s Congress, so blame them for everything, he tweeted the following:
Republicans Senators are working hard to get their failed ObamaCare replacement approved. I will be at my desk, pen in hand!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 14, 2017
He repeated the whole “pen in hand” thing, ignoring the fact that every time a president has gotten major healthcare legislation passed, it’s been because he worked his own ass off to lobby it to Congress and the American people.
But the jewel of his tweet was the “failed Obamacare replacement,” which places the failure squarely on the replacement “plans” Congress has tried to pass. (We’re currently on number three, and this one is the worst one of all.)
Twitter Reacts To Trump’s Truthiness
Twitter was quick to point out Trump’s accidental truth telling.
Their failed replacement is right. Taking healthcare away from 22M people to fund tax breaks for rich people is a disgrace.

The Russians targeted the RNC using the same methods as in the DNC attack. However, the RNC had better security in place to prevent the emails from reaching people who could enable them to do harm
In addition the Russians attempted to compromise the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank. However, that attack was unsuccessful as well.

CNN Admits They Published FAKE NEWS – Forced To Apologize,"Fake News CNN was forced not only to remove a fake news story that they made up but was forced to apologize to the individual that they smeared as they tried desperately to connect Trump associates to “Russia.”

On June 22, 2017, CNN.com published a story connecting Anthony Scaramucci with investigations into the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
That story did not meet CNN’s editorial standards and has been retracted. Links to the story have been disabled. CNN apologizes to Mr. Scaramucci.
Because it is important to document the lies that come from CNN, an online archive was made of their original report.
Here is the entire fake news report that was written by CNN that they have now removed from their website:
Senate investigators are examining the activities of a little-known $10-billion Russian investment fund whose chief executive met with a member of President Donald Trump’s transition team four days before Trump’s inauguration, a congressional source told CNN.
The source said the Senate intelligence committee is investigating the Russian fund in connection with its examination of discussions between White House adviser Jared Kushner and the head of a prominent Russian bank. The bank, Vnesheconombank, or VEB, oversees the fund, which has ties to several Trump advisers. Both the bank and the fund have been covered since 2014 by sanctions restricting U.S. business dealings.
Separately, the Treasury Department has been looking into the Jan. 16 meeting between the fund’s chief executive and Anthony Scaramucci, a member of the transition team’s executive committee and a fundraiser and adviser for Trump’s presidential campaign, according to a Jan. 30 letter from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
Two Democratic senators asked Treasury to investigate whether Scaramucci promised to lift sanctions — a policy shift that would help the fund attract more international investment to Russia.
The inquiries draw attention to the Russian Direct Investment Fund, a government investment arm that has helped top U.S. private-equity firms invest in Russia and that was advised by Stephen Schwarzman, who is now chairman of Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum, an advisory group of business leaders.
Schwarzman, chief executive officer of Blackstone Group, was named in 2011 to the fund’s International Advisory Board along with other leaders of major equity companies and sovereigh-wealth funds who reviewed the fund’s operations, plans and potential investments. Schwarzman declined to comment. A source close to him said Schwarzman has not spoken to anyone on the fund “for some time.”
The fund also worked with Goldman Sachs, whose former president Gary Cohn is Trump’s chief economic adviser and where Kirill Dmitriev, the fund’s chief executive, worked as an investment banker in the 1990s. Goldman was part of a consortium created in 2012 to invest in large Russian businesses preparing to go public, and was hired in 2013 to burnish Russia’s investment image. The company declined to comment.
Senate and House investigators are looking into various Russian entities to determine whether anyone connected to the Trump campaign helped Russians as they meddled in the 2016 presidential election, and whether Trump associates discussed sanctions with Russian officials.
The congressional inquiries, along with a criminal investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller, have shadowed the Trump administration. Trump has denied any connection to Russia’s election-meddling, calling the criminal probe “a witch hunt.”
Scaramucci, a billionaire founder of SkyBridge Capital, minimized his January meeting with Dmitriev in the resort town of Davos, Switzerland, at the celebrated annual gathering of the World Economic Forum. Scaramucci had met Dmitriev at previous Davos meetings, although at the gathering in January, Scaramucci was expecting to be named White House liaison to the business community.
Dmitriev “came over to say hello in a restaurant, and I was cordial,” Scaramucci said in a recent email to CNN. “There is nothing there.”
The day after the meeting, Scaramucci told Bloomberg TV that he had “as a private citizen” been working with Dmitriev on bringing a delegation of executives to Russia.
“What I said to him last night, in my capacity inside the administration, I would certainly reach out to some people to help him,” Scaramucci said before describing a thicket of ethical clearances he would face. “The idea was many months ago to have more outreach with Russia but also other countries, not just Russia. China, other countries.”
Scaramucci’s comments alarmed Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ben Cardin of Maryland, who asked Mnuchin investigate whether Scaramucci sought to “facilitate prohibited transactions” or promised to waive or lift sanctions against Russia.
In a reply Jan. 30, before he was sworn in, Mnuchin said he would “ensure the appropriate Department components assess whether further investigation of this matter is warranted.” The Treasury Department did not respond to CNN requests for an update.
A spokeswoman for the Russian fund said the two men did not discuss sanctions, and that the discussion itself did not violate sanctions that U.S. imposed in 2014 after Russia annexed part of neighboring Ukraine. The spokeswoman declined to describe the conversation, saying, “We do not comment on private meetings.”
Since Trump’s election, Dmitriev has been one of Russia’s most vocal officials in calling for an end to U.S. sanctions and arguing that joint U.S.-Russia projects can create jobs in the United States.
The fund hired two U.S. lobbying firms in September 2014, after sanctions were imposed, paying them a combined $150,000 over two months for public relations work. The fund has not hired any lobbyists since then.
With a history of helping U.S. manufacturers and asset management companies invest in Russia, the fund is a logical starting point for Russia’s push to lift U.S. sanctions, former State Department chief economist Rodney Ludema said.
“If you’re going to get your nose under the tent, that’s a good place to start,” said Ludema, a Georgetown University economics professor. “I’m sure their objective is to get rid of all the sanctions against the financial institutions. But RDIF is one [sanctioned organizations] where a number of prominent U.S. investors have been involved.”
Scaramucci also questioned U.S. sanctions while he was in Davos and echoed Trump’s statements about improving relations with Russia.
Two weeks after the meeting between Scaramucci and Dmitriev, when President Trump spoke by phone to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the fund announced it would open an office in New York in May.
No New York office has been opened but the fund “still expects to open a representative office in the US this year,” the spokeswoman said.
This record will remain forever as just one of the millions of lies that have come from CNN!

Trump on MSM: “I’m President and they’re not”,"Adam Garrie17 hours agoJuly 2, 2017 546
A sitting POTUS is a soldier in the information war.
Donald Trump has used a speech at the Kennedy Centre honouring veterans to give an incredibly strongly worded statement about the mainstream media.
It has become clear that both sides in what is an open information war and not going to give up. Trump and his supporters in the alt-media, in addition to his political base are now set to be permanently at odds with the mainstream liberal media as well as the political and elite classes in America.
During his speech Trump said,
“The fake media is trying to silence us, but we will not let them. The fake media tried to stop us from going to the White House. But I’m president, and they’re not.
The fact is the press has destroyed themselves because they went too far. Instead of being subtle and smart, they used a hatchet. And the people saw right it right from the beginning. The dishonest media will never keep us from accomplishing our objectives on behalf of our great American people”.
The media war is very much on. It is unprecedented in modern US history for a sitting President to openly declare that he wishes large sectors of the mainstream media to economically collapse. Judging by their falling ratings, it seems that many in America and the wider world agree with Trump.",The Duran,1
Bill O’Reilly: Trump won’t make it four years if he can’t get this done,"Tré Goins-Phillips 1 hour
Former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly said Friday during an appearance on “The Glenn Beck Program” that President Donald Trump might not make it through his entire four-year term if he doesn’t get tax reform done soon. (2014 file photo/Elsa/Getty Images)
Former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly told conservative radio host Glenn Beck on Friday that President Donald Trump won’t last four years in the White House if he doesn’t get the ball rolling on tax reform.
“I think the president has got to stop everything and just, you know, get into the tax cut business and get in fast,” O’Reilly said, adding that Trump won’t “have any power” if he doesn’t, because the Republican Party “is turning on him.”
O’Reilly’s bold prediction prompted Beck to ask if that means he believes Trump will be impeached. The former Fox host said that, once the president loses support from his base, “they walk away.”
“Then the bad guys come in, and they’re going to throw everything at him. They’ll trump up stuff, they’ll make up stuff,” he asserted. “[I]f he loses his support, and he hasn’t so far. His people are staying with him.”
Beck agreed, but noted many of the president’s supporters “are softening” on their unshakable defense of Trump.
In late April, the White House unveiled a one-page summary of the Trump administration’s tax reform plans. Speaking to reporters at the time, chief economic adviser Gary Cohn described the proposal as the “biggest tax cut” in American history.
The plan cuts the number of income tax brackets from seven to three, with the top rate being 35 percent, the median rate being 25 percent, and the lowest 10 percent. And perhaps the most eye-popping cut is the White House suggestion to slash the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent.
It should be noted that administration officials believe it would be difficult to get the corporate rate as low as Trump’s promised 15 percent. Instead, the White House is aiming for right around 20 percent — a rate House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Thursday is “very realistic.”
Vice President Mike Pence, trying to sell retailers on Trump’s tax plan, said Tuesday that the president “is going to work with this Congress this year, and we’re going pass the largest tax cut since the days of Ronald Reagan.”
“When it comes to your businesses, our tax plan is going to put American companies, including our retailers, back on a path to jobs and growth and better competitiveness,” Pence said during an event hosted by the National Retail Federation, The Hill reported.
But despite all the talk about tax reform, little has been done to advance the issue. To date, Congress and the White House have been trapped in a so far unsuccessful fight to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.
As for O’Reilly’s prediction about Trump’s tenure in office, Beck said later in his show that he felt his guest “made news” with his claims.
“If Congress doesn’t pass tax cuts, [Trump’s] base will erode, and then the wolves will eat,” Beck warned. “And I think [O’Reilly’s] exactly right.”",TheBlaze,1

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spurred Republican senators Thursday to resolve internal disputes that have pushed their marquee health care bill to the brink of oblivion. Yet the GOP's reeling effort to dismantle much of President Barack Obama's health care law may face even longer odds because of Sen. John McCain's jarring diagnosis of brain cancer.
""Dealing with this issue is what's right for the country,"" McConnell, R-Ky., said. He added, ""It was certainly never going to be easy, but we've come a long way and I look forward to continuing our work together to finally bring relief.""
Nursing a slender 52-48 majority, McConnell has been unable to muster the 50 votes he'd need to approve his party's health care overhaul. Vice President Mike Pence would cast the tie-breaking vote.
But with McCain, R-Ariz., receiving treatment back home for an uncertain period of time, McConnell's numerical advantage has dwindled. In McCain's absence, if just two Republicans defect it would sink President Donald Trump's and the GOP's banner legislative priority, and more than that have said they are ready to do so.
Aiming to finally resolve the issue, McConnell has said he'll force a vote on the legislation early next week.
After a face-to-face lecture from Trump, around two dozen of them staged a nearly three-hour bargaining session Wednesday night to resolve their disputes. When it was over, none offered specific examples of any progress.
""We still do have work to do to get to a vote of 50, but people are committed to continuing that work,"" said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., a member of the GOP leadership who hosted the meeting in his office.
Also attending Wednesday's private meeting were health secretary Tom Price and Seema Verma, the Medicaid and Medicare administrator. It was interrupted by prayer after the lawmakers learned that McCain, 80, had a cancerous brain tumor.
Earlier Wednesday at the White House, Trump told them they must not leave town for their August recess without sending him an ""Obamacare"" repeal bill to sign.
""I'm ready to act,"" Trump said, foisting the responsibility on Republican lawmakers, not himself. During last year's presidential campaign he had declared repeatedly it would be ""so easy"" to get rid of the Obama law.
Earlier in the week, the latest Senate GOP health care plan collapsed, leading Trump to call for simply letting Obama's law fail.
McConnell indicated he was prepared to stick a fork in the Republican bill and move on to other issues including overhauling the tax code. But plunging into the issue after a period of lackadaisical involvement, Trump pressured McConnell to delay the key vote until next week, and he invited Republican senators to the White House for lunch.
There, with the cameras rolling in the State Dining Room, Trump spoke at length as he cajoled, scolded and issued veiled threats to his fellow Republicans, all aimed at wringing a health care bill out of a divided caucus that's been unable to produce one so far.
Seated next to Nevada Sen. Dean Heller, who is vulnerable in next year's midterm elections, Trump remarked: ""He wants to remain a senator, doesn't he?"" as Heller gave a strained grin.
McConnell has failed repeatedly to come up with a bill that can satisfy both conservatives and moderates in his Republican conference. Two different versions of repeal-and-replace legislation fell short of votes before coming to the floor, pushing him to announce Monday night that he would retreat to a repeal-only bill that had passed Congress when Obama was in office.
But that bill, too, died a premature death as three GOP senators announced their opposition on Tuesday, one more than McConnell can lose in the closely divided Senate. Further complicating that approach, the Congressional Budget Office released an analysis Wednesday reaffirming its earlier findings that the repeal-only bill would mean 32 million additional uninsured people over a decade and average premiums doubling.
And a new AP-NORC poll found that Americans overwhelmingly want lawmakers of both parties to work out health care changes, with only 13 percent supporting Republican moves to repeal the Obama law absent a replacement.
Trump's sudden re-resolve to get ""Obamacare"" repeal-and-replace passed came after he's been on all sides of the issue in a whiplash-inducing series of remarks over recent days and weeks, supporting repeal and replace, straight repeal, and finally doing nothing so ""we'll just let Obamacare fail,"" as he declared on Tuesday.
Yet for all the determined rhetoric Wednesday, the basic divisions haven't changed in the Senate, where conservatives like Rand Paul of Kentucky want legislation that fully repeals the Obama law while moderates like Susan Collins of Maine want something incompatible with that, a more generous bill that provides for Americans including those who gained Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

BERLIN — President Trump's domestic approval rating stands at an abysmal 36 percent, but in Europe, where he is even more deeply unpopular, the U.S. president is just about the most reliable political punching bag for politicians striking from the left.
Fresh evidence of that came Monday, when Martin Schulz, leader of Germany's Social Democratic Party and the man vying to unseat Chancellor Angela Merkel, inserted himself into the latest scandal plaguing Trump's administration — Donald Trump Jr.'s meeting last summer with a Russian attorney said to have “dirt” on Hillary Clinton.
Trump has mounted a full-throated defense of his son. He wrote Monday morning on Twitter that “most politicians” would have attended such a meeting. “That's politics!” the president added.
Schulz replied in English to Trump's Tweet, writing: “I wouldn't have gone there. This is not politics.”
I wouldn't have gone there. This is not politics.
— Martin Schulz (@MartinSchulz) July 17, 2017
The candidate's willingness to chastise the sitting U.S. president reflects the depths of anti-Trump sentiment in Germany. But it's also evidence of a no-holds-barred approach by a politician struggling to catch on domestically.
After igniting a groundswell of support for the center-left Social Democrats when he was named their candidate at the beginning of the year, Schulz has fallen steeply in the polls. He now trails Merkel by nearly 30 points, according to recent polling.
[Here’s why Germany’s left has dwindling hopes of unseating Merkel]
In an effort to reboot his struggling campaign, the former head of the European Parliament has made Trump a regular feature of his stump speeches. He rails against Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement and attacks Merkel for countenancing his demand that European countries spend more on defense.
Speaking at an event in Berlin in May, Schulz vowed that he would resist Trump.
“It is the order of the day that one puts obstacles in the way of that man,” he said.
His predecessor, Sigmar Gabriel, has voiced similarly harsh criticism, calling Trump the “front-runner of a new authoritarian and chauvinist movement."" Gabriel described Trump’s inauguration speech in January as “highly nationalistic.”
The strategy is based on sound numbers, whether it is paying off: 87 percent of Germans lack confidence in Trump, according to Pew data.
Merkel, meanwhile, has walked a tightrope. She has emphasized the resilience of German-American ties and the range of interests that join the two countries. But she has also made no secret of her disagreement with the American president, particularly when it comes to trade and the environment.
Schulz's rejoinder to Trump on Twitter may have resonated not just with Germans but with Americans, too. Most found the meeting with the Russian attorney — attended by Trump's son, his son-in-law and several others — inappropriate, according to a new Post-ABC News poll.
Or it may not have. Most Republicans said the meeting was appropriate, the poll found, and people's perceptions were strongly skewed by their existing impressions of the president.

"President Trump SLAMS China As He Travels Overseas, “Trade Between China And…”","Huny Badger AMERICA’S FREEDOM FIGHTERS –
We need to show the rest of the globe that we will not tolerate being lied to nor anyone aiding our enemies.
President Trump expressed frustration with China in a tweet Wednesday, stating the U.S. might not work with the country to curb escalating nuclear tensions with North Korea – and issued a blanket warning about renegotiating trade deals as he prepared to depart for a global summit in Europe, Fox News reports.
“Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter,” Trump said in one post headed overseas for his second foreign trip as president. “So much for China working with us – but we had to give it a try!”
The tweet came in the wake of a North Korean test of an intercontinental missile could conceivably reach the United States.
In a separate social media missive earlier this week, Trump urged China to “put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!” Clearly China never had any intentions of working with Trump and putting a stop to North Korea.
Earlier this year, Trump had asked Chinese president Xi Jinping to help rein in North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un and his nuclear weapons program, but Wednesday’s tweet appears he may now be giving up on that idea. The U.S. president has vowed to go it alone against North Korea if necessary, but his options are few and feature many risks.
Trump is scheduled to meet with Xi at this week’s G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany.
The president left early Wednesday for a stop in Poland before heading on to the summit.
Another Wednesday tweet, this one devoted to trade, appeared to be aimed at China, Germany, and other G-20 members involved in trade disputes with the Trump administrations.
“The United States made some of the worst Trade Deals in world history,” Trump said. “Why should we continue these deals with countries that do not help us?”
President Trump put China in a situation where they had to show their loyalty one way or another. China proved they are not going to work with the U.S. on North Korea.
So, President Trump, should immediately enforce the Hague Ruling in the South China Sea and push China out once and for all as well as enforce some trade embargo’s.

At least 2 dead, over 100 injured after powerful quake hits Greek islands, Turkey's coast

A powerful earthquake shook the Greek resort island of Kos early Friday morning, damaging older and historic buildings and the main port. Authorities say at least two people are dead, and dozens injured. (July 21)

ATHENS, Greece - A powerful earthquake shook the Greek resort island of Kos overnight, damaging older buildings and the main port, killing at least two people and causing more than 120 injuries.
The 6.5-magnitude quake about 1:30 a.m. Friday rattled other islands and Turkey’s Aegean coast as well, but Kos was nearest to the epicenter and appeared to be the worst-hit, with all of the deaths and injuries reported there. Fallen bricks and other debris coated many streets, and the island’s seafront road and parts of the main town were flooded by a small tsunami.
Giorgos Hadjimarkos, regional governor, said four or five of the injuries were “worrying” and damaged buildings were being inspected, but the “main priority at the moment is saving lives.” The Kos hospital said at least 20 of the injured had broken bones.
A wall collapsed on a building dating to the 1930s and it crushed people who were at the bar in the building’s lower level, according to Kos Mayor Giorgos Kyritsis. “There are not many old buildings left on Kos. Nearly all the structures on the island have been built under the new codes to withstand earthquakes,” the mayor said.
Kos’s “old town” area, full of bars and other nighttime entertainment, was littered with broken stone in the streets. Hotels had shattered glass and other damage, leaving hundreds of tourists to spend the rest of the night outdoors, trying to sleep on beach loungers with blankets provided by staff.
“The instant reaction was to get ourselves out of the room,” said Christopher Hackland of Edinburgh, Scotland, who is a scuba instructor on Kos. “There was banging. There was shaking. The light was swinging, banging on the ceiling, crockery falling out of the cupboards, and pans …
“There was a lot of screaming and crying and hysterics coming from the hotel,” he said, referring to the hotel next to his apartment building. “It felt like being at a theme park with one of the illusions, an optical illusion where you feel like you’re upside down.”
Authorities had warned of a localized tsunami, and witnesses described a “swelling” of the sea after the earthquake. A seafront road and parts of the island’s main town were flooded, and the rising seawater even pushed a boat onto the main road and caused several cars to slam into each other. Ferry service was canceled until daylight because Kos’s main port was damaged, and at least one ferry en route to the port was unable to dock.
Other buildings damaged included an old mosque where a minaret collapsed and a 14th-century fortress at the entrance to the main port. Minor damage — cracks in buildings, smashed windows and trashed shops — appeared widespread.
Rescuers were checking for trapped people inside houses after the quake struck in the middle of the night and were heading to outlying villages to check for damage.
Greek officials said the quake was 6.5-magnitude and the numerous aftershocks were weaker but still could put at risk the buildings that were already damaged. The epicenter was 6 miles (10 kilometers) south of Bodrum, Turkey, and 10 miles (16 kilometers) east-northeast of Kos with a depth of 6 miles (10 kilometers).
In Turkey, the ensuing panic caused minor injuries, according to Esengul Civelek, governor of Mugla province.
In Bitez, a resort town about 6 kilometers (4 miles) west of Bodrum, the quake sent frightened residents running into the streets.
Hotel guests briefly returned to their rooms to pick up their belongings but chose to spend the rest of the night outside, with some using sheets and cushions borrowed from nearby lounge chairs to build makeshift beds.
Greece and Turkey lie in an especially earthquake-prone zone.

A Democratic politician is LEAVING HIS JOB TO PROTEST TRUMP IN GERMANY – SEE WHAT HE’S DOING,"Breaking NewsDemocratsNews and Politics
 
G20 Protests Will Have a Familiar Democrat Joining Them
Victor Medina3 hours ago
President Trump has arrived in Germany for the G20 Summit, a gathering of leaders and politicians from the world’s superpowers. While President Trump meets with those world leaders, another American politician will be on hand in Germany, but not to do any good. He is going to throw a hissy fit and protest President Trump alongside the Eurotrash.
Just one day after one of his police officers was assassinated in the Bronx, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is leaving the job to fly to Germany and join protests against Trump, capitalism, and whatever else socialists are against.
As the Mayor of Donald Trump’s hometown, de Blasio has been one of the President’s biggest critics. Even so, going to Germany to protest him seems a bit childish, and the fact that he will be neglecting matters at home is not escaping many New Yorkers.
More on the G20 protests from The New York Daily News.
The day after a cop was assassinated in The Bronx, de Blasio skipped an afternoon swearing-in ceremony for 524 new NYPD recruits ahead of his flight overseas.
A last-minute advisory from City Hall said Hizzoner “will attend several events surrounding the G20 Summit, including Saturday’s Hamburg Zeigt Haltung rally.”
Organizers of that demonstration — “Hamburg Shows Attitude,” in English — say 10,000 people have registered to oppose G20 participants including Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdgoan.
“All stand for an attitude that we find unacceptable and do not want to accept,” Lutheran Bishop Kirsten Fehrs has said.

City Council members said they were unaware of de Blasio’s plan to abandon the Big Apple to push his progressive agenda in Europe.
Presumptive Republican mayoral challenger Nicole Malliotakis blasted the mayor for putting the protest over pressing issues at home.
“Unbelievable. Instead of jet-setting around the world, he should be here doing his job,” said Malliotakis, a state assemblywoman from Staten Island.
“A police officer was murdered, street homelessness has skyrocketed and people continue to get delayed on the trains.”
Malliotakis also said de Blasio should have attended the NYPD swearing-in ceremony at the Police Academy in Queens.
“Of course I would have been there,” she said.
“The mayor should be embarrassed by the way he has treated the men and women of our police department.”

Two Ex-Officials of Vatican-Run Hospital Charged with Misusing Money,"Continue reading the main storyShare This Page

ROME — Two former officials of a Vatican-owned children’s hospital were charged on Thursday with misappropriating nearly half a million dollars for the renovation of the luxurious apartment of Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican’s second in command under Pope Benedict XVI.
The officials — Giuseppe Profiti, the former president of the Bambino Gesù pediatric hospital, and Massimo Spina, its former treasurer — were ordered to stand trial in a Vatican court on July 18.
The indictments — with their indirect connection to Cardinal Bertone, arguably the most powerful internal player during the last pontificate — were yet another sign of Pope Francis’ efforts to root out corruption in the church’s baroque bureaucracy.
Francis, who has sought to embody his message of modesty in the Vatican by eschewing the option of living in the frescoed Apostolic Palace in favor of the simpler Santa Marta residence, has sought to increase financial transparency in a walled city-state not known for open business practices.

This year, the Vatican announced an investigation into the misuse of 422,000 euros, or about $483,000, after revelations by Emiliano Fittipaldi, an Italian journalist and the author of the book “Greed.”
Continue reading the main story
The examples of shady Vatican business practices revealed in that book led to a trial of Mr. Fittipaldi and four others on charges of publishing leaked documents. But a Vatican judge determined that the court had no jurisdiction over Mr. Fittipaldi and over another Italian reporter, Gianluigi Nuzzi.
(Mr. Nuzzi was already known for a book revealing letters deeply unflattering to Cardinal Bertone. Those blockbuster leaks, which prompted what became known as the Vatileaks scandal, led the Vatican to try, convict and sentence Benedict’s butler for releasing the correspondence. Benedict later pardoned the butler.)
Last year, the court convicted two members of a papal oversight committee, who had been on trial alongside Mr. Fittipaldi and Mr. Nuzzi, for conspiring to leak the confidential documents.

The first was a Vatican monsignor, who at one point was put under house arrest after receiving a contraband cellphone inside a cake. (Francis eventually granted him clemency around Christmas time after he had served half of his sentence in a Vatican jail.)
The other was a publicist, who was pregnant for much of the trial and who brought her newborn to court in the trial’s closing days. Her sentence was suspended.
A fifth person, the monsignor’s secretary, was cleared.
Cardinal Bertone, who appointed Mr. Profiti, has not been charged in connection with the rerouted hospital funds, and the Vatican has said he is not under investigation. Francis removed the cardinal from power in 2013, eight months into his papacy.

The Italian news media covered in granular detail the renovation of Cardinal Bertone’s retirement apartment, in which he joined two units into a 6,500-square-foot residence — complete with high-tech sound systems and white Carrara marble — in the San Carlo palace, where he lived with three nuns assigned to help him.
Amid the scrutiny, Cardinal Bertone donated more than €150,000 euros to the hospital.
“It is a donation that reflects my sentimental attachment to the hospital and its little patients,” Cardinal Bertone said at the time.
(Mr. Profiti’s replacement as president, Mariella Enoc, had a less sentimental interpretation of the donation. “Acknowledging that what has happened has been detrimental to the Bambino Gesù,” she said at the time. “Cardinal Bertone wanted to meet us halfway, donating a sum of €150,000.”)

A woman who answered the phone on Thursday afternoon at Cardinal Bertone’s apartment, where he keeps cats and has a collection of soccer balls signed by players of the Juventus club, said she would convey a request for comment to the cardinal. Cardinal Bertone did not return the call.
This is not the first time recently that an unflattering focus has fallen on the children’s hospital, the so-called pope’s hospital. An investigation by The Associated Press this month revealed that recommendations of a secret Vatican-authorized inquiry into sinking health care standards at the hospital had been largely buried or swept aside. The hospital has disputed the report.
Mr. Profiti, who retired in January 2015, nine months into a new three-year term, acknowledged last year in an interview with the Turin-based daily La Stampa that hospital funds had been used in the apartment renovation, but called it a “strategic” marketing investment because the hospital planned to use the cardinal’s refurbished apartment for fund-raising.
Cardinal Bertone, 82, has argued that the home would be put to good use for future officials.
“The apartment is spacious, as is normal for the residences in the ancient palaces of the Vatican, and dutifully restored (at my expense),” Cardinal Bertone wrote on a church blog in 2014. “I may temporarily use, and after me it will benefit someone else.”

Australian Foreign Minister Slams Trump’s Inappropriate Comments To French First Lady (VIDEO),"July 16, 2017 Media, News, Politics, Women
?>&url;=?>ℑ=?>?w=640"" target=""_blank"" class=""socicon-twitter twurl"">
A few days ago while kicking it in Paris with the French President, Emmanuel Macron, Donald Trump put his foot in his mouth. It wouldn’t be the first time, but this comment he made to Macron’s wife, Brigitte, was one that struck almost every woman in power in the wrong way.
While meeting with the French First Family, and after awkwardly strong arming Brigitte, Trump told the First Lady

“You’re in such good shape.”
Well, the world did not find that comment too appealing from Mr. Grab ’em by the pu**y. Especially Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.
During a television interview, she threw her jabs at Trump while saying that she would not feel comfortable if he were to tell her that,
“I’d be taken aback, I think. It’s a rather interesting comment to make. I wonder if she could say the same of him?”
Touche’ Mrs. Bishop. Touche’. Can you believe this all went down in front of the French President? Trump has NO respect. Don’t think there has ever been a President as messy as he is. Just tasteless. View the moment below,

Trump Just Gave Melania A Huge Surprise That Will Warm The Heart of Every American,"Source: youtube, fox 10 phoenix
President Trump and Melania received a special invitation on Thursday from the President of Slovenia to formally visit his country. Slovenian President Borut Pahor made President Trump the offer during the Three Seas Initiative Summit in Warsaw, ahead of the G20 summit.
Melania grew up and started her modeling career in Slovenia, so this is a wonderful opportunity for the President and First Lady. Of course the President accepted the invitation. Details of the visit have not yet been released.
President Bohar posted to Twitter about the meeting:
Predsednik Pahor in @POTUS poklepetala o obisku predsednika in prve dame v Sloveniji. pic.twitter.com/EkPx1wivS3

Melania came from very humble beginnings in Slovenia, so she must be so excited to return to as First Lady of the United States, check out this 2 minute video of where she’s from:
Melania Trump is only the second foreign-born First Lady, the First being John Quincy Adam’s wife in 1825.
It’s so exciting Melania and President Trump get to go to Slovenia. The media loves to bash President Trump by saying he hates immigrants, even though he’s married to one, so they probably won’t even cover this.

Melania Doesn’t Want To Mingle In D.C. – Do You Blame Her?,"Published on June 26, 2017
 
In today’s toxic neighborhood, who would even WANT to?
It’s apparently ‘big news’ that Melania doesn’t want to hob nob with all the DC swamp critters.
Is that so surprising?
Two weeks into her new life as a full-time Washingtonian, Melania Trump is staying true to her reputation as more homebody than social butterfly.
Not that she hasn’t been busy fulfilling her duties as first lady and first mom.
Her top priority has been settling in 11-year-old son Barron — the first boy in the White House since John F. Kennedy Jr. more than 50 years ago.– Read More
Is there some sort of unwritten obligation to become an extravert just because your husband won an election?
Mrs. Trump told ‘Fox and Friends’ this week that she’s enjoying White House life so much that she doesn’t really miss New York. Barron is ‘all settled’ and ‘loves it here,’ she said…
…Questions remain, though, about what kind and how social a first lady Mrs. Trump will be.
Will she dine out at the city’s trendiest restaurants? Pedal up a sweat at SoulCycle spinning classes? Try to go incognito on a Target shopping run?
‘I don’t know anybody in New York who knows her or ever sees her socially and I suspect that will be the same here,’ said Sally Quinn, an author and Washington hostess.
Even the president has described his third wife, a 47-year-old former model and native of Slovenia, as more happy at home than working the social scene.
What does ‘I don’t know anybody in New York who knows her or even sees her socially’ translate to in ordinary English?
It means she doesn’t know the ‘important people’ that I know. Or, said differntly … she’s not one of us.
Well, duh. She doesn’t hang with the socially-inbred echo chamber of ‘important people’ from New York.
People, we’re guessing will check every acceptable box of socially acceptable points of view, and renew their positions as conventions change.
People who were Maxxed Out for Hillary in their donations, and go to all the ‘right’ parties.
News flash, Sally, there are a lot of people who would deliberately schedule a root canal so they would have an excuse NOT to attend such parties.
And maybe the possibility that Melania is one of them makes her even MORE popular with ordinary Americans.
Did you think of that? Probably not.
Besides — have you forgotten Inauguration Day? You should be GLAD she’s not going to your little shin-digs.
She’d out-class you all anyway.
If you think they’re catty now, imagine how they’d be if she kept upstaging them at their little ‘events’.

"Court records: DiNardo and cousin shot missing Bucks men, burned 3 bodies in 'pig roaster'","Attorney: Cosmo DiNardo Confesses To Killing Missing Men
Attorney: Cosmo DiNardo Confesses To Killing Missing Men
Laurie Mason Schroeder, Pamela Lehman and Manuel Gamiz Jr.Contact ReportersOf The Morning Call
Cosmo DiNardo and his cousin have been charged with homicide after human remains of four missing Bucks County men were found on a farm owned by DiNardo’s parents, according to online court records.
DiNardo and Sean Michael Kratz, both 20, are charged with criminal homicide, conspiracy to commit homicide, robbery, abuse of a corpse and possession of a weapon. DiNardo, of Bensalem, is charged with four counts each of criminal homicide; Kratz, of Philadelphia, is charged with three counts each of homicide.
Charging documents say DiNardo told investigators he and cousin set the men up by arranging to sell them marijuana, and instead shot them, burned their bodies and buried them on the family’s sprawling farm property.
According to the documents:
On July 5, he said he agreed to sell Jimi Taro Patrick, one of the four missing men, 4 pounds of marijuana for $8,000.
DiNardo said he picked up Patrick at Patrick's home in Newtown on July 5 and drove him to the DiNardo farm at 6071 Lower York Road in Solebury Township.
When they arrived, DiNardo said, Patrick had only $800, so DiNardo offered to sell him a shotgun for that amount. They walked to a remote part of the property, where DiNardo said he fatally shot Patrick with a .22-caliber rifle.
DiNardo then drove a backhoe that was on the property to where Patrick lay, dug a hole no more than 6 feet deep and buried him.
Based on DiNardo's statement, investigators located Patrick's body in that grave late Thursday.
DiNardo also told police how he and his cousin Kratz set up 19-year-old Dean Finocchiaro of Middletown Township; 22-year-old Mark Sturgis of Pennsburg; 21-year-old Tom Meo of Plumstead Township, in similar fashion.
On July 7, DiNardo told police he arranged to sell a ¼-pound of marijuana to Finocchiaro for $700. DiNardo and Kratz picked Finocchiaro up, but then changed their minds about selling him the drugs and instead plotted to rob him.
At a barn at DiNardo’s property, Kratz allegedly shot Finocchiaro in the head, DiNardo said. He placed Finocchiaro’s body in a metal tank, which he referred to as a “pig roaster,” according to court records.
That same night, DiNardo told authorities he arranged a deal with Meo. The cousins picked up Meo and Sturgis and when they got to DiNardo’s property, they began firing, the records say.
“When they turn their backs on me, I shot Tom in the back,” Dinardo told investigators. Sturgis tried to run, but was gunned down, court records show.
The cousins then placed the bodies of Meo and Sturgis in the same metal tank as Finocchiaro, records show. The cousins then set the bodies on fire and the next day buried them in a grave on the property, according to the records.
At a 2 p.m. news conference at the county courthouse, District Attorney Matt Weintraub said three of the bodies were found in a container buried in the ground.
Patrick’s body was found after the district attorney’s office “made an agreement” with DiNardo, Weintraub said, adding that without DiNardo’s “assistance,” authorities would not have been able to find Patrick’s body.
Weintraub said the two weapons used in the four murders were also recovered.
“These boys can finally go home to their families,” Weintraub said.
Cosmo DiNardo, 20, has confessed to the commission or participation in the murders of four missing Bucks County men. From left: 22-year-old Mark Sturgis, of Pennsburg, 21-year-old Tom Meo, of Plumstead, 18-year-old Dean Finocchiaro, of Middletown and Jimi Taro Patrick, 19, of Newtown Township.

On Thursday, an attorney for DiNardo told reporters that DiNardo confessed to the slayings in exchange for prosecutors not seeking the death penalty.
Weintraub confirmed a plea deal exists, but did not give details.
Kratz has a criminal history in both Philadelphia and Montgomery County, according to court records. In Philadelphia, he was arrested twice for burglary, most recently in December, according to court records. In Montgomery County, he was nabbed in December for retail theft and drug offenses, records say.
Kratz’s arrest reportedly happened in the 800 block of Magee Avenue in Philadelphia. A resident there told The Morning Call that police swarmed the neighborhood late Thursday night, but she did not see the arrest take place. The resident who did not wish to be named described the house where the arrest happened as “rowdy.”
A resident of the house where the arrest reportedly happened did not wish to comment when contacted by The Morning Call.
Several media outlets later reported that investigators from Bucks and Montgomery counties on Friday were searching the Ambler home of Kratz’s family, focusing much of their attention on the garage. Metal detectors were later being used to search the property, according to KYW News Radio.
On Wednesday afternoon, Weintraub said investigators had found a car allegedly stolen from one of the missing men and charged DiNardo with theft.
Weintraub offered few details about DiNardo, who appears to have no criminal record but for a few summary citations, online court records show.
Several police agencies have been scouring a 68-acre farm on Lower York Road in Solebury Township that authorities linked to the four who disappeared.
Finocchiaro was positively identified Wednesday after his remains were found in what Weintraub called a mass grave.
Finocchiaro’s aunt, Tina Finocchiaro, posted on Facebook that she was “completely crushed, heartbroken and numb.”
“I lost my nephew to a crime that is unspeakable,” she wrote. “Nobody should have to go through this. My heart goes out to his parents and all of the other parents.”
Authorities say Finocchiaro, Sturgis and Meo went missing Friday, while Patrick was last seen July 5.
“Our work is not done,” Weintraub said at the news conference.
He said investigators may never know the exact reason why the men killed the victims. He said Patrick’s body was described by DiNardo as “being on top of a mountain” — Patrick was buried.
And, Weintraub said, without DiNardo’s help “I don’t know if we ever would have found [Patrick].”
Weintraub said the investigation remains open, but he is confident police have the two suspects in custody.

According to a leaked CNN memo, Executive Editor Rich Barbieri instructed his staff to send ALL Russia-related stories to him or another high-ranking executive before being published.
Apparently they’re tired of being embarrassed on the national stage because of their constant stream of FAKE NEWS!

This whole situation comes after Breitbart News debunked their latest “fake news” story that claimed the U.S. Senate was investigating an associate of President Donald Trump for alleged ties to Russia.
CNN’s piece was based entirely on information gained from one “anonymous source.” The article suggested shadowy connections between President Trump’s inner circle and a Russian investment fund:
“The source said the Senate intelligence committee is investigating the Russian fund in connection with its examination of discussions between White House adviser Jared Kushner and the head of a prominent Russian bank. The bank, Vnesheconombank, or VEB, oversees the fund, which has ties to several Trump advisers. Both the bank and the fund have been covered since 2014 by sanctions restricting U.S. business dealings.”
During an investigation into the story, a source close to Senate GOP leadership confirmed to Breitbart News that the allegations made in the CNN article were entirely false and politically motivated by Democrats. Breitbart’s GOP source stated:
“This is nothing besides Democrats trying to frustrate the efforts of President Trump’s administration while Elizabeth Warren and those of her ilk spend their days collecting taxpayer funded paychecks while they do nothing but stand in the way of the progress of the American agenda and are responsible for this nonsense. They should put their names on it if they want to waste taxpayer money on it.”

"GOP operative Peter W. Smith sought Clinton’s emails from Russian hackers, commits suicide","Peter W. Smith 81, was a Republican operative. He was soliciting Hillary Clinton’s emails from Russian hackers. Just ten days after giving the Wall Street Journal an interview, he mysteriously committed suicide. Bodies are still piling up around the Clintons it would seem. He also left a suicide note that I find highly suspicious. He left his notes organized, said he was in ill-health and wanted to end it before his life insurance policy expired. Except I’ve never heard of a life insurance policy that pays out for suicide. Just a thought.
In the suicide note recovered by police, Smith apologized to authorities and said that “NO FOUL PLAY WHATSOEVER” was involved in his death. He wrote that he was taking his own life because of a “RECENT BAD TURN IN HEALTH SINCE JANUARY, 2017” and timing related “TO LIFE INSURANCE OF $5 MILLION EXPIRING.” No one does that. That’s bull feces. He was staying at a Rochester hotel used almost exclusively by Mayo Clinic patients and relatives. So, he could have been ill… but it all seems just whacked to me. An employee of his thought he had a heart condition.
Smith was from Chicago and was found dead in a Rochester, Minnesota hotel room on May 14th. The Wall Street Journal reported that Smith “mounted an independent campaign to obtain emails he believed were stolen from Hillary Clinton’s private server, likely by Russian hackers” and implied he was working with Gen. Michael Flynn, then a senior adviser to then-candidate Donald Trump. Smith evidently created a team to track down the emails that were stolen by hackers during Clinton’s stint as Secretary of State. But his primary focus were the 30,000 emails that Hillary said she deleted that were ‘personal’.
From the Chicago Tribune:
A Republican donor and operative from Chicago’s North Shore who said he had tried to obtain Hillary Clinton’s missing emails from Russian hackers killed himself in a Minnesota hotel room days after talking to The Wall Street Journal about his efforts, public records show.
In mid-May, in a room at a Rochester hotel used almost exclusively by Mayo Clinic patients and relatives, Peter W. Smith, 81, left a carefully prepared file of documents, including a statement police called a suicide note in which he said he was in ill health and a life insurance policy was expiring.
Days earlier, the financier from suburban Lake Forest gave an interview to the Journal about his quest, and it began publishing stories about his efforts in late June. The Journal also reported it had seen emails written by Smith showing his team considered retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, then a top adviser to Republican Donald Trump’s campaign, an ally. Flynn briefly was President Trump’s national security adviser and resigned after it was determined he had failed to disclose contacts with Russia.
The local police chief is calling his death “unusual.” Uh, yeah. And Hillary’s still not in jail. Go figure. His death was recorded as “asphyxiation due to displacement of oxygen in a confined space with helium.” Why would anyone off themselves that way? That makes no sense. Smith was found with a bag over his head and a helium source attached. Seriously?! No one finds this suspicious? Give me a freaking break. There’s a lot of ways to kill yourself… that one’s off the wall. And why was his death originally reported as ‘natural causes’ when the coroner and the media both came up with suicide?
Police found a receipt from a local Walmart time-stamped from the previous day, May 13th at 12:53 p.m. The receipt was for the purchase of “Helium Jumbo” and other items. Police also noted that the two helium tanks in the room were draped with vinyl-covered exercise ankle or wrist weights. WTH? The report did not offer an explanation for the weights. Police said because they did not suspect foul play, they had not viewed any security video from the Walmart store to confirm that Smith bought the tanks himself. I find that odd all by itself. Smith has since been cremated. How convenient.
According to the Tribune, Smith wrote two blog posts before his death: one challenging the U.S. intelligence community’s findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and another “predicting” that “the Russian interference story will die of its own weight.” I don’t brook with the whole defense of Russia thing. They have been interfering with our elections for decades. But that doesn’t explain any of this.
Smith claimed he had no connection to the Trump team. He specialized in opposition research. For years, former Democratic President Bill Clinton was Smith’s target. The wealthy businessman had a hand in exposing the “Troopergate” allegations about Bill Clinton’s sex life. And he discussed financing a probe of a 1969 trip Bill Clinton took while in college to the Soviet Union, according to Salon magazine.
Perhaps there is no conspiracy here and it is what they say… but color me highly skeptical.

MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski Makes Absurd Comparison Of Trump GOP Shooting To Clinton Sex Scandal,"In a recent segment, MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski went on an emotional rant against President Donald Trump after the shooting of Republican Congressmen. Apparently, Brzezinski blamed Trump for the incident—even though the shooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter.
“I think that, very carefully, we have to talk about the added dynamic here. Because you have the right and the left – the extremes on the right and the left – you have fake news, you have conspiracy theorists who are really muddying the waters, and we have become desensitized,” explained Brzezinski.
“We also have a president who pushes fake news and conspiracy theories – from birtherism to promoting violence on the campaign trail,” he continued. “I mean, this is the new dynamic here. I’m not putting anything squarely on the president, but I have to say that this is the new added dynamic to what is a very dangerous climate.”
“I know that you’re … on the edge of your seat as I talk about this. I know what I’m trying to say here, and I’ll try and give you a parallel to help you understand: What Bill Clinton did to the issue of sex to an entire generation,” she explained.
“I believe this president is doing on issues of decency, on issues of conspiracy theories, on issues of fake news. I think it’s that simple and we’re desensitized if we even argue it,” she concluded.

Centrist Republicans push back on GOP healthcare bill,"Senate Republicans from states that expanded Medicaid enrollment under ObamaCare are pushing back on pressure from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnellMitch McConnellSenate energy bill would fan the flames of climate change Graham: 'ObamaCare was designed to collapse' Pence pitches governors on ObamaCare repeal bill MORE (R-Ky.) to support the conference’s new healthcare bill.
The centrists want GOP leaders to agree to changes to the bill before they will back their party on a key procedural vote as early as next week.
They specifically want a formula for indexing Medicaid to inflation to be changed so that it is more generous to states getting federal support.
They also want assurances from McConnell on how an additional $70 billion in money to help lower-income people purchase insurance will be spent.
And they are asking McConnell to put tens of billions of dollars more on the table.
Centrist Republicans pressed their demands during a Thursday meeting in McConnell’s office after the new Senate GOP bill was made public.
Republican Sens.

McConnell is betting that the moderates will come to his side before next week’s vote after he made several concessions to them in the new bill.
The GOP leader can’t afford to lose support from any of them.

McConnell needs 50 votes, with every Democrat in the Senate prepared to vote no. Vice President Pence would then cast the tie-breaking vote.
He won over Sen. Ted CruzTed CruzNew GOP health bill puts centrists in vise Insurers warn Cruz provision will 'skyrocket' premiums for sick people Pence pitches governors on ObamaCare repeal bill MORE (R-Texas) by including language giving insurance companies more flexibility in what kind of plans they sell, but the concessions risks support from centrists worried that this will lead premiums to rise on sick people and those with pre-existing conditions.
Emerging from McConnell’s office, Hoeven said he is not sure whether the bill has enough money for states. A long-term “innovation” fund designed to help states ensure people can buy insurance has been raised to $132 million.
“We need to see what amount we’d have now with the increase in the long-term fund and then we can determine from there what we need,” he said.
Asked if the $70 billion in additional funding was enough to ease his concerns, Hoeven said, “This is why we need to see the numbers.”
“I’m reserving judgment at this point. I want to see the [Congressional Budget Office] score,” he said.
Moderates have doubts about their leadership’s promises that the innovation fund will be enough to help people likely to lose health coverage after the generous federal subsidy for Medicaid expansion phases out by the end of 2024.
Collins told reporters that leaders appeared to be double- and triple-counting to address various concerns raised by colleagues.
“It seems to me you’re using that money over and over again,” she said, according to Talking Points Memo. “It’s supposed to relieve the cost of high premiums. It’s supposed to solve the problem with deductibles being unaffordable. It’s supposed to be available for high-risk or reinsurance pool. It’s supposed to be available under the Cruz Amendment to help prevent a huge increase in rates for people with pre-existing conditions.”
A GOP aide said other moderates share her concerns.
McConnell has told these centrists that healthcare costs for lower-income Americans will be covered by three pots of money: the funds set aside for tax credits and refundable tax credits, the $132 billion long-term state innovation fund and $45 billion to treat opioid addiction.
“That’s what we talked about,” said Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) of conversations with the leadership.
Cassidy is one of 20 Republican senators from states that expanded Medicaid enrollment under ObamaCare.
He said leaders pledged the stabilization fund would also be enough to cover the higher costs of patients with pre-existing medical conditions.
“States could use the stabilization fund to address the issues of pre-existing conditions that President Trump said he was going to address,” he said.
But while $132 billion may sound like a lot for moderates, several senators who said they remain undecided on how to vote next week worry it might not be enough.
Along with Cassidy, Hoeven, Portman, Capito and Heller said they were undecided on the procedural motion.
Their votes may depend on the analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, which dealt a blow to the Senate legislation last month when it projected that 22 million people would be without health insurance in 2026 because of it.
While the moderates are McConnell’s immediate concern, he has not completely protected his right flank.
Sen. Mike LeeMike LeeIf Republicans have lost Moran, they’ve lost the healthcare battle   Five takeaways from the GOP's healthcare reboot MORE (R-Utah), who joined Cruz in recent weeks in demanding insurance regulatory reform, says he remains undecided on the vote to proceed to the bill.
Lee was left out of the deal that Cruz negotiated to allow insurance companies more flexibility to sell plans.
Cruz conceded some ground to colleagues who worried the Cruz–Lee amendment would segment the insurance market and cause the premiums of older, sicker people who buy plans that meet ObamaCare’s regulatory requirements to skyrocket.
He agreed to modify the language by tying the lower-cost risk pools of younger, healthier people who buy cheaper bare-bones plans to the higher-cost risk pools of people who purchase more expensive plans that meet federal requirements.
This is believed to rein in the costs for people with pre-existing conditions.
Leaders have also told moderates that the $132 billion innovation fund can be used to subsidize the cost of high-risk pools as well, but moderates are concerned this will leave less money to cover those likely to lose insurance coverage because Medicaid spending reductions.

"Right Before Health Care Vote, Still-Hospitalized Scalise Did Something INCREDIBLE With SIX Words","Source: Youtube, Rep. Steve Scalise
House Majority Whip Steve Scalise called into the weekly whip team meeting from the hospital on Monday. Rep. Scalise (R-LA) was gravely wounded in a gun attack June 14th by a crazed Bernie Sanders supporter who was targeting Republicans during a baseball practice.
Rep. Scalise was reportedly in good spirits when he called chief deputy whip Patrick McHenry when being conferenced in, joking “has the Senate passed the health care bill yet?”
Scalise was a key player in getting the Obamacare repeal bill through Congress.
Rep. Early “Buddy” Carter (R-GA) said of the call:
“We were just delighted to hear his voice,” and added that Scalise told him hospital staff was treating him very well.
Scalise’s spokeswoman said the Congressman called in “to thank the whips for their hard work and let them know he is looking forward to working through the rehab process and returning to the Capitol once he is ready.”
“He was in good spirits and was particularly happy that the House will pass the Wounded Officers Recovery Act noting, ’Crystal and David saved our lives.’”
It’s amazing that Congress passed the Act, and even better that Scalise got to remember them and recognize them in front of the other whips.
The Wounded Officers Recovery Act will allow “the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund to distribute funds to any of their employees who are seriously injured in the line of duty. Officers Bailey and Griner have received a great deal of care and will require more – members of the baseball teams wish to make sure they have the necessary resources for recovery.”
This is great news from Rep. Steve Scalise. It’s great to know that he is getting stronger every day and that Congress acted so quickly to provide aid to the brave officers that helped save his life.

The Texas Legislature’s Session About Nothing is off to a noisy start, spending 30 days and $1 million passing laws nobody wants.
Mostly, our lawmakers are collecting another paycheck to bring back the same bills they didn’t want last session.
Even some business Republicans who’ll vote and pass these laws don’t really want them. But they’re pressed by evangelical Christian conservatives.
You think I’m kidding?
Executives from New York-based IBM came to lobby against LGBT-bashing “bathroom” bills and left confused.
“Members said, ‘I’m going to vote on [the other] side, but I hope it doesn’t come to a vote,” said Diane Gherson, the senior vice president of human resources for the company, which has 10,000 Texas employees.
Lawmakers in both chambers told IBM they hoped the bills died — but they’d vote for them.
“It was sort of muddy where people stood,” Gherson said.
“We want them to know this is a lightning-rod issue for our employees and recruits.”
The best and brightest tech-industry employees and recruits are not muddy about LGBT rights: “Millennial employees feel very strongly,” she said. “They want to live in a community that shares their values.”
But business Republicans can’t support business for one reason: the Freedom Caucus.
This place is full of a bunch of people who vote one way and lead another.
Freedom Caucus state Rep. Jonathan Stickland, R-Bedford
The Southern Baptist-led caucus forced a special session to pass pet bills for Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who opposed LGBT rights with the slogan, “No Men in Women’s Bathrooms.”
Six of the 12 House Freedom Caucus Republicans are from Tarrant or adjoining counties: vice chair Bill Zedler, R-Arlington; secretary Tony Tinderholt, R-Arlington; Matt Krause, R-Fort Worth; Mike Lang, R-Granbury; Matt Rinaldi, R-Irving; and the ebullient Jonathan Stickland, R-Bedford.
Texas’ disorderly conduct law already keeps bathroom order.
The bill “doesn’t seem like its founded in any data or security issues,” Gherson said after her Austin visit: “It seems to be coming from a set of personal beliefs that some legislators hold very strongly.”
At least three different “bathroom bills” have been filed in this Texas House special session.
Stickland, a Freedom Caucus enforcer, said the session’s most important bill is a property tax cap, but he wants the “bathroom” bill passed too.
“Pass ‘em all,” he said during a House recess Tuesday.
“We’re the ones who wanted to get to a special session and pass bills.”
I asked him about Republicans stalling the bill.
“This place is full of a bunch of people who vote one way and lead another,” he said.
“There are a lot of guys here who already have an opponent [in the March party primary]. They’re paying a lot more attention, I promise you.”
Better they kill time than kill off Texas business.

COVER UP? New York Times Omits Clinton State Department Link to Trump Jr. Meeting,"The Failing New York Times got caught omitting key information in a report that connects Hillary Clinton’s State Department to the meeting with Donald Trump Jr.
A Russian translator who worked on behalf of the State Department, including during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State, was reportedly present at the June meeting at Trump Tower with President Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr.
On Friday, the New York Times reported that Rinat Akhmetshin, a U.S. lobbyist and former Soviet military serviceman, was present for the brief meeting with Trump Jr.
Akhmetshin identified an individual named Anatoli Samachornov as being the Russian translator who was present at the meeting at which Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya reportedly argued against the Magnitsky Act, which sanctions Russian officials. The meeting was reportedly presented to Trump Jr. as being about information regarding Hillary Clinton. Veselnitskaya reportedly does not speak English and has given interviews to U.S. news media outlets through translators in recent weeks.
Samachornov would not confirm to the New York Times that he was present at the meeting between Trump Jr. and Veselnitskaya, only admitting that he was working with Veselnitskaya on efforts related to opposing the Magnitsky Act during the time of the meeting at Trump Tower.
The Times did not provide any background on Samachornov beyond reporting his name and that he was a “translator.”

There is no obligation to assimilate? Then why come here at all? The FBI should pay her a visit for declaring that jihad is needed because we all know what that means. Right?
If fighting President Trump is jihad, does that mean the Liberals, Hillary, Obama, and the media are all ISIS?
TGP: Far Left Darling Linda Sarsour tells Muslims to fight jihad in the United States. Fight Trump with Jihad! WOW!
I just had to do a double take. Linda Sarsour just invoked ‘Allah’ and called for a JIHAD AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP?!? pic.twitter.com/a8LRtrHn5Z
— Drew Liquerman (@DrewLiquerman) July 6, 2017
Speaking at ISNA’s 54th Annual Convention, Linda states that Muslims have “NO need to assimilate” and that fighting the Trump Administration is a form of JIHAD!
Linda Sarsour: “Why are we so afraid of this administration and the potential chaos that they will ensue on our community and we already saw their potential when they come out every few weeks, Muslim ban 1, Muslim ban 2, Muslim ban 3.”
“They are relentless, they are persistent and consistent and want to see how much as a community we can endure and wanna see who our friends are and how hard we are going to fight back against this administration.”
“And I hope that when we stand up to those who oppress our communities,” Sarsour continued, “that Allah accepts from us that is a form of Jihad! That we are struggling against tyrants and rulers–not only abroad in the Middle East…but here in the Unites States of America where you have fascists and white supremacists and Islamophobes reigning in the White House.”
Linda Sarsour continued on with her radical speech calling on the Muslim community to be “perpetually outraged” at the current administration. She also calls on her ‘Muslim sisters and brothers’ not to normalize the Trump administration.
Sarsour also said, “Our number one priority is to protect and defend our community, it is not to assimilate and it is not to please any other people and authority…Our TOP PRIORITY even higher than all those priorities is to please Allah and ONLY Allah!”
Linda Sarsour has ties to the terrorist group, Hamas and is a Sharia law advocate who pushes to replace our Constitution with laws from a medieval death cult.
Fun fact: Sarsour means ‘cockroach’ in Arabic. Fitting, isn’t it?

A pipeline that would cut through the iconic Appalachian Trail sparks a fight over natural gas expansion
BY Evan Halper | Photography by Carolyn Cole
July 14, 2017 | Reporting from Roanoke, Va.
The view from the Appalachian Trail in Virginia's Mountain Lake Wilderness will be changed forever if the Mountain Valley pipeline project is approved.
The stretch of Appalachian Trail through the Blue Ridge Mountains here is prized by hikers from around the world for its open ridgelines, spectacular geologic formations and challenging slopes.
But one of the country’s most iconic viewsheds could soon be changed forever to make room for an energy project favored not just by fossil fuel industry boosters like President Trump, but also Virginia’s Democratic governor.
A natural gas developer with some powerful political allies is nearing final approval to plow a pipeline corridor as wide as 150 feet, tracking the trail for dozens of miles and burrowing through it at one point.
Amid the nation’s ongoing boom in natural gas production, federal rules have made pipeline construction an extremely lucrative enterprise, even in markets where the need is hotly debated.
To many, the Mountain Valley Pipeline has become a symbol of the building frenzy. Concern stretches all the way to California, where climate activists worry that such projects are undermining their efforts. Leaders of the Pacific Crest Trail Assn. fear that gas companies feel increasingly emboldened to impose an ever bigger footprint on protected lands.
“Everybody, not only in the East, but around every national scenic trail, should be concerned about this,” said Andrew Downs, regional director with the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, the 90-year-old nonprofit organization entrusted by the National Park Service decades ago with the task of managing the trail. The conservancy has never found it necessary to get involved in a pipeline fight in this way, but times have changed. “We’ve never seen pipelines of this size and magnitude,” Downs said.
The conservancy is joined by preservationists deeply concerned that the pipeline route would cut through seven historic districts. Those include the picture-postcard village of Newport, a place where generations of families have picnicked by the 100-year-old covered bridge and gathered at the 164-year-old church in the center of town. The pipeline has pushed Newport onto the list of “most endangered historic places” compiled by the group Preservation Virginia.
The same glut of natural gas that helped the U.S. substantially cut its greenhouse gas emissions is now also threatening efforts to fight climate change. In communities being rattled by the rush to lay pipe, the natural gas projects are drawing the kind of rancor usually associated with more imposing and disruptive oil pipelines.
With some 9,000 new miles of pipeline in the planning stages nationwide, natural gas expansions are threatening to undermine greenhouse gas emission reduction goals already agreed to by Virginia and other states hosting the projects.
“Gas helped this country get off coal, but now deep decarbonization requires getting off gas,” said Michael Wara, an energy law scholar Stanford University. “If we build all this gas capacity, we will have a strong incentive to use it for its useful life, which extends well into 21st century. That will blow our climate goals.”

The benefit the Mountain Valley Pipeline would bring to those living along its 303-mile route is a point of intense disagreement and opinion does not cut neatly along partisan lines. There are local tea party leaders and Trump enthusiasts who revile the plan, and die-hard Democrats who see it as salvation. The project’s investors are joined by Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe and some community leaders in promising that it will boost the economy in ways that are otherwise impossible, such as luring manufacturing businesses that will only locate in Virginia if more cheap gas is readily available.
“With the reserves we have right now on the East Coast, we are able to bring that energy to homes and business at reduced rates,” said Natalie Cox, a pipeline spokeswoman. “The availability of natural gas typically attracts manufacturing facilities. It is good for businesses.” Company officials said advocates were exaggerating the negative impacts on the Appalachian Trail.
Critics, including several national environmental organizations, say the benefits won’t be reaped by residents along the route, but by investors angling for a windfall. Those investors are permitted to collect an impressive 15% return on the project under federal rules left over from a time when domestic gas was not so plentiful and policies were designed to aggressively promote its discovery.
“The regulators are not looking carefully at which of these projects are appropriate and which are not,” said Thomas Hadwin, an area opponent of the pipeline and former utility executive with deep experience in permitting multibillion-dollar energy projects.
Pipelines are getting way overbuilt. We have a glut of them.
— Thomas Hadwin, Mountain Valley Pipeline opponent and former utility executive
It is not just pipeline opponents raising red flags. The Environmental Protection Agency in the final days of the Obama administration pushed federal energy regulators to more thoroughly investigate whether such projects are needed. It warned during the environmental review of the Mountain Valley Pipeline that the group building it had failed to explain why the project as proposed was essential, raising “the possibility of overbuilding, unnecessary disruption of the environment and unneeded exercise of eminent domain.”
Soon after, Norman Bay, the outgoing chief of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees pipeline permitting, surprised the gas industry and activists by cautioning that the federal approval process for gas pipelines was full of shortcomings, creating a risk of overbuilding. In a six-page essay filed as part of a commission proceeding, Bay, long an ally of the industry, opined that regulators are not paying enough attention to legitimate concerns about the long-term viability of the projects, their impact on global warming and the hardships they can cause for communities along their routes.
The White House is hardly embracing such warnings. President Trump is vowing to step up the nation’s natural gas production, and he is working with the gas industry to substantially boost exports of American gas abroad, an issue he emphasized on his recent trip to Europe for the G-20 summit. Environmental groups suspect that much of the gas shipped through the Mountain Valley Pipeline will ultimately end up abroad, despite assurances from the developer and the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission that the project is not designed for that.

The boom in gas pipeline construction was helped along in large part by the Obama administration, as it pursued an “all of the above” energy strategy. But Obama’s action on climate change in his final years in office sought to slow things down. The Clean Power Plan, Obama’s signature policy for addressing global warming, placed limits on the amount of natural gas that energy-producing states could use to meet federal emissions targets while transitioning from coal. The administration’s hope was to deter states from locking themselves into generations of reliance on gas, and instead prod them to leave room for a more robust expansion of renewable energy as its cost drops.
In March, Trump ordered the dismantling of the Clean Power Plan. But while the prevailing sentiment from Washington now more heavily favors pipeline investors, gas companies are finding their projects increasingly a tougher sell in the rest of the country. The local disruption the Mountain Valley Pipeline threatens along its route in Virginia and West Virginia has touched off an intense backlash.
Carolyn Reilly wasn’t an activist when she moved to the Blue Ridge Mountains four years ago. She was a home-schooling mom from suburban Florida, lured there by a bucolic patch of land and visions of launching a sustainable farming business. Now she finds herself rallying her neighbors to fight and calling the police every time pipeline surveyors try to access her property.
The easement the Mountain Valley Pipeline is seeking on Four Corners Farm, her family’s business in the hills outside Roanoke, cuts right through a peaceful pasture where a handful of cows were recently meandering. If given final approval, the pipeline company could use eminent domain to get it, and then set about tearing a pathway as wide as 150 feet with heavy machinery so that a 3½-foot diameter gas line could be buried underneath. Reilly worries about grazing patterns being disrupted, pesticides used to control vegetation on the corridor drifting into her crops and the property’s pristine water getting contaminated. “We believe this pipeline would destroy our business,” she said.
Protesters against the Mountain Valley Pipeline gather near the Greenbrier River Crossing near Pence Springs, West Virginia. The historic town of Newport, Virginia could be permanently changed if the Mountain Valley Pipeline project is approved and built directly through the center of town.

Some 130 miles away on a recent night, a group of West Virginians along the pipeline route gathered beside the Greenbrier River to build a large bonfire, fueled by copies of the pipeline construction application. “What they say in this is totally not true,” said longtime local resident Ashby Berkley, pointing to the charred documents.
Pipeline promoters say such grumbling is the exception and that they enjoy the support of a quiet majority in the area. They point to strong support from business leaders and chambers of commerce, as well as a poll they commissioned showing that 62% of Virginians support the project. Activists say the poll is bunk because poll-takers told those surveyed that the project was needed to meet the region’s energy needs. Three-quarters of landowners in the path of the pipeline have signed easement agreements, according to the pipeline company.
For now the project is in a holding pattern because the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission lacks enough sitting members to approve it. Trump’s nominees to fill those commission seats are awaiting congressional approval.
Meanwhile, opponents are preparing lawsuits and lobbying Congress.
“They thought we were just a bunch of hillbillies that they could roll right over,” said Diana Christopulos, president of the Roanoke chapter of the Appalachian Trail Club, as she walked along the trail recently. “They were wrong.”

The dress that Melania Trump wore at the G20 summit today caught everyone’s attention.
Melania Trump has met with Russian President Vladimir Putin mere moments after he completed a two hour and 16 minute with United States President Donald Trump.
The 5 foot 11 inches former model towered over the 5ft-six inches politician as they greeted each other with a warm smile.
The first lady sported a white shining, knee-length dress, which was much more vibrant and eye-catching than her usual outfits.
She would then go on and greet other notables – including French first lady Brigette Macron – before posing in a photo with all the political leaders and their spouses before the leaders met for more talks.
Just prior, President Donald Trump’s face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin stretched on for more than two hours – and was quickly followed by news the U.S. and Russia had reached an agreement on a cease fire in Syria.
The sign of possible progress in Syria – where Russia is the primary backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad – came more than two hours after Trump said it was ‘an honor’ to meet Putin.
It had already been a hectic day for Melanina, who had just recently made it to the G20 summit with her husband after earlier being trapped inside her hotel by violent rioters.
Wearing a dove white frilled shoulder-cut dress, the FLOTUS stood next to her husband who sported a striped navy blue and white tie with his suit.
Sporting white stilettos, the former model wore a simple look and seemed to not be phased by the riots.

"Warning of economic crisis, top UK Liberal Democrat predicts anti-Brexit backlash","British Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament, Vince Cable, speaks on the BBC's The Andrew Marr Show in London, Britain July 9, 2017. Jeff Overs/BBC handout via
LONDON Britain is heading toward a new economic crisis which could raise popular support for anti-Brexit parties, the former business minister and likely next leader of the pro-EU Liberal Democrats said on Tuesday.
Vince Cable, currently the only candidate in a contest to lead the Liberal Democrats, said that historically low interest rates had left the British economy too reliant on cheap money and many people would be hit by rising rates.
Britain's two main parties - the governing Conservatives and main opposition Labour Party - have thrown their support behind the 2016 referendum vote to exit the European Union, promising to negotiate a good deal with Brussels. The Liberal Democrats have instead argued that Britain may yet change its mind.
""There is something here which is not sustainable and it is going to hit us very hard,"" Cable, who holds a doctorate in economics, told reporters at a lunch in parliament.
He said an economic shock would spread doubt about whether the Brexit vote, which Prime Minister Theresa May has taken to mean a withdrawal from all key EU structures including its single market and customs union, was a sensible decision.
""We are getting into an environment where economics comes back to center stage...People didn't vote to be poorer and when they find that that's the environment in which they are in, I think the whole political chemistry around this subject will radically change,"" he said.
Cable, who last week said he thought Brexit might never transpire because the main political parties are too divided over terms for quitting the EU, said his party would be in a strong position to break through when that happens.
""We are not going to advance by small incremental steps - that is not my objective, it is actually to make a breakthrough,"" he said.
""The electorate is very volatile, they have been offered two alternatives neither of which I think are convincing and plausible and I think if we get the messaging right..., we have an opportunity to break through the (political) middle.""
Cable served as business minister from 2010 to 2015 when the Liberal Democrats were the junior partners in a coalition government led by then-Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservatives. Cameron resigned after a narrow majority rejected his ""Remain"" campaign in the referendum.
The Liberal Democrats' influence has since waned and they now hold just 12 out of 650 seats in parliament. Ahead of last month's election they campaigned to give Britons a second referendum on Brexit once the final deal has been agreed.
Cable - credited as predicting the 2008 banking crisis - said he did not think the economic impact of Brexit would be comparable to the global financial crisis as banks were stronger now.
""It's different, it's a more longstanding, agonizing problem,"" he said, highlighting low levels of productivity as the central underlying problem in the British economy.
""It's declining. We are weak relative to other countries ... The underpinnings are weak. All this boastful talk about 'Britain has a terribly strong economy' - I'm sorry it's just not true. There are some fundamental weaknesses.""

Drunk Judge Jokes During Her Arrest – Reality Slaps Her And She’s Not Laughing Now,"Published on July 11, 2017
 
Any guesses as to which party she belongs to?
She’s got a lot of chutzpah. You’d think a judge would be smarter than to do that.
The one who heard her case wasn’t putting up with her BS.
She got busted for drunk driving. Was ordered to appear, and she blew that off.
She was ordered to take a drug test. She blew that off too.
The judge laid into her and her arrogance. He gave her a sentence. Her contempt of the sentence and her promise to violate the terms were nothing short of breathtaking.
From the original article:
Judge Stephen Aronson then sentenced Judge Leticia Astacio to the maximum jail sentence of 60 days, plus three years probation, and a skin alcohol monitoring device for six months at her expense.
Obviously not picking up on the hint, Judge Astacio’s attorney told Judge Aronson that Astacio wanted straight jail time, and didn’t want probation.
“What she wants, Mr. Young, is irrelevant.” Judge Aronson responded. “She will be sentenced to probation. She will be having someone monitor her in the future.”
Her attorney then laid it all out, saying that Judge Astacio was going to refuse to comply with her probation and she would violate it the moment that she’s put on probation, and then they would just come back to court.
“Then we will come back.” Judge Aronson concluded.
Judge Astacio’s daughter yelled out, “F**k you Judge Aronson,” and had to be removed from the courtroom.
Judge Astacio was elected as a Democrat in 2014 for a ten-year term. She worked as a prosecutor for a time in 2009 in the Driving While Intoxicated Bureau of the Monroe County District Attorney’s Office.
She continues to collect her annual salary of $173,700. — BlueLivesMatter
How in the hell is someone who doesn’t respect the law herself — or the rulings of a court — still receiving pay as a judge?
And did it really surprise you that she was a Democrat?
It’s clear that her parents dropped the ball with her. If she’d read this, we might not be telling the world today about how stupid she is.

Raising Righteous & Rowdy Girls
It has been said that daughters are God’s revenge on fathers for the kind of men they were when they were young. Some would say that both Doug Giles and I, given our infamous pasts, are charter members of that club. However, Doug and I know that his two wonderful daughters and my equally wonderful daughter and two granddaughters are truly God’s fantastic gift. With the wisdom of hindsight and experience Doug has written the ultimate manual for dads on raising righteous and rowdy daughters who will go out into the world well prepared- morally, physically, intellectually and with joyful hearts- to be indomitable and mighty lionesses in our cultural jungle. Through every raucous and no-holds-barred page, Doug, the incomparable Dad Drill Sergeant, puts mere men through the paces to join the ranks of the few, the proud, and the successful fathers of super daughters. The proof of Doug Giles’ gold-plated credentials are Hannah and Regis Giles- two of the most fantastic, great hearted and accomplished young ladies I have ever known. This is THE BOOK that I will be giving the father of my two precious five and three year old granddaughters. Tiger Mom meet Lion Dad! — Pat Caddell Fox News Contributor —
In ‘Raising Righteous and Rowdy Girls’, Doug Giles reinforces the notion that little women don t need to be pampered by their fathers to turn out right. And having met his beautiful daughters, I know his philosophy works.

Party and security: WorldPride march sets off in Madrid,"Madrid – Thousands of revellers took to the rainbow streets of Madrid Saturday in the world’s biggest march for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender rights.
Carried along by the slogan “Viva la vida!” (Live life!), drag queens, policemen, activists and politicians started making their way through the centre in celebration of sexual diversity, under the watchful eye of security forces lined all along the route.
Martin Hartz Vratil, 37, came from Germany along with his partner, fresh from the “good news” in his home country where same-sex marriage was legalised on Friday.
“Eventually German politicians came to reality,” he said, as the crowd applauded topless men perched on stilettos nearby.
Authorities and organisers expect one to two million people to attend the parade in the 3.1-million-strong Spanish capital, which has become a global reference in LGBT openness.
By comparison, between 800,000 and 1.2 million took part in last year’s regular Gay Pride parade in Madrid according to different estimates, says Jesus Grande, president of Madrid’s Cogam LGBT Collective, an organiser.

US Designing New Unmanned Vehicles to Help Its Subs Detect Adversaries,"UUVs would give U.S. Subs active sonar without revealing themselves.
BAE Systems has been awarded a contract to develop a small Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) to help U.S. submarines detect and engage adversary submarines. The UUV is part of a U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program to provide the U.S. Navy with advanced new tools to expand the reach and effectiveness of its underwater sensors. If the program is successful, it would provide a critical new capability to the U.S. submarine fleet that would help mitigate shortfalls projected at the end of the 2020s.
A submarine’s principal defensive attribute is its stealth. As a result, submarines rarely employ active sonar, which sends out pulses of sound energy and listens for the reflection off of objects like ship or submarine hulls, because it would give away their position to an adversary using passive sonar, which relies on listening for sound emanating organically from other contacts.
DARPA’s Mobile Offboard Clandestine Communications and Approach (MOCCA) program seeks to provide “extended range submarine detection and precision target tracking through collaborative operations using unmanned vehicles and active sonar techniques.” By remotely operating UUVs equipped with active sonar, U.S. submarines would be able to take advantage of active sonar’s superior detection and tracking abilities without giving away their own position.

As the contract solicitation makes clear, the program presents significant technical challenges. The contract requires the UUV to be 21 inches in diameter or smaller, making it small enough to be deployed through the Virginia-class submarine’s 533 millimeter torpedo tubes (which is approximately 21 inches). That small size complicates the effectiveness of the sonar suite that it can house. Further, if the UUV’s active sonar energy is not directed properly, it has the potential to also bounce off of the submarine operating it, not just target submarines, inadvertently revealing its position. Finally, water is much more challenging than air to transmit the communications signals through to remotely operate the UUV and for the UUV to send sensor data back to the submarine operating it.
But in the face of a rapidly expanding Chinese fleet, preserving and improving the combat effectiveness of its submarines is a top priority for the U.S. Navy. Admiral Harry Harris, the head of U.S. Pacific Command, has testified before Congress that the U.S. Navy’s submarines are “our principal asymmetric advantage over China,” and also that that advantage is in danger of dwindling as the Navy can only provide him about half of the submarines that he needs to meet operational requirements today.
Despite the current operational demand, the U.S. Navy’s submarine inventory problems are projected to get worse over the coming decade. The U.S. Navy has 52 attack submarines today, and the previous force structure goal called for maintaining 48. But under the most recent shipbuilding projection, the attack submarine fleet would fall from 48 hulls in 2024, down to 42 in 2029, and slowly building back up to 48 in the 2040s.
Independent of the difficulty expected in maintaining a fleet of 48 attack submarines, the Navy’s most recent Force Structure Analysis, released last December, calls for increasing it to 66 hulls. Even though shipyards face particular challenges rapidly expanding the workforce of highly skilled workers required to build submarines, the Navy and industry recently reported to Congress that they believe they can build seven additional attack submarines above current projections between now and 2030.
If they can be delivered on-time, those seven additional submarines – which have not been authorized or procured yet – would bring the Navy’s attack submarine fleet up to 48 by the end of the next decade, meeting the previous force structure requirement, but still falling 12 hulls short of the new one.
That shortfall in numbers is why technologies like MOCCA are critical for the U.S. Navy. BAE Systems said in a press release that the new system “will provide Navy submariners with a vital asymmetrical advantage against a rapidly proliferating undersea threat.” DARPA envisions a three-phase program stretched over more than four years to design and test the system. If successful, U.S. submarines might start receiving the new UUVs in the early- or mid-2020s, just as the size of the submarine fleet may be starting to drop.

US Marines rain fire down on ISIS in Syria [Video],"July 2, 2017 | BPR Wire | Print Article
Official video of Marines firing artillery on the Islamic State deep inside Syria emerged Saturday on the U.S. Marine Corp’s Facebook page.
A unit of nearly 400 Marines from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit deployed to Syria for nearly two months to support the U.S. backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in their assault on ISIS’s capital of Raqqa. The unit fired nearly 4500 artillery rounds during their deployment averaging nearly 100 rounds a day.
The Marines were positioned approximately 20 miles outside Raqqa, deep inside Syria. Several hundred other U.S. backed special operators are also inside Syria embedded with the SDF in the assault on Raqqa. The U.S. mission in Syria focuses on training, advising, and assisting local forces on the ground to avoid full scale deployments.

Why we should all be more like Zara and Mike Tindall - the thoroughly 'normal' royals,"Zara and Mike Tindall have always seemed like the most normal of royalsCredit:Steve Parsons
19 July 2017 • 6:38pm
She may be the Queen's eldest grand-daughter, but Zara Tindall has never seemed like a princess. And when she married a great hulking rugby player from North Yorkshire with a wonky nose and a fondness for a pint or two, she sealed her status as the most ""normal"" member of her famous family.
Zara and Mike Tindall have always looked as if they know how to enjoy life. Whenever they are photographed, they always seem to be falling about laughing after sharing a private joke or swinging their adorable little girl Mia between them in a field on the edge of some kind of sporting event.
Here's why the Tindalls are the royals you could picture being friends with...
The couple pictured at WimbledonCredit:Karwai Tang
They had a thoroughly normal wedding (aside from the guest list)
The groom arrived with his rugby mates and chewed gum outside the church.
The bride wore an off-the-peg dress, said she would keep her maiden name and promised to honour, not to obey.
The guests may have included the Queen, but when Zara and Mike Tindall wed in Edinburgh in July 2011, there was none of the high pomp and ceremony that had marked the marriage of Prince William and Kate Middleton in Westminster Abbey three months before.

And there was not a politician in sight.
This was a relaxed, modern affair in glorious sunshine, a private wedding for friends at the Canongate Kirk on Edinburgh's Royal Mile.
They even decided to forgo the traditional post wedding honeymoon and went back to their day jobs on the Monday.

In the past couple of weeks they have been photographed canoodling in the stands at Wimbledon and on a beach in Ibiza.
Looking like a pair of love-struck teenagers on a post-A levels party holiday, the couple messed about in a beachside bar with friends, cuddling and relaxing like any frazzled parent of a toddler would love to.

When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge give each other the faintest of mushy looks, the Internet goes berserk, but Zara and Mike Tindall have never been afraid to show their affection for one another in public.
The Queen thinks Mike is a 'proper man'

Former Tatler editor Catherine Ostler told last week how Tindall overcame ""discomfort"" with aspects of royal life to forge one of the strongest relationships in the royal family.
""The Queen, according to one source, thinks Mike is 'a proper man',"" writes Ostler.
""No doubt she sees a partnership characterised by those rarest of Royal traits: stability, respect, a zinging attraction and genuine affection.""

Little Prince George and Princess Charlotte always look unbelievably adorable in the traditional outfits they always seem to be dressed in, but they must watch their cousin Mia yomping about in her GAP Kids t-shirts and leggings and think she looks altogether more comfy.
But then, maybe it's a case of like mother like daughter. When Zara was snapped on holiday this week, she was wearing a £25 playsuit from Spanish high street favourite, Pull and Bear.

Zara doesn't consider herself to be royal
She has spoken in the past about how she is glad she is perceived as being more ordinary than some of her famous family. ""I've been very lucky,"" she said in an interview with the Sunday Times.
""My parents didn't give us titles, so we've been able to have a slightly more 'normal' upbringing.
""As soon as you've got a title it's very difficult to shed it. My brother and I have been very lucky like that, being able to find our own way.""
She added that she doesn't even consider herself to be royal. ""But they are my family, so I obviously kind of am,"" she conceded.

FBI says probing Michigan airport stabbing as 'act of terrorism',"n"">The Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Wednesday it was investigating as an act of terrorism the stabbing of a police officer inside the main terminal of a small airport in Flint, Michigan.
""I will tell you that we are investigating this incident today that happened at about 9:45 this morning as an act of terrorism,"" David Gelios, special agent in charge of the Detroit division of the FBI, told reporters outside Bishop International Airport.
The Department of Justice identified the suspect as Amor M. Ftouhi, 49, of Quebec, Canada. Ftouhi legally entered the United States from Lake Champlain, New York, on June 16 before making his way to Flint, Gelios said.
Ftouhi stabbed Lieutenant Jeff Neville of the airport's Department of Public Safety. Neville was in satisfactory condition after undergoing surgery and expected to fully recover, police said.
""When the subject went up to the officer and stabbed him, he continued to exclaim 'Allah' and made a statement, something to the effect of 'You have killed people in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan and we are all going to die,"" Gelios said.
Gelios described the weapon as a 12-inch knife with an 8-inch serrated blade. Ftouhi was a ""lone wolf attacker,"" Gelios said.
The airport was evacuated and there were no other injuries. It reopened on Wednesday evening.
A small regional airport, it has, on average, 16 commercial flights arriving or departing each day, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking service.

Obamacare’s Future Now Depends on an Unhappy White House

The congressional effort to overhaul the health care system appears to be in shambles. But the current health care system lives on. And decisions the Trump administration makes about how to manage it could have big effects on who has coverage next year, and what it costs them.
The Department of Health and Human Services is in charge of administering Obamacare, and so far the department’s staff has given many public indications that it does not enjoy such duties.

Tom Price, M.D. (@SecPriceMD)
The press office for the department can be counted on to send a news release each time there is bad news about insurers leaving markets around the country, often describing the health law’s structure as “collapsing.” It has been publishing vaguely sourced maps each week, highlighting in red the regions of the country where it says no insurers are willing to sell health plans next year.
“The situation has never been more dire,” the department’s secretary, Tom Price, said in a July 10 statement.

“Insurers continue to flee the exchanges, causing Americans to lose their choice of health insurance or lose their coverage altogether,” said Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the Obamacare health insurance markets.

It is true that the markets are looking shaky in some places. There are regions of Nevada, Indiana and Ohio where no insurers wish to offer Obamacare plans next year. In many other locations, competition has declined. And it appears that insurers are requesting hefty rate increases in many of the places they will stay.
Continue reading the main story
Continue reading the main story
But the Trump administration, rather than working to solve those problems, has mostly described them as failures of the previous administration. The White House has declined to say whether it will continue to pay certain subsidies to plans for very low-income Americans, subsidies seen as vital to the financial health of the exchange business. And it has suggested that it might decline to enforce the law’s individual mandate. Both of those actions will tend to raise prices, discourage insurer participation and make Obamacare shakier than it would be otherwise.
While premiums for Obamacare plans rose sharply for many customers this year, a growing body of evidence suggests that the insurers still in the market have begun making money and would be likely to stay if not for the administrative uncertainty. So far, there has not been a widespread run for the exits among insurers, but that could change if the companies feel that the administration wishes to actively undermine the markets.

President Trump, for the moment, appears to be leaning toward that course of action. In a Tuesday morning tweet, he wrote, “Let Obamacare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan.” Later in the day, he told reporters that Republicans should “let Obamacare fail,” adding, “I’m not going to own it.”
Republicans control both houses of Congress and the White House. But they have demonstrated that there is not enough agreement within the party to pass a major health overhaul bill. Mr. Trump’s argument is that catastrophe in the insurance markets will be enough to bring Democrats to the negotiating table. That could be a risky strategy.
There is, of course, another possible path. The Trump administration could take actions to reassure insurers and help stabilize markets. It could promise to fund the special subsidies, at least until the end of this year. It could signal that it will instruct the I.R.S. to continue enforcing tax penalties for Americans who lack health insurance. It could promise to advertise Obamacare’s fall sign-up period, increasing the number of Americans who learn about the program and get coverage. It could reach out to carriers and insurance commissioners to help them find ways to remain in bare markets.
It has the power to minimize damage from any of the current health law’s flaws. At the moment, that does not appear to be the chosen path.

Crews search for teen who fell into Washington state falls,"July 27, 2017 11:31 AM
NEAR GOLD BAR, Wash.
Rescue teams are searching for an 18-year-old woman who fell into falls in Washington state and never resurfaced.
KOMO-TV reports (http://bit.ly/2uZyOcn ) that three young women were in Wallace Falls State Park in Snohomish County on Wednesday.
Officials say they climbed over the observation fence and out to an island. They later headed back to the fence, and two women made it when they heard a scream and splash behind them.
When they looked back their friend was gone.
A sheriff's office spokesman says crews searched for the woman who fell from upper Wallace Falls for over an hour. The search was suspended due to darkness and slippery conditions.
Crews resumed searching Thursday.
A sheriff's office spokeswoman says the woman is from Las Vegas, Nevada, and is attending a local community college.
This story has been corrected based on a Sheriff's Office correction, to say the woman is 18 years old, not 19.

IRAQ: Vice President says Iraq’s survival was ensured by Russia’s role in Syria,"Adam Garrie11 hours agoJuly 21, 2017 99
Iraq has become an ally of Syria in spite of the United States.
A day after Baghdad confirmed the purchase and delivery of multiple T-90 tanks from Russia, Iraq’s Vice President Nouri al-Maliki has praised Russia for its vital role in the fight against terrorism.
Although Russian forces have fought terrorist groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS in Syria rather than Iraq, Iraq’s Vice President understands the fight in Syria to be a mutual fight for the security of his own country.
The Iraqi Vice President stated,
“I have said this before and I will repeat it again – if it were not for the Russian stance, the region would be fully destroyed, its map would be new and unusual … Without Russia’s approach to the Syrian issue which differs from the one of the United States, the Syrian regime would have fallen, terrorists would have intensified their actions thanks to this, the regional map would change and in the end it would lead to the fall of Baghdad”.
In spite of Iraq’s deeply dependent, some would say neo-colonial military relationship with the United States, al-Maliki has affirmed that Iraq sees itself as an ally of the Syrian government which the United States continues to have no contact with. In this sense, Iraq’s leaders have become overtly supportive of Russia’s legal intervention in the Syrian conflict which has assured the survival of the Syrian government against a multi-front onslaught by a number of foreign funded and armed Salafist jihadist groups.
READ MORE: Sectarian Iraq has helped save tolerant secular Syria
Al-Maliki who is about to visit Moscow further stated,
“My visit to Russia is coming up … During the visit I shall meet with senior officials including Putin, the foreign minister (Sergey Lavrov) and the head of the Federation Council (Valentina Matvienko).
I shall also discuss supplies of Russian arms to the Iraqi armed forces, we would like the Iraqi army to have Russian weapons as it uses it during training and is familiar with it”.
These remarks show that in spite of Iraq’s relationship with the United States, the Iraqi government seeks to increase purchases of Russian weapons due to Iraq’s familiarity with them.
During the Ba’athist era in Iraq (1963, 1968-2003), the USSR/Russia was among the top suppliers of weapons to Iraq.
In 1966, the Arab Socialist Ba’ath parties of Syria and Iraq violently split. The schism which existed in spite of a similar political ideology prohibited good relations between Damascus and Baghdad for much of the 20th century.
These divides seem to have fully healed in recent years.
America has not been able to influence Iraq’s position via-s-vis Syria, a development that gives one hope for Iraq’s survival as an independent state in spite of years of war and occupation.",The Duran,1

July 24, 2017 1:24 PM
 
The driver of a broiling tractor-trailer found packed with immigrants outside a Walmart in San Antonio was charged Monday in the deaths of 10 of his passengers and could face the death penalty.
In outlining their immigrant-smuggling case against James Matthew Bradley Jr., 60, federal prosecutors depicted the trailer as pitch-black, crammed with somewhere around 90 people or more by some estimates, and so suffocatingly hot that one passenger said they took turns breathing through a hole and pounding on the walls to get the driver's attention.
Bradley appeared in federal court on charges of illegally transporting immigrants for financial gain, resulting in death. The Clearwater, Florida, man was ordered held for another hearing on Thursday and said nothing in court about what happened.
Over the weekend, authorities discovered eight bodies inside the crowded 18-wheeler parked in the summer heat, and two more victims died at the hospital. Officials feared the death toll could rise because nearly 20 others rescued from the truck were in dire condition, many suffering from extreme dehydration and heatstroke.
Bradley told investigators that the trailer had been sold and he was transporting it for his boss from Iowa to Brownsville, Texas, and that he was unaware people were inside until he parked and got out to urinate.
After hearing banging and shaking, he opened the door and was ""surprised when he was run over by 'Spanish' people and knocked to the ground,"" according to the complaint.
Bradley allegedly told investigators that he knew the trailer refrigeration system didn't work and that the four ventilation holes were probably clogged. He also said he did not call 911, even though he realized several people already were dead.
The truck had an Iowa license plate and was registered to Pyle Transportation Inc. of Schaller, Iowa. Company President Brian Pyle said that he had sold the truck to a man in Mexico in May and that Bradley was an independent contractor who was supposed to deliver it to a pick-up point in Brownsville.
Pyle said he had no idea of any problems with the truck until the news media started to call Sunday following reports of the deaths in San Antonio.
""I'm absolutely sorry it happened. I really am. It's shocking. I'm sorry my name was on it,"" Pyle said, referring to the truck.
A passenger told investigators that he and others crossed the Mexican border into the U.S. by raft and were then guided into the trailer to be taken to San Antonio, which is about a 150-mile (240-kilometer) drive from the Mexican border, according to the criminal complaint. He said those in the truck were given no water or food.
The passenger said the immigrants inside the truck soon began to struggle to breathe and started passing out.
At least some of those in the truck were from Mexico and Guatemala, according to diplomats from the two countries.
Latin Americans who enter the U.S. illegally often rely on smuggling networks to guide them across the border, supply them with safe houses and give them rides in the U.S. to their destination.
""Even though they have the driver in custody, I can guarantee you there's going to be many more people we're looking for to prosecute,"" said Thomas Homan, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The Latest: 10th person dies after being found in hot truck
How smugglers use trucks with sometimes deadly results
The temperature in San Antonio reached 101 degrees (38 Celsius) on Saturday and didn't dip below 90 degrees (32 C) until after 10 p.m.
The tragedy came to light after a person from the truck approached a Walmart employee and asked for water late Saturday night or early Sunday morning, said McManus, the police chief. The employee gave the person water and then called police.
It was the latest smuggling-by-truck operation to end in tragedy. In one of the worst cases on record in the U.S., 19 immigrants locked inside a stifling rig died in Victoria, Texas, in 2003.
Immigrants' rights activists have blamed federal and Texas authorities' hard-line immigration policies for contributing to the deaths by forcing migrants to take greater risks to reach the U.S.
""These tragedies are compounded when it's incredibly dangerous and incredibly expensive and we push migration into the hands of illicit actors,"" immigration activist Bob Libal said.
In the May 2003 case, the immigrants were being taken from South Texas to Houston. Prosecutors said the driver heard them begging and screaming for their lives but refused to free them. The driver was sentenced to nearly 34 years in prison.
The Border Patrol has reported at least four truck seizures this month in and around Laredo, Texas. On July 7, agents found 72 people crammed into a truck with no means of escape, the agency said. They were from Mexico, Ecuador, Guatemala and El Salvador.
Authorities in Mexico have also made a number of similar discoveries over the years.
Associated Press writers Mike Graczyk in Houston, Elliot Spagat in San Diego, Peter Orsi in Mexico City and Frank Bajak in San Antonio contributed to this report.

"BREAKING: Massive Obama Scandal Explodes, Records Are Now Missing…","For eight years, Barack Obama ran the most corrupt administration in the history of the United States. Republican lawmakers let him get away with everything because they were afraid of being called racist.
The dirt on Obama continues to be uncovered. Now, a new report shows Obama’s IRS “lost” important emails belonging to Lois Lerner, who carried out Obama’s order of targeting conservative organizations (via Judicial Watch). This is destruction of evidence and obstruction of justice!
It’s a disgrace that Obama was allowed to use the IRS to target conservative groups politically. This is the kind of thing you see in banana republics–not in the United States! Obama’s goal was always to degrade America.
The watchdog group, Judicial Watch, has been fiercely fighting the IRS to get justice for this gross abuse. The IRS has been obstructing justice at every step. The Obama holdovers in the IRS don’t want the truth to get out!
For the last several years, the IRS has refused to show courts the emails from Lois Lerner, who served under Obama as the director of the IRS’s Exempt Organizations Unit. She was the one who would ultimately decide who got approved for tax-exempt status and who didn’t.
A judge actually ordered the IRS to submit sworn declarations about what happened to Lerner’s “lost” emails. The statements provided were not substantive at all. The IRS treated the judge’s order like a joke. With Obama still in the White House at the time, they felt untouchable
Later, the IRS told the court that they had backups of all emails. When called to follow-up, the IRS still “failed to search” for the lost emails. In other words, they just never got around to it.
Now, they’re flat-out saying the emails are missing. What is it with Democrats and missing emails? The truth is evident. If a Democrat deletes an email, it’s because there’s something incriminating in it. It was true with Hillary Clinton, and it’s true with Obama’s IRS!
We can only speculate what was in those emails. Maybe there were directions directly from the big man–Barack Obama–himself. Lerner decided to delete her messages to avoid incriminating her boss. After all, Democrats would rather die (or kill) than let their Golden Boy Obama get his hands dirty. The cover-up is pathetic and sick!
What’s frustrating is that there have been no consequences for such a blatant abuse of power. This is an issue where no one disagrees with what happened. Obama’s IRS admitted to targeting conservative groups and slowing down their applications for tax-exempt status. Obama felt threatened by the TEA Party and tried his best to stifle them.
In total, a whopping 426 groups were targeted (via Fox News). Some of them are still waiting for approval. The problem is that Obama’s IRS head, John Koskinen, is still in place. He needs to be fired!
President Trump is the only one who can put an end to this madness. First, Trump should terminate all of Obama’s appointees. Then, he needs to start a special DoJ investigation to prosecute Obama for abuse of power!
Should Trump appoint a special prosecutor to go after Obama for his targeting of conservatives via the IRS? Share this story on Facebook and let us know your thoughts because we want to hear YOUR voice!

Justice Dept. announces crackdown on opioid abuse by doctors,"July 13 (UPI) -- Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced federal authorities have arrested 120 healthcare providers for opioid abuse as part of a larger healthcare fraud crackdown on Thursday.
He said it was the single largest roundup of opioid-related crimes by healthcare providers in the nation's history.
Among those charged were 56 physicians. The abuses included a clinic in Houston selling opioid prescriptions for cash, another medical group in Michigan that intentionally wrote unnecessary opioid prescriptions that wound up being resold on the street and a fake rehab facility in Palm Beach, Fla., that recruited addicts with gift cards, trips to strip clubs and other drug-enabling behavior.
""Too many trusted medical professionals like doctors, nurses and pharmacists have chosen to violate their oaths and put greed ahead of their patients,"" Sessions said. ""Amazingly, some have made their practices into multimillion dollar criminal enterprises. They seem oblivious to the disastrous consequences of their greed. Their actions not only enrich themselves often at the expense of taxpayers but also feed addictions and cause addictions to start. The consequences are real: emergency rooms, jail cells, futures lost and graveyards.""
In several instances, the healthcare providers also were billing the federal government under Medicare or Medicaid to reimburse them for the illegal practices.",United Press International – US,0
The Price that Julian Assange Pays,"People who challenge power are often viewed by their supporters as more icons than human beings thus missing the personal costs of their actions, a reality that Julian Assange’s mother revealed to Randy Credico and Dennis J Bernstein.
June 19 marked the fifth full year that Wikileaks founder Julian Assange spent at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he was given asylum against the threat of arrest from a Swedish prosecutor pursuing a sex-abuse investigation (since dropped) and possible extradition to the United States for a potential espionage charge related to publication of U.S. secrets.
To gain insights into what this long ordeal has meant to Assange, an Australian native, Randy Credico of WBAI’s “On the Fly” and Dennis Bernstein of “Flashpoints” on Pacifica Radio interviewed Assange’s mother, Christine Assange. The interview also explored the deep history that led her son to found Wikileaks and to challenge the enormous powers of the U.S. and British governments by exposing the truth about their dangerous, deadly and often illegal policies.
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange
Randy Credico: I guess I should begin by asking, how long has it been since you’ve seen your son Julian?
Christine Assange: A number of years, but we communicate.
RC: Yes, you communicate, but it’s not the same, so far away. It must be difficult. I mean he’s not in prison, but it may as well be prison. I know for a mother to be separated from her son like this, it must be grueling, and a difficult row to hoe on a daily basis.
CA: It is. It’s very hard to put into words this experience that we’re going through over the last seven years. There have been periods where I’ve coped and periods where I haven’t. It tends to go up and down, as I guess Julian does as well. And it’s very hard to communicate with your son when you know that every phone call that you’re making, every text that you’re sending, is being listened to. Or even a letter that you write. You end up feeling that it’s almost useless trying to communicate anything real.
RC: That must really take its toll. So it will be five years [on June 19th]. Five years! Can you believe that he’s been there for five years at this point in time?
CA: No, the idea is horrifying to me actually. I mean we know that he’s been detained for seven years without charge, but five of those have been in the Ecuadorian Embassy [in London], and we thank the people of Ecuador for their protection.
But during those five years, Randy, the U.K. government and the Swedish government have refused all of Julian’s requests for the normal one hour a day of life-giving fresh air, exercise and sunshine. It’s a human right abuse of the grandest order.
Anyone who is involved with rights of refugees around the world should be highlighting his case. Here we are in the Western supposedly free world, interning someone without charge, and then denying them the rights that even people in Third World prisons get, including the right to have medical tests. He had a very bad shoulder with bad chronic pain for years, and they refused to allow him to have an MRI test.
Dennis Bernstein: Let me just ask you this question: do you remember the last time you were able to give your son a nice big hug?
CA: Yes, four years ago.
DB: Could you tell us what you remember about it?
CA: It’s hard keeping up with all the fighting, Dennis. It’s very hard to explain. But I got a big hug when I left. I was only there for a few weeks. I’ve actually got a few things here that I’ve got to look after. But probably the best time I remember him is the one with the picture you’ve got on your show, of me and him with his arm around me. That was when he’d just gotten out of prison, and I’d gone over there to campaign for him.
And we were out in the snow, at about 3 o’clock on the morning, outside of the place that he was staying. And that was with an Australian television crew and we were all Aussies together in that moment. And I was giving him a big hug, and they were cheering, and it was a really good moment. It all feels so far away, and so foreign for us all to be there together. And for me to hold Julian, with his countrymen around giving support, was a really good moment.
DB: And now that we’ve got Julian’s mom on the phone, could you talk a little bit about … the first clue that he was going to be perhaps an interesting person, a troublemaker, or somebody who was really interested in public affairs? How do you remember that beginning?
CA: Well I don’t think there was any one point at which it happened. Julian had always been an incredibly curious child, and always wanted to know why — wanted to know how things worked. And I actually encouraged that in him as a child. He would ask how something would work, and rather than say, this is how it works, I would ask him, how do you think it works?
And then we would explore theories at his age level about how something would work, and he was very turned on by all that. I also read him a lot of books. From the time he was a baby, he was read books every day, from fairy tales, to Greek legends, to the adventure heroic classics — Tarzan, for example, where good was trouncing evil, and there were heroic adventures.
The justice part of it was not to any form of ideology, it was just about showing empathy and fairness in everyday life. So I think all those things together — and he came from a creative background — all that enabled him to sort of explore justice, and the power to change.
Then he wanted to know how the world worked. He wanted to be a physicist because he wanted to get to the bottom of it. And he went to university for physics and was disappointed that most of the job opportunities involved working for the US government, developing weapons, etc., and so he wasn’t very happy with that.
And then the next thing I remember, we were having a discussion about the ills of the world and what could make a change in the world and I asked him, what do you think would lead to a change? And he said he thought there are two possibilities: one was a cataclysmic event that knocked some sense into people because they’d have to really look at their environment.
The other one was technology. And I think Wikileaks was the result of the technology that he saw would change the world.
DB: You said something very interesting: that it wasn’t about grand things, but about fairness in everyday life. Can you think of one of those everyday examples that sort of blossomed into the Julian Assange that we know in terms of his vision now for information?
CA: Well not anything specific in terms of day-to-day life, but just in general with people we were dealing with in the family or with neighbors: we wouldn’t walk past somebody who was lying in the street, for example. If there was someone lying in the street, whether they were drunk or if it was a drug overdose, or if they were sick — we would stop and ask them if they were alright. And Julian would continue that. We were in a situation where we were helping some people involved in a justice situation that had to do with the court system, and Julian was boots and all defending people.
But also when he was a young teenager, he was very into computers. So I bought him a computer, and he went exploring on it, and later on he joined up with some other young people. And there was not a lot available in terms of being challenging and adventuring in the suburbs, but these bright young friends of his were challenging themselves on computers, and one of the ways they were doing it was to what they called “look-see” hacking, which was where they’d break in and they’d look at things, they wouldn’t damage anything, but let people know their system was insecure.
Now, in the process of doing that, I remember during the Gulf War that he got in and had a look, and he told me, “There’s stuff going on here that’s not right, there are people doing things that are not right here, and we’re not being told about it — it’s not coming out in the media.”
And I think that also galvanized him into his concept of Wikileaks, which was basically a concept around really good media. And that is that the media hold the governments and the corporations through, basically the truth, responsible to the people.
RC: He has done an incredible job. We are much better off — we are more knowledgeable about our government’s evil actions around the world, and obviously he’s being penalized for that. First of all, he’s been vilified by these phony allegations. How did you react when these allegations came out of the Swedish government prosecutor’s office?
CA: Well I remember the time exactly. It was about 11 o’clock at night when I got a phone call, and the person didn’t even introduce themselves, they just said, “Mrs. Assange, how does it feel to have your son accused of a double rape?”
And straight from my solar plexus I just said, “He didn’t do it.” Because I know my son, and I know that Julian wouldn’t do it. But then I had to go through the whole process of investigating the case because, to defend him, I had to know exactly what was going on.
And so, like those who defended him with knowledge, we had to troll through all the documents, to find out the basis of the allegations, and then what we found was a complete and utter set up. And that was a horrifying feeling to find out that your son would actually be set up on something as serious as a rape allegation, purely because he published the truth about corrupt power.
DB: Where exactly are you right now?
CA: I’m in Australia.
DB: Oh, you’re in Australia! You’re very far away, but you’re very close to us here, and we’re really appreciating the kind of material that you’re sharing about Julian Assange on this, his fifth year of his being held captive, really you have to say by threats of the United States government, who has a special penchant for hurting whistleblowers.
I’m thinking of this carpenter — this illiterate carpenter — who actually fled from fascist Italy and ended up in fascist Argentina. And he used to spout these phrases, and one of the things he used to say is, “Truth has few friends, and those few are suicides” [Antonio Porchia]. Now that’s a very dark comment, but it does seem, if you think about Julian Assange or other great truth tellers, what was waiting for them was a jail cell, or a bullet. Your thoughts on that — that courage that it takes to go forward?
CA: Well the original truth teller was Jesus Christ, wasn’t he? He was throwing the money changers out of the temple. And now 2,000 years later we’ve got defense contractors, the oil industry and Wall Street. And he said, “And you shall know the truth and it shall set you free.”
And nothing has really changed since then. We still have corrupt power consolidating itself, and really destroying the world, and not working on the behalf of people. And it sort of brings me back to what we should be doing, as people. What should we do? Our leaders let us down again and again. They say they’re going to do something and when they get in power they’re either bad leaders who were leading us on, or they’re good leaders who are under pressure themselves. And they’re fighting each other and name-calling, but it’s still not working, is it?
So I see Wikileaks as a uniting point for everybody — from the Left and the Right and everything in between — uniting around the First Amendment, which is what you call it in America, or the free press around the world, to hold our leaders in the business world and in the government accountable through transparency and truth.
And good leaders are actually supported by Wikileaks because if they are indeed under pressure from the Deep State — for example, supposing we assume that Donald Trump is a good guy, and does want to, as he says, “drain the swamp”, which is the Deep State, then he’s going to need Wikileaks — not just during the campaign, when Wikileaks was wonderful and he loved Wikileaks, but even more so now, when the Deep State is going to try to prevent his campaign.
Now if he’s not in fact a good guy, but a bad guy all along, then of course he’s going to want to suppress Wikileaks. And our assessment of Donald Trump very much hinges on whether he is going to protect Wikileaks and Julian.
DB: We were just speaking with one of the attorneys, Jesselyn Radack, who has worked with Julian Assange, and we were talking about the message that might be being sent now by the very strong crackdown and arrest of the most recent whistleblower coming out of the National Security Agency [Reality Winner]. Does that give you pause or concern that Julian might have a tough row ahead?
CA: Oh, I’ve always known he’s going to have a tough row ahead, you only have to look at the way they’ve treated their own whistleblowers, as you said, in their own CIA and NSA. The Obama administration arrested and prosecuted more whistleblowers than all other presidents combined, so things were certainly not looking good, even before this change of administration.
I’m not talking about Reality Winner. I’m not sure where she’s coming from but, even so, wherever she’s coming from, the protocol should still be the same. And I don’t know if that’s the case. If you are a whistleblower there should be protections for you and then it should be investigated and authenticated. And there should be a transparent legal process, and your rights should be protected during that time period. The reason I say I don’t know where she’s coming from, is because they’ve been talking about so-called leaks about Russians, and all the rest of it, and we know that they’ve been set up, that the Russians didn’t hack the DNC.
They’re going to say that there were leaks and they’re not leaks, but because we don’t know who, that’s the reason why we need to protect all whistleblowers, including her, and why it should go through due process, the same as for any other citizen.
DB: We know that Julian was pretty troubled by the way in which The Intercept blew their source in this context. He seems to have been a lot more careful in his work in terms of protecting sources. I’m wondering if you noted that.
CA: Oh, absolutely. I remember when Wikileaks was being set up, that Julian was saying to me,”We’re going to spend two years with the best minds in the world, to create an anonymous drop box, so that nobody can crack it, because we want to protect our sources. And we want people to feel so comfortable in leaking to us and not to feel frightened that they’re going to be revealed”. So he’s kept to that, even to the risk to his own life and liberty.
Wikileaks has never revealed a source — no source has been exposed by Wikileaks. Chelsea Manning exposed herself on the Internet. And very few other media have been willing to rise to that challenge. So it’s best to leak to Wikileaks if you’re going to leak. It’s a pity that she [Reality Winner] didn’t leak to Wikileaks.
RC: Yes. I must say, he really is a remarkable individual. I am not a techie, but he really knows all of this stuff really well, he’s brilliant, but he comes off so genuine. It’s really amazing to see him on all of these talk shows, on radio — how well he comes off. And he’s got a great sense of humor, he’s got an incredible education, he’s so well-spoken, so dignified when he’s on. Does that amaze you?
CA: Yes… well yes and no… because he’s grown up with me, and I’ve seen him, and he’s always been a refined person. He’s never been a crude person. He’s been an honest person and an empathetic person, and he’s always been very bright, so that he got to where he is on the world stage doesn’t surprise me.
Though of course in another way it does, and I’m in awe of him as well — not in any kind of demigod way, but just as a human being with such resilience and courage, and so strong in the truth. And taking the most incredible amount of attacks, not just from governments and corporations, and what they’re getting up to behind the scenes, but trolls.
I mean the thing that probably hurt me the most when watching him stand up for his work, was seeing other journalists, particularly UK journalists, trolling him on Wikileaks with the most vile, immature, picky, vicious comments. I couldn’t believe that this was coming out of the mouths of so-called journalists! And he’s resilient, and the ability to rise above it is quite awe-inspiring, isn’t it?
DB: And he continues on despite it all. He certainly has a resolve and a focus that borders on super-human. He has not been distracted from the work, in fact he has managed to expand it. It’s sort of a bit of a miracle.
CA: Well, Julian is very grounded. His convictions come out of critical analysis, they don’t come out of an easy path of jumping on some ideological bandwagon, so that when the going gets tough, he’s grounded in where he’s coming from. Because he drove himself, he’s not easily shaken by attacks, by ideological attacks, for example, or personal attacks. I think they’ve called him every “ist” there is –narcissist, racist, marxist, capitalist — and on and on it goes. But he knows that the reason he’s doing this is about media truth and justice, and government transparency, and he’s grounded in that reality, and that’s why he’s not so easily shaken.
RC: He is the most fearless individual. I mean he’s got the entire Intelligence Community, the Military Community [against him] — not just here in the U.S. but in Britain — even your own government.
What is your own government doing to protect one of their citizens? Under Prime Minister Turnbull?
CA: They’ve never done anything under any of them! The Labor government under Julia Gillard called what he did illegal and wanted to take his passport away, and she actually said she was quite happy to hand him over to the U.S. and change our extradition laws specifically to make it easier for him to be handed over.
Basically we don’t have a real government, we’ve got a puppet government — it’s just a U.S. puppet, and they’re constantly auditioning through the US Embassy for a place in the spotlight. Prime Minister Turnbull was an ex-Director of Goldman Sachs Australia. Not sure if you’re familiar with the term “government sets”? That’s where big US banks put their people in governments around the world.
So basically it would appear that in the Australian political landscape, if you want a promotion, you will swear on your credentials that you’re willing to tow the line on Assange.
DB: And finally, we’ve got Julian’s mom here, and I have to end this way — forgive me, Mom, but what are you most proud of in terms of your son? What part of his actions, his work, makes you the most proud as his mom?
CA: That he’s standing ethically in truth for justice, with courage. That he’s willing to risk his life and his liberty for his fellow man, basically. And that’s what he’s doing — he’s risking his health, his liberty and even his life, because we’ve heard all the horrible stuff coming out of various commentators: things like “We’re gonna shoot the son of a bitch” coming from Bob Beckel, a Democratic strategist.
And all the horrible things that Mike Pompeo said about him being a demon and “an unsafe intelligence actor.” And nonsense stuff about him being involved in child pornography from both sides, trying to set him up. I mean most people would have fallen over by now. But I think that because Julian is standing for something that’s good and right and correct, I think that’s where he derives his strength.
RC: He does have a lot of support, and I’ve been getting a lot of support from his supporters for this show, on Twitter and social media.
[…] What can people do? What do you recommend people do to help out Julian?
CA: […] Some of the American supporters have been very busy lately. They’ve organized the Boycott UK and it’s under the hashtag #BoycottUK and also the hashtag #FreeAssangeNOW .
This is a very good idea because we all know that money makes the world go round and in fact some are saying that a lot of the opposition to Julian is from greedy corporations because he exposes things like some of the reasons for war, and some of them profit from defense contracts. They also know that by reducing profits for major corporations, they will lean on government to change their policy. So boycotting big UK businesses until they free Julian — all big businesses that are operating in the UK.
Another California supporter … has put up a campaign called “5 dollars for 5 years” and that is about how Julian spent five years in the Ecuadorian Embassy giving the truth, fighting for us, for our right to know. How about if we donate five dollars — a dollar for each year that he spent there? And that will go to top up the Julian Assange Defense fund which is at justice4assange.com. And you can donate your five dollars there.
Also on that site there’s a lot of information — it’s the best site in the world for finding out the facts about what’s been happening to Julian Assange for the last seven years. And let me tell you, it reads like The Bourne Conspiracy — what the government’s been up to to try to shut my son up is criminal and unbelievable.
So, just in America, just these last few weeks, American citizens have been standing up to fight.
But what you’re doing is also incredibly important, Randy. We find that when people are apprised of the facts about Wikileaks, and the facts about Julian, that most come onboard to support him, and some even come onboard as very active supporters. So it’s about getting out the facts, because there’s an awful lot of propaganda and lies. But once people know the facts they are supportive, so that’s also very important that people talk to each other about the facts, find out the facts. And there’s a very good FAQ at justice4assange.com.
So getting out the facts is really important, boycotting is very important, and funding Julian and funding Wikileaks is also important. We often feel very alone and powerless in the world at the moment, but we do have two things that we can still do.
One thing is where we spend our consumer dollar. It might only be five dollars, but if a million people donate five dollars, that’s really putting Julian and Wikileaks in a strong position to fight.
The other thing is the vote: keep your politician on speed dial and yank his or her chain every so often to remind them that we actually pay their wages, and we expect them to stand up for truth and government accountability, we expect them to not get in bed with corruption, and we are not impressed with them persecuting truth-telling media.

So there are just three things you can do straightaway. And of course you can always form your own Free Assange group — it can be a group of one or two or more. And this is what some ladies have done in America and around the world — nice people who have formed Free Assange groups. They are just ordinary people — they’re not actually highly political people, they’re often mothers who want to see the world protected for their children, and they often have no political experience, but a lot of heart and drive and creativity. And they often make the best advocates.
RC: Well, Ms. Christine Assange, I really appreciate you being part of this show. You are welcome back anytime. You are really doing an incredible job on behalf of your son, who is a hero. And I would like to give you the last word. If there’s something you want to convey to Julian and his supporters there in London, I’m going to give you the last word.
CA: Well, firstly, I would like to give my heartfelt thanks to all the supporters around the world who have stood up and fought to protect and defend Wikileaks and Julian. Sometimes you’ve only done one action, sometimes you’ve done more — it doesn’t matter, you did something.
The people in London at the Ecuadorian Embassy have just been troopers. Both Ecuador and its embassy staff and the people of Ecuador and the people from the Julian Assange Defense Fund and Wise Up Action — those guys who stood outside that embassy, day-in, day-out — in the rain, hail, snow and sun — to support my son and protect him. And at one stage, when they tried to raid the embassy illegally and grab Julian, these people were his protectors. And I would encourage anybody who is visiting London anytime to drop into the embassy and stand outside the embassy and join these historic groups.
Show Julian that you care. Show the powers that be that the people care and they’re not going away. Wikileaks, after all, is supplied by the people, with information for the people, for their protection. It’s 100% funded by the people, and it’s defended and protected by the people, including our lawyers. This is a people’s publisher, and it just goes to show you what the people can achieve when they get together. Wikileaks is rocking the halls of power, and they’re terrified. And they have come back as bad as IS [Islamic State] terrorists against the truth, but the people are standing firm.
And to my son, I love you, I’m still here, I’m still fighting, I’m incredibly proud of your work. You’re a terrific human being, and we’re all standing here and we will keep fighting until we get you out of there.

Turkey arrests man with 'hero' T-shirt during coup trial
ISTANBUL — Turkey’s official news agency says a man has been arrested on suspicion of terror propaganda for wearing a T-shirt with the word “hero” on it while attending a relative’s court hearing linked to last year’s failed coup.
Anadolu news agency said Thursday that the man was detained Monday in Ankara. His arrest comes days after an ex-soldier on trial for allegedly trying to capture or kill President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during the coup attempt appeared in court wearing a similar T-shirt. Several others have also been detained for their choice of clothing.
Turkey says the coup was orchestrated by U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen. Gulen denies the allegations.

The White House’s volatile employment environment
Donald Trump’s White House is unusual in a wide variety of ways, but one of its more bizarre traits is the competing factions that have taken root after just six months in office. Politico reported yesterday that in the West Wing, “top advisers have built up personal staffs to support their own agendas instead of using a traditional White House policy and messaging operation.”
The article added that this dynamic includes staffers, such as Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner, having their own press operations, separate from the White House’s messaging apparatus. Even Republicans concede there is no precedent for anything like this.
The dynamic appears to be an outgrowth of the competing factions within Trump World, which includes a sizable Breitbart contingent, made up of several veterans of the right-wing website: Steve Bannon, Sebastian Gorka, Julia Hahn, and Tera Dahl.
This week, that faction got a little smaller.
As rival factions inside the White House continue to battle over urgent foreign policy decisions, a key ally of Donald Trump’s chief strategist Stephen Bannon is leaving the National Security Council, BuzzFeed News has learned.
Tera Dahl, deputy chief of staff at the NSC and a former columnist for Breitbart, is being reassigned to a position outside of the White House, three people familiar with the decision told BuzzFeed News. The move frees up National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster to install another staffer of his choosing in his drive to reshape the NSC to his liking.
As for the growing list of Trump World departures, we can now update the overall tally. Note, some of the departures were voluntary, some weren’t.
- Michael Flynn, National Security Advisor
- K.T. McFarland, Deputy National Security Advisor
- Monica Crowley, advisor to the National Security Council
- Katie Walsh, Deputy White House Chief of Staff
- Boris Epshteyn, a Special Assistant to the President (he led the White House’s television surrogate operation)
- Andy Puzder, nominee for Labor Secretary
- Vincent Viola, nominee for Army Secretary
- Philip Bilden, nominee for Navy Secretary
- Anthony Scaramucci, White House liaison to the business community
- Shermichael Singleton, Senior Adviser at HUD
- Craig Deare, the NSC’s senior director for Western Hemisphere Affairs
- Marcus Peacock, senior White House budget adviser at OMB
- Todd Ricketts, nominee for Deputy Commerce Secretary
- Mark Green, nominee for Army Secretary
- James Donavan, nominee for Deputy Treasury Secretary
- Mike Dubke, White House communications director
- Tera Dahl, deputy chief of staff at the National Security Council
I suppose we could add former FBI Director James Comey to the list, though he was already at his post when Trump arrived.
Regardless, for a White House team that’s only existed for six months, this represents a rather volatile employment environment.

Politico’s Chief Foreign Affairs Reporter Says Trump Is Worse Than Nixon,"Politico’s chief foreign affairs columnist Susan Glasser said it would be unfair to former President Richard Nixon to compare him to President Donald Trump in an article Monday.
Glasser blasts Trump throughout the piece, claiming he’s worse than Nixon and that the two are an unfair comparison. The article is based on an interview with Elizabeth Drew, known for writing the “Washington Journal,” a diary of how America handled the Nixon investigations in 1973 and 1974 before his impeachment.
Glasser and Drew continued to agree throughout the interview, bringing up Trump’s difficulties as president, although it has only been a little over seven months since he took office.
“Richard Nixon is already the inescapable analogy of the Trump era. And inevitably, the magazine articles and essays, radio talk shows and book lists all mention a single remarkable work: Elizabeth Drew’s Washington Journal,” Glasser wrote. “Six months into Donald Trump’s already embattled presidency, references to the disgraced 37th president are everywhere.”
Glasser mentioned how Nixon and people involved in his scandals have recently been brought back into the spotlight due to the “similarities” between the two presidents.
“Former Watergate prosecutors are suddenly ubiquitous talking heads on cable TV. Google ‘Nixon and Trump’ and more than 14 million references pop up.” Drew’s “Washington Journal” has had an “unlikely renaissance” since Trump, Glasser said.
The president has “has done wonders for that book,” Drew said.
Glasser asked Drew if her book on Nixon was actually relevant to the Trump investigations and discussions of 2016 Russia election hacking.
“Are we right to analogize the tarnished ending of the two-term Nixon presidency—with its historic accomplishments, as well as sordid tapes and long list of criminal convictions—with a chaos-engulfed Trump presidency that has not even been able to staff up, has no significant legislative wins to its name and is already, at just six months in as of this week, the most unpopular in seven decades?” Glasser asked.
“I think we already have an obstruction of justice, certainly as an impeachable offense,” Drew said. Trump “is a running crisis. The crisis is the president and his presidency.” Drew continued, saying Watergate was “not a simple detective story” about a break-in. It was instead a “constitutional crisis” involving “a whole array of abuse of power, where they used the instruments of government against Nixon’s perceived enemies—and he was very good at perceiving enemies.”
Drew said the biggest difference between Trump and Nixon is that Nixon was smarter, “he read books and cared about policy.”

BAT-CRAP CRAZY Nancy Pelosi Giggles in Tough Questions,"by Kayla Adanalian | Jul 19, 2017
 
Nancy Pelosi is goofy.
How she became Speaker of the House remains a mystery. She must have pictures on somebody important.
This woman once said “the word” is her favorite word. That’s cra-cra!
If Pelosi and Hank Johnson married, that child would be named Barack, that is how bat-crap crazy she is.
And if Pelosi weren’t already a laughing stock, she recently offered more proof.
During her weekly press conference, a reporter asked her a question about what she thought about the fact that San Francisco stands to be threatened by aggression from North Korea. And Pelosi giggles as the reporter poses the question to her.
Watch her strange behavior below:
What’s most disturbing is Pelosi had no reason to giggle in the lead up to the question.
I got curious and decided to see if there might be another answer. Sure enough, there is, and it’s medical.
According to PBA.org, Pelosi may have Pseudo-Bulbar Affect.
PBA is a condition that causes uncontrollable crying and/or laughing that happens suddenly and frequently. It can happen in people with a brain injury or certain neurologic conditions.
A person having a PBA crying spell may cry when they don’t feel sad or when they only feel a little bit sad. Someone having a PBA laughing spell may laugh when they don’t feel amused or when they only feel a little bit amused.
Let’s face it, leftism is a brain disorder, and that’s no joke.
Consider that leftism almost got Hillary Cilnton the presidency, and you then know how serious the disorder is. While the Left say global climate change is the number one threat to the world, I disagree. I believe leftism exudes a far bigger threat to humanity.
Check out Pelosi as she honors Refugees International.
She speaks like she’s two sheets into the wind, and still howling from the dog that bit her.
The woman can’t read, she’s mispronouncing words. And if that’s not enough she’s slurring her speech.
And if you think Pelosi is the only sufferer, then you haven’t seen Hillary Clinton.
Check out her PBA that occurred during her Congressional testimony.
Hillary Clinton laughs during questioning about the death of 4 people in Benghazi.
Let’s see who gets the last laugh.

President Donald Trump says he ""did not make"" and doesn't have any recordings of his private conversations with James Comey — his fired FBI director.
Trump also tweets that he has ""no idea"" whether other ""tapes"" or recordings exist.
Trump has disputed Comey's assertion that Trump asked Comey for a pledge of loyalty during a dinner meeting they had.
When news of Comey's account broke, Trump tweeted that Comey ""better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!""
Under a post-Watergate law, presidential recordings belong to the people and eventually can be made public. Destroying them would be a crime.
The House committee investigating Russian meddling in the election set a Friday deadline for the White House to hand over any tapes.

The Perfect Picture Of Socialism,"Venezuela, a Socialist driven country, is going up in flames currently.
There is anarchy running in the streets thanks to the dictator, Nicolas Maduro, trying to hold power in the socialist country. The military in the country fired upon the citizens with tear gas and rubber bullets to try to stop the anarchy. The protest shows no sign of letting up anytime soon. The protests started after Maduro decided to ban one of his opposing potential leaders from running against him for 15 years. Numerous days of protests broke out thanks to this simple action by the dictator. Below are some tweets referencing the protests:

The Supreme Court of Venezuela decided to strip the opposing party of their power. This move was eventually reversed after everything was made public. The corrupt court decision and the protests all became public resulting in the court reversing their decision. The Maduro Regime was extremely cruel to their citizens. The Federalist Papers state:
“As the thousands of protesters approached the headquarters of the state-run oil company, they were met by rubber bullets, eye-scorching tear gas (some of it in a red color, which prompted accusations that they were using chemical weapons against the protesters).”
These actions just go to show how exactly socialism can affect a country. When socialism is in effect you give the government power and when they have power then they can do what ever they want, because there is no one there to keep them in balance. Why let the government-run everything when the people can make the decisions.",DC Statesman,1

Federal authorities announced charges Thursday against 412 physicians, nurses, pharmacists and other medical professionals, in what Attorney General Jeff Sessions called the largest health care fraud enforcement operation in U.S. history.
Sessions said suspects accounted for more than $1.3 billion in fraudulent transactions across more than 20 states, and at least 120 people were charged for their alleged roles in over-prescribing and distributing opioids, making it also the largest-ever opioid-related fraud takedown.
Of the 412 charged in the year-long operation, 56 were physicians.
""Too many trusted medical professionals...have chosen to violate their oaths and put greed ahead of their patients,'' Sessions said. ""Amazingly, some have made their practices into multi-million dollar criminal enterprises.''
A doctor at a Houston clinic is accused of writing 12,000 prescriptions for opioids, enough for more than 2 million illegal doses.
The enforcement effort comes as the country continues to battle a fatal epidemic of prescription drug abuse, much of it involving opioids. Abuse of the expensive painkillers often lead addicts to cheaper and often-lethal alternatives: heroin and fentanyl.
Last year, an estimated 59,000 people in the U.S. died from drug overdoses, many of them linked to opioid abuse, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Casualties are on pace this year to exceed 60,000, Sessions said.
Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe said the overall enforcement operation involved 29 bureau field offices around the country and more than 300 agents.
""The nation is in the midst of a crisis,"" McCabe said. ""Opioid abuse destroys lives.""
McCabe said singled out the doctors, pharmacists and nurses as having violated the personal trust of their patients and clients who depended on them for well-being.
""These people,'' McCabe said, ""inflicted a special kind of damage.''
He said investigators found opioid addicts ""packed in standing-room-only waiting rooms"" at doctors' offices waiting for their prescription painkillers.
""Some doctors were writing more prescriptions than entire hospitals,"" McCabe said.
In one case, a group of six Michigan doctors allegedly operated a scheme to provide patients with unnecessary opioid prescriptions and later billed Medicare for $164 million in false claims. Some of the those prescribed pain-killers, authorities said, were re-sold on the street to addicts.

Police Officer Destroys Hollywood & BLM In Viral Video Exposing The TRUTH,"The police officer accurately explained how indignant is that many people are relativizing Familia’s assassination by saying that Bonds was just a victim of the system.
One of the most extraordinary phenomenons of the internet is definitely viral videos, given the fact that in addition to gaining lot of attention, it has become the most efficient way to criticize or point out certain issue. Fortunately, the newest viral video that is making the rounds of the internet, is aiming at leftist hypocrisy.
In this video, an unnamed police offer calls out professional athletes, Hollywood celebrities, and especially Black Lives Matter activists for their deafening silence on the brutal assassination of New York City cop, and mother of three Miosotis Familia, last week by an alleged anti-cop extremist.
She was shot in the head while sitting in a marked police vehicle by 34-year-old-parolee Alexander Bonds, who reportedly had a history of expressing anti-police views. This included a highly vulgar video rant posted on his Facebook account, where he threatened police officers to stay away from him.
I do not know who this officer is but his words are the words that should be spoken by all our elected officials. pic.twitter.com/gLzO0oibCU
— SBA (@SBANYPD) 8 de julio de 2017
In his 11-minutes rant, Bonds claimed that he cannot understand why black people (he used the N word repeatedly) are so reluctant to want to say something to police officers. Additionally, he insulted them and warned they should keep their distance from him.
Regarding this tragedy, the unnamed officer in his heated video rant asked where the outrage and indignation is over the targeting and murder of a police officer who was doing her job, serving the people of New York City. The officer also asked where’s the thirst for justice from those who protest police shootings of criminals.
The police officer went further and asked “where the hell” are Hollywood celebrities and sports teams wearing NYPD clothes. He also asked where’s the “hand’s up don’t shoot people” and Black Lives Matter activists.
Officer Familia was shot in the head while sitting in a marked police vehicle by 34-year-old-parolee Alexander Bonds, who reportedly had a history of expressing anti-police views.
In one part of his video he explained he could never understand why is it every career criminal and every thug gets full attention when they’re shot and killed for threatening others, victimizing people, and breaking the law. In addition, he pointed out the irony that represents how these people become famous and their families millionaires when they are justifiably shot by the police.
The police officer accurately explained how indignant it is that many people are relativizing Familia’s assassination by saying that Bonds was just a victim of the system, when the officer he killed was a mother that was just sitting in a “gang-infested” precinct before he cowardly shot her in the head.
He also expressed his displeasure of how many don’t care about this kind of situation by saying that’s the police’s job, and that people know the risks when they choose this career. He claimed these assertions don’t make sense because it doesn’t eliminate the fact that she was the mother of three children who went to work and never got back home.
Officer Familia is survived by her 12-year-old twin son and daughter, her 20-year-old daughter, and her 86-year-old mother, whom she cared for.
After saying these stone cold truths, the unnamed officer claimed he can’t see or hear celebrities protesting about this terrible incident. However, he pointed out that even when they remain silent every time a police officer is killed by someone who believes in the anti-cop narrative, people can see that reality. Given this fact, he called celebrities and activists to break their silence and do the right thing and support the police.
Officer Familia is survived by her 12-year-old twin son and daughter, her 20-year-old daughter, and her 86-year-old mother, whom she cared for. On Tuesday, thousands of police officers were gathering to honor slain Officer Familia at the Grand Concourse in the Bronx.
Nevertheless, this event was terribly interrupted for several minutes after a teenager played the NWA song “F*** Tha Police” out his apartment window. He justified his action by claiming police officers killed his older brother and best friend without cause.
At the funeral, hundreds of NYPD officers snubbed New York Major Bill De Blasio in a show of protest over his controversial decision to go to Germany last week in the immediate aftermath of Familia´s assassination.
About 20 NYPD officers went to his apartment to ask him to turn off the music. The kid eventually turned off the song only after the building supervisor threatened to kick his family out of the apartment.
At the funeral, hundreds of NYPD officers snubbed New York Major Bill De Blasio in a show of protest over his controversial decision to go to Germany last week in the immediate aftermath of Familia’s assassination.
During his unannounced trip, the Democratic NYC Mayor spoke at a protest against the then ongoing G-20 summit in Hamburg. In one of the rarest moments in U.S. politics, de Blasio used his appearance at the anti-establishment demonstration to laud his police force.
This controversial trip meant that he missed a vigil for the officer, which outraged NYC residents and caught the attention of President Trump, who brutally criticized him through his Twitter account.

MSNBC Counterterrorism Analyst ‘Nominates’ Trump Tower For Suicide Bombing Target,"Home NEWS  
 
MSNBC counterterrorism analyst Malcolm Nance just crossed every line when he called for ISIS to blow up Trump Tower. At least, that’s what it seemed he said, as interpreted by many angry patriots throughout the country.
Nance tweeted a photo of the Trump Tower in Istanbul, with the caption,
“This is my nominee for first ISIS suicide bombing of a Trump property.”
This seems like a suggestion, right? Even a proposal or a calling! Sick!
“Trump Tower Istanbul,” Nance continued. “After seeing Trump’s congrats to Erdogan for winning his RIGGED election I’m worried our FP [foreign policy] is directed by property.”
Americans all over the country were outraged. Even some of Nance’s fans warned him that he had taken things too far.
“Be careful. It sounds like you’re encouraging it. They’ll jump all over that,” one Twitter user wrote.
Not surprisingly, Nance quickly deleted the post, reports American News. But the damage was already done.
This is just more evidence that MSNBC has it out for President Trump. Because of their hateful policy, a group of conservatives led by Brent Bozell, president of the Media Research Center, and a new group called Media Equalizer, have decided to fight against this behavior.
They launched highly-organized campaigns to threaten boycotts against advertisers who sponsor all of these Hate Programs on CNN and MSNBC – the shows devoted 24/7 to destroying President Trump with wild-eyed conspiracies.
“[W]e will be publicly listing the advertisers of these programs and asking them to defend their decision to continue airing ads on these shows,” Bozell said in his statement. “Every time one of their on-air personalities go beyond political commentary and engage in smear and hate, we are going to unleash an army of activists to contact these advertisers by phone and through social media to ask them why they are advertising on programs that are so biased, repulsive and morally bankrupt.”

Turkey angered by German protest artwork ahead of G20 summit,"Updated 11:31 AM ET, Wed July 5, 2017

An art installation by the Center for Political Beauty is seen in front of the German Chancellor's office in Berlin on 3 July.
(CNN)Turkey has condemned an activist art installation in Berlin that portrayed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was portrayed as a dictator, shortly before he was due to arrive in Germany for the G20 summit.
The work, in front of the German Chancellery, featured a banner with the faces of Erdogan, Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz next to a sporty-looking black Mercedes, with the words ""Do you want this car? Kill dictatorship.""
It was staged Monday afternoon by an activist art collective, the Center for Political Beauty, known for its provocative -- but peaceful -- ""interventions"" on humanitarian themes.
Walking hundreds of miles to protest Erdogan
Walking hundreds of miles to protest Erdogan 01:40
Turkey's Foreign Ministry condemned what it said was ""a new example of rising racism and xenophobia in the country"" and urged Germany to take ""all necessary measures"" over the incident.
""The wording on the banner is a direct call for violence targeting the lives of the leaders whose photos are depicted on it,"" a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement said. ""The fact that the German Police did not intervene in the matter despite their presence at the venue makes this incident even more grave.""
The row comes at a time of strained relations between Turkey and Germany. German Chancellor Angela Merkel in March questioned Turkey's commitment to democracy and the rule of law, while Erdogan suggested Germany's Nazi past might not be entirely behind it.
Asked about the Berlin incident at a government press conference on Wednesday, German Foreign Ministry spokesman Rainer Breul said: ""We have received a protest note from the Turkish Embassy that expressed anger about this particular action.""
The art installation, seen Monday, was staged to coincide with the G20 summit this week.
Philipp Ruch, artistic director for the Center for Political Beauty, told CNN the art installation had been staged to coincide with this week's G20 summit in Hamburg.
""The message that we want to give is (that) dictatorship is not welcome in Germany,"" he said. ""We have a big past with autocracy and totalitarianism and we absolutely know from our own history that it shouldn't be tolerated.""
Ruch highlighted concerns over the treatment of journalists and opposition activists in Turkey, many of whom have been imprisoned following a crackdown by the authorities in the wake of last year's attempted coup. The provocative message on the banner is meant to inspire debate, he said.
Thousands trek in 'Justice March' from Ankara to Istanbul
Ruch said the German authorities had not responded to the Turkish government's request for action against the group, adding that post-war Germany had a strong tradition of freedom of expression.
""This is a democracy and a state with the rule of law, and this is what I really love about our country as an artist,"" he said.
The Center for Political Beauty also staged a leaflet drop Friday in Istanbul's Gezi Park as an act of ""resistance,"" Ruch said. The text of the leaflet, written in Turkish by Turks living in Germany, was the result of a competition staged by the collective.
It urged readers to resist Erdogan's government, saying ""Defend the democracy. Fight against racism. Bring the dictatorship down.""

Trump Lashes Out At Report That He Doesn’t Understand Details Of The Senate Healthcare Bill,"President Trump was up bright and early on Wednesday, blasting the New York Times for questioning his grasp of the details of the Senate healthcare bill.

Why Are Fake Time Magazine Covers Displayed in Trump Golf Clubs?
Trump’s lashing out would be amusing, if the issue wasn’t one that held serious implications for the nation.
The specific problem he has is with a New York Times piece on Tuesday that suggested even the senators who support the bill don’t have full confidence in the president’s grasp of the details.
The New York Times reported that a senator left a White House meeting Tuesday with the feeling that the president didn’t fully understand some basic parts of the plan, citing an aide who received a detailed readout of the exchange.
The senator felt Trump “seemed especially confused” after a moderate Republican said those who were against the bill would say it appeared to be a “massive tax break for the wealthy,” according to The Times.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) after the White House meeting ignored a question regarding Trump’s command of the details of the negotiations and smiled blandly, the newspaper noted.
In other words, Trump’s support of this propping up of Obamacare is just bandwagon jumping by Trump. He’s trusting the majority of GOP senators who are pushing the bill.
The huddle came as one GOP strategist with close ties to the White House told The Hill that Trump had not yet fully engaged with the effort to pass a bill in the upper chamber.
He’s just there for the photo-ops, folks.

Clash Poll: Court Upholds Ban On Full Face Burkas – Do You Agree?,"Published on July 11, 2017
 
Is this an idea whose time has come? Or is it ‘Islamophobic’ and insensitive?
Courts in Europe (yes, Europe!) have upheld Belgium’s ban on wearing the full-face Niqab in public.
The court ruled that the restriction sought to guarantee social cohesion, the ‘protection of the rights and freedoms of others’ and that it was ‘necessary in a democratic society’.
Belgium banned the wearing of the full-face veil under a June 2011 law. It prohibits appearing in public ‘with a face masked or hidden, in whole or in part, in such a way as to be unidentifiable’.
Violations can result in fines and up to seven days in jail.
France was the first European country to ban the niqab in April 2011. –Read More
Why should the law prevent someone from covering their face like that?
Maybe it had something to do with stories like this one:
One dull afternoon in late autumn, a 27-year-old British man of Somali origin, with uneven teeth and chubby cheeks, became the latest terror suspect to disappear, making a mockery of the UK security services, police and judiciary.
After spending several hours in the dilapidated An-Noor Masjid (mosque) and community centre on Church Road in Acton, west London, he sliced off his electronic tag, slipped on a burka and vanished.
The fugitive had been subject to a controversial Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure (Tpim) notice, which was supposed to restrict his movements.
A senior leader of an Al Qaeda-linked terror group has been captured dressed up like a Muslim woman – wearing a garment which is a headpiece and covers the body, too, known as a burka.
So, it’s not exactly a rare thing. And strictly speaking, their religion does not require covered faces. Even Muslim countries, before they’ve been taken over by radicals, didn’t wear full coverings. Look up old pictures of Iran, or other repressive Hellholes BEFORE they became oppressive.
WATCH: Viral Video Shows BEFORE And AFTER Sharia — It’s SHOCKING!
The court ruled on this one. Did they make the right call?
And should WE be considering laws like that HERE? Let us know in the comments.

Since Trump was voted in on November 8th, the media has spread this narrative that Russia tried to “meddle” with the election. President Trump believes Hillary Clinton, The Democratic Party, and the liberal media are trying to delegitimize him by implying some foreign power helped elect him. Trump is sick of the media hysteria, and says that many countries ALWAYS are trying to influence our elections and others.
Well, Michael Caputo, Bill Clinton’s former adviser, just admitted something to Tucker Carlson that proves Trump is right.
First, Caputo admitted that he was sent by President Clinton on a top secret operation to influence the Russian elections in 1993. He pointed out that Russia and America always try to have influence in the other countries politics, so NOTHING is new about what happened in 2016.
Then, Caputo shot down the “lie” that Russia wanted Trump to win. Caputo says that the Kremlin actually wanted Hillary to win because she is so predictable, while Trump will keep them on their toes. WATCH the video then SHARE on Facebook so we can make it go viral!

"Ronda Rousey tells what happened when she found the ‘little punks’ that squatted in her house, stole her guns","July 5, 2017 | Frieda Powers | Print Article
UFC legend Ronda Rousey recounted how “little punks” vandalized her home and stole her valuables before her fiance caught up with them.
The former women’s bantamweight champion was set to leave for New Zealand and stopped at her house with fiance Travis Browne when they discovered what had happened, Rousey recalled on “Live with Kelly and Ryan” on Wednesday.

— MMA Alley (@MMAAlley) July 5, 2017
“We stopped by the house right before we were going to go to the airport and he was going to sneak away and go ask my mom for permission,” she said, explaining how Browne, a fellow UFC fighter, was going to ask her mother for permission to propose to Rousey while in New Zealand. He never got the chance.
“Right when we got to the house, we realized we were robbed,” Rousey said in her first interview since her December loss to bantamweight champion Amanda Nunes at UFC 207.
“Someone had been squatting in my house for like three days, sleeping in my bed,” she said, adding that the thieves “stole my Olympic rings, stole my guns, stole all my precious jewelry, every headphone in the house, credit cards.”
But, thanks to security cameras in her home, it wasn’t long before the couple discovered who the culprits were.
“We have security cameras so we looked back at them and we saw that they were a bunch of kids with skateboards and there’s a famous skate park right across the street cause we’re in Venice,” Rousey said. “So my man’s six-foot-seven, like 260 [pounds], he like beelines it straight to the skateboard park, finds the guys right away.”
“He’s smart enough not to [hit them], we’ll get sued pretty hard, but he found the police right then and they caught them,” she added.
The mixed martial arts star, who has been coaching on the new season of ABC’s “Battle of the Network Stars,” did not say whether she got her possessions back but was sure her home was targeted.
“They knew it was my house,” Rousey said. “There’s no way you can’t not know it’s my house. What little punks.”
“I wish five minutes with me was a sentence,” Rousey said. “But I think that would go under cruel and unusual punishment.”
Rousey had to deal with another act of vandalism on her house in January when it was spray painted with graffiti.
As for the New Zealand trip, it went off without a hitch and Browne ended up popping the question as he had planned.

"[WATCH] Pastor Claims Praying For Trump Is “Heresy”, Instantly Gets Crushed By Real Christians","In a ridiculous segment, MSNBC brought a Christian pastor on air to argue that praying for President Trump is “heresy.” The comment was made after a photograph was released of the Commander in Chief with religious leaders putting their hands on him in prayer.
Rev. Dr. William Barber, a pastor of Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina and a member of the national board of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People spoke out against the photo.
“When you can P-R-A-Y for a president and others while they are P-R-E-Y, preying on the most vulnerable, you’re violating the sacred principles of religion,” Barber told MSNBC’s Joy Reid. “What leaders ought to be doing is challenging the president, challenging McConnell, and challenging Ryan, and challenging these senators and others and not trying to appease them. Instead, they’re acting like priests of the empire rather than prophets of God.”
Of course, his comments are completely ridiculous. Christian leader Johnnie Moore completely disagrees with the ‘expert’ MSNBC hired to push their agenda.
“We believe we are a praying nation, and we begin by praying for our leaders,” Moore said.

Republican Senator Murkowski won’t back ‘repeal-only’ health bill,"18 Jul 2017 at 13:09 ET
Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story!
A third Republican U.S. senator on Tuesday said she could not back any legislation to repeal Obamacare without a replacement plan, effectively blocking Republican leaders’ efforts to bring up a narrower repeal-only bill after earlier legislation collapsed.
“To repeal there has to be a replacement. There’s enough chaos already, and this would just contribute to it,” Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told reporters, saying she would vote no on any effort to take up legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010 under former President Barack Obama.

How Republican governors could kill the GOP's health-care bill,"This post, originally published in June, has been updated with the latest news.
Behind a significant number of GOP senators who oppose their party's health-care bill is a governor who also hates it.
Of the 13 GOP senators who have concerns about or don't support the new version of the legislation, eight of their state's governors also don't support it. That's several more governors voicing their opposition since we last checked in June.
An additional three of those governors conspicuously won't comment on it, or, in the case of Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin (R), they begrudgingly support it. (It's “not a really good bill,” Bevin recently said.)
All but two of these governors are Republican or Republican-leaning. (Alaska Gov. Bill Walker is an independent who says he's “very concerned” about the bill.)
In other words, Republicans' health-care bill isn't popular with a significant number of Republicans who would have to vote for it, and isn't popular with a significant number of Republicans who would have to implement it.
How governors feel about this legislation can make or break whether the bill can pass.
Republican senators who are on the fence about Senate Republicans' health-care bill will have a hard time voting for it if their governor back home doesn't support it.
Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), who has become a bellwether opposition figure, is a perfect example. He announced he opposed the first version of the legislation in a news conference alongside GOP Gov. Brian Sandoval, the most popular politician in the state and a huge proponent of keeping the Medicaid expansion.
“If you want my support (on repealing Obamacare) … you better make sure that the Republican governors that have expanded Medicaid sign off on it,” Heller said.
[Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval still doesn't support the Senate's health-care bill]
Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (D) traveled to D.C. in June and held a news conference to urge Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) to go from undecided to a “no” vote on the bill. “Trust me, by hook or by crook I will get a hold of him before there’s any vote,” Hickenlooper dramatically declared. “I’ll go camp out on his doorstep if I have to.”
(The New York Times reports that Gardner called Hickenlooper “literally 30 seconds” later. Gardner still hasn't taken a position on the new bill.)
Alongside Hickenlooper was Gov. John Kasich (R-Ohio), who has been one of the most outspoken — and quotable — Republicans opposed to this bill.
“They think that's great? That's good public policy?” Kasich said of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimate that the first version of the bill would lead to 22 million more people — the equivalent of the population of 16 states — uninsured over the next decade. “Are you kidding me?”
The same afternoon, Sen. Rob Portman, Ohio's only Republican senator, more or less agreed: “I continue to have real concerns about the Medicaid policies in this bill,” Portman said in a statement announcing his opposition, “especially those that impact drug treatment at a time when Ohio is facing an opioid epidemic.”
These Republican governors aren't suddenly pro-Obamacare. They're concerned getting rid of a health-care law that has insured some 20 million will cost their states money that, in many cases, they don't have. The definition of rolling back Obamacare is to unwind the federal government's contribution to people's health care. That leaves state government with two politically unpopular decisions. As I wrote in May after House Republicans passed their version:
States are probably going to be on the hook for billions of dollars of health-care costs, especially for the poor and sick. That means these governors will have some tough choices to make: Do you find a way to raise taxes/cut other services to keep your most vulnerable population insured? Or do you just stop insuring them?
Democrats hoping to pick up governor's mansions are hoping this Senate health-care bill becomes a campaign issue for GOP gubernatorial candidates as much as it's become a budget issue.
Democrats' governors association launched a tracker of where top GOP governor candidates are on the bill. It's also paying for a digital video ad in six states trying to pin down Republican governor hopefuls. At the top of the list is Republicans' nominee in Virginia's governor's race later this year, Ed Gillespie:
Image from Democratic Governors' Association's digital ad.
All that's to say: When it comes to debating health care, GOP governors are pinched financially. Some of them could be boxed in politically. And the more of them oppose their party's attempt to change Obamacare, the less likely Republicans will actually change Obamacare.",Washington Post – Politics,0

"Trump's argument against transgender soldiers echoes one used against gays, women and blacks","President Trump announced that transgender troops would not be allowed to serve in the military on July 26, reversing the Pentagon's 2016 decision to lift the ban. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)
Seemingly out of the blue on Wednesday morning, President Trump took to Twitter to announce that he would not allow “Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.” The rationale? The military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.”
The question of costs — presumably referring to procedures like gender reassignment surgery — was addressed in a Rand report that estimated a 0.04- to 0.13-percent increase in military health-care expenditures should transgender people be allowed to serve. Trump has proposed a 10 percent bump in overall military spending, which could certainly absorb that increase.
That latter point, though, the “disruption” that integration of transgender troops would spur? That is an argument we’ve heard before. When gay Americans sought the right to serve in the military, that was a central argument against the change. When women sought combat roles, a central argument. When blacks were integrated into the military? Warnings about disruption.
In 1948, President Harry Truman moved toward fully integrating black Americans into the military. At the time, members of his own party spoke out against the plan. The Washington Post reported on the objections in June of that year.
Former Tennessee U.S. senator Tom Stewart proposed “allowing men in the services to choose whether or not they would serve in mixed units” to avoid offending the sensibilities of those determined to maintain segregation. U.S. Sen. Lister Hill of Alabama argued that integration would “seriously impair the morale of the Army at a time when our armed forces should be at their strongest and most efficient.” He called Truman’s move “unfortunate.”
When the Democrats adopted an end-military-segregation platform, a contingent of Southern Democrats splintered off into a pro-segregation party known as the Dixiecrats. Strom Thurmond, running as a States Rights Democratic Party candidate while still nominally a Democrat, carried four Southern states in that year’s presidential election.
Gen. Omar Bradley, the Army chief of staff in 1948, argued that the Army should follow the American people on rejecting segregation, not lead it. For that, he was praised, including by New York Times columnist Hanson Baldwin.
“Most important of all,” Baldwin wrote of Bradley’s comments, “is the efficiency of the Army, of which morale is a part. This is General Bradley’s particular responsibility. He knows, as nearly every Army officer knows, after long experience with the problem, that a hard, flat and inflexible rule that white and Negro manpower be completely intermingled immediately in all tactical units would be one of the surest ways to break down the morale of the Army and to destroy its efficiency.”
For what it’s worth, there were about 62,000 black soldiers in the Army in 1948, about a tenth of the total. Rand estimates that there are between 1,000 and 7,000 transgender service members on active duty today, of 1.3 million in total. (A transgender organization puts the number at 15,000.)
In the 1990s, the argument shifted to the role of women in the military. That year, Lou Marano wrote a piece for this paper arguing against allowing women to serve in combat roles.
“It is also said that sexual distraction in military life is an issue only for relics like me, and that today’s more enlightened generation of young men develop nothing but brotherly affection for their female ‘buddies,'” he wrote. “Not only does this go against all experience and common sense, but I found it to be false when reporting on U.S. forces deployed to the mountains of Honduras in 1988. … Human nature doesn’t change, and we are asking for trouble by pretending it has.”
The physiology of female soldiers also played a prominent role in the debate. Newt Gingrich, splitting time between serving as Speaker of the House and teaching a history course at Reinhardt College in 1995, told his students that women wouldn’t be able to handle certain combat realities.
“Females,” he said, “have biological problems staying in a ditch for 30 days because they get infections, and they don’t have upper body strength.” Men, on the other hand, like to roll around in filth, he said.
A 1997 bill aimed at segregating men and women in basic training was championed by members of Congress like Roscoe Bartlett (R-Md.).
“During the brief period of time when they’re being socialized into the ethos of the military, it’s counterproductive to have men and women train together,” he told the Times that year. ”The attraction and distraction of sexuality is detracting from the effectiveness of basic training.” Others pointed out that teaching men and women how to serve together at the outset would alleviate problems later on.
This point comes up over and over, even today: Men will simply be too distracted by women for them to serve alongside one another. A Google search for “women in military distraction” yields 857,000 results.
26,000 unreported sexual assults in the military-only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2013
The 1997 bill barring boot-camp integration prompted an unusual flip side to the argument from Col. Vincent J. Inghilterra, a chaplain at Fort Leonard Wood.
“Because of the rigors of [basic training] and the physiological limitations of female recruits to meet the fitness demands,” he wrote in a letter to lawmakers, “some may be tempted to use their sexuality to garner special favors.”
The boot-camp bill also had the support of then-U. S. senator Daniel Coats, now serving as Trump’s director of national intelligence. When Coats was put forward as a possible nominee to serve as George W. Bush’s defense secretary, that history of opposition to integrating women more fully into the armed forces was raised by activists opposing his nomination. (The job eventually went to Donald H. Rumsfeld.)
Coats’s nomination was similarly opposed by those advocating for an expanded role of gays in the military, also a subject that was debated in the 1990s. Again, a similar argument emerged.
“The problem of having homosexuals serve openly,” a retired Army colonel said during a hearing on the issue in 1993, “is the extent to which it becomes a divisive cleavage point in small units.”
Another expert testified that the “introduction of sexual attraction,” in the words of Coats, “destroys” military cohesion. “I think we have seen this happen on a heterosexual basis in units in which erotic love between a leader and a soldier has been introduced,” said David Marlowe, the chief of military psychology at Walter Reed.

— andrew kaczynski (@KFILE) July 26, 2017
As recently as 2010, when don’t-ask-don’t-tell was being repealed, Gen. James Amos, commandant of the Marine Corps, echoed a variation of the same line: Gay soldiers could lead to combat deaths.
“When your life hangs on the line,” he said, “you don’t want anything distracting. … Mistakes and inattention or distractions cost Marines’ lives.”
When the bill was passed, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) lamented the decision, echoing Amos. “Today’s a very sad day,” he said. “The commandant of the United States Marine Corps says when your life hangs on the line, you don’t want anything distracting. … I don’t want to permit that opportunity to happen and I’ll tell you why. You go up to Bethesda Naval Hospital, Marines are up there with no legs, none. You’ve got Marines at Walter Reed with no limbs.”
Despite all of these warnings, President Trump himself has regularly weighed in on how the military has emerged from these integrations: the best. “Having the best technology and equipment is only one part of the American military dominance,” he said this weekend in Norfolk.
He continued. “Our true strength is our people. Our greatest weapon is all of you. Our nation endures because we have citizens who love America and who are willing to fight for America.”

Keith Olbermann: Trump Should Be Impeached After Tweeting CNN Takedown Video,"Former MSNBC television host and liberal commentator Keith Olbermann sent out a tweet Sunday morning calling for President Trump to be impeached after the president posted a video of himself beating CNN in a wrestling match on Twitter.
“Please RT if you agree the cabinet must invoke the 25th Amendment, TODAY, and immediately remove @realDonaldTrump from the presidency,” Olbermann wrote.

Trump tweeted the video of himself taking down someone whose face is replaced with a CNN logo Sunday morning with the caption “#FraudNewsCNN #FNN.”
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 2, 2017
At the end of the video, the letters FNN appear with the words “fraud news network” directly underneath them.
The video meme is taken from an event in 2007 where Trump bodyslammed WWE Chairman and CEO Vince McMahon at Wrestlemania XXII.
Various Trump supporters edited the video to show the president tackling his many foes, including CNN.
Liberals, including Olbermann, were not amused by the meme. In his tweet, Olbermann referred to the efforts by congressional Democrats to deem Trump “mentally unfit” to serve as president so they can pass a bill that would allow Congress remove him from office under the 25th Amendment.
The 25th Amendment, ratified in 1967 shortly after President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, addresses the issue of what to do when a president becomes unable to perform his presidential duties. It allows the vice president to assume the presidency in case the president resigns or the cabinet removes him from office because he is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.”
Olbermann has called for Trump to be impeached several times within 24 hours.
The first time, Olbermann alleged that Trump “attacked freedom of speech” and called for his impeachment:
So @realDonaldTrump has just attacked freedom of speech in an Independence Day speech. Impeach him, indict him, imprison him, erase his name https://t.co/w5A6oxJYYS
— Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) July 2, 2017
Then, he tweeted that the vice president and the cabinet should use the 25th Amendment to get Trump to resign:

"SEE IT: Trump Hosts ‘Secret’ Guests At White House, Photo Reveals Who They Really Are","admin News, Politics, U.SLeave a comment
A photograph released by the White House last week shows two guests who President Donald Trump recently hosted. Their true identities have now been revealed, but the media has remained tight-lipped about who they really are and where they’re from.
Normally, the White House will choose a “Photo of the Day” in order to let the public know what has been happening inside the People’s House. Last Wednesday, the image chosen showed two girls, Joy Bishara and Lydia Pogu.
Bishara and Pogu were two of the 276 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok in Nigeria who were captured by Boko Haram extremists in 2014. They were ultimately able to escape by jumping off of a moving truck that the terrorists were using to transport them, but many others were not as lucky.
One hundred and thirteen Chibok girls are still being held captive by Boko Haram in Nigeria. The terrorists released 82 of the girls in May after more than three years of captivity. The group also released 21 of the abducted schoolgirls in October 2016. One student escaped with her baby in May 2016.
Bishara and Pogu were accompanied on their White House visit by Doug Wead, who appears in the photo on the far left, alongside his wife Myriam. Wead, an author and former assistant to President George H.W. Bush, is the president of Canyonville Christian Academy, the boarding school in Canyonville, Oregon, which Bishara and Pogu recently graduated from.
Wead was an assistant to President George H.W. Bush and has published many books, including Game of Thorns: The Inside Story of Hillary Clinton’s Failed Campaign and Donald Trump’s Winning Strategy. He told NPR that Ivanka Trump reached out to him after his appearance on a BBC program about presidential children. The two got in touch via email and kept in contact.
Wead asked her if she wanted to meet the girls because of her concern about human trafficking. She said “absolutely,” Wead says. [Source: NPR]
“I enjoyed [the visit], it was wonderful,” said Bishara. “Her [Ivanka’s] work is a really good one, at least she’s helping people around the world who have been hurt.”
Trump did not alert the media that this meeting was taking place; he didn’t publicize the sit-down, and the press was not invited. In other words, he is committed to helping those in need whether or not it earns him positive publicity.
Nevertheless, you would think that the media would have picked up the story after it was exposed via the White House “Photo of the Day,” yet have you heard anything about this on CNN or MSBNC? I didn’t think so.
The media is refusing to report this story because it proves that Donald Trump is doing good things, not just for our own country but for oppressed people from around the world, and that he cares about women and children. Coincidentally, though, when Michelle Obama held up a piece of printer paper with the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls written on it in a fruitless attempt to free the girls held captive by Boko Haram, the press leaped to cover the story.
Of course, Michelle’s hashtag campaign never actually saved any girls. She never met with any survivors of the terrorist group’s brutalities at the White House, either. Still, she was lauded by the media as if she had just cured cancer and solved world hunger in the same day, all without ever doing anything of actual substance.
It truly is remarkable how the media fails to recognize their own overwhelming bias when it seems as clear as day to the rest of us. Sadly, legitimate journalism is all but dead in the United States.",Nevo News,1
"WATCH: Peyton Manning Destroys Jimmy Kimmel, Goes On Epic Pro-Trump Rant","admin News, Politics, U.SLeave a comment
Late night television hosts are in a race to the bottom with CNN anchors.
Retired quarterback, Peyton Manning, recently appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live to defend his decision to play golf with President Trump. Manning stated that it would have been “almost un-American” to turn down the President.
It is a depressing sign of the times that the former quarterback even had to defend his decision to play golf with the president. The offer alone should be considered a tremendous honor to any American.
Manning defended himself, saying, “I heard Arnold Palmer say one time if the President of the United States ever asks you to play golf, you do it, it’s a no-brainer.”
“We had 30 golf carts behind us. Felt safe, but he was a great host. He loves sports. And we passed through a number of groups. He was very gracious. He took a picture with groups that we passed through.” Manning explained.
During the interview, it is clear that Kimmel was attempting to bait Manning into insulting President Trump, but the football star refused.
Kimmel asked Manning if Trump cheated–an effort to insinuate that he is a dishonest person. However, President Trump would not need to cheat. He is an excellent golfer.
Kimmel’s constant attempts to bait Manning into insulting the President reveals the sick reliance the mainstream media has on President Trump. Discussing President Trump is an easy way to guarantee ratings, but insulting the President alienates half of the audience.
As a result, we witness almost near uniformity among the mainstream media attacking President Trump. These hosts are forced to talk about the President for ratings, but they are not allowed to say anything good about him. As a result, our media has taken to non-stop attacks against President Trump.
While this may help with ratings in the short term, the strategy will ultimately destroy the credibility of the mainstream media.
As President Trump continues to achieve his agenda, and as Americans continue to hear the President speak for himself, more people will come to support him. Soon, all Americans will understand the depths of the media’s dishonesty.",Nevo News,1
ILLEGAL Immigrant Whines On National TV: Donald Trump Is a THREAT TO WAY OF LIFE in “OUR” Communities,"July 21, 2017Natalie D.0 Views 0 CommentsDeportation, Greisa Martinez, Illegal Immigrant, MSNBC
One of President-elect Donald Trump’s most oft-repeated promises on the campaign trail was that he would make our country great again and he will deport millions of illegal immigrants who were living in the United States. Now, that Donald Trump is the president-elect, it’s clear that he is wasting no time to put that plan into action.
But as you can guess, those illegal immigrants are not so happy because of this.
Greisa Martinez, the director of the United We Dream Network, appeared on MSNBC to tell America that Republican President Donald Trump is “a threat to the way of life in our communities.” During the interview, she stated that President Trump’s policy of deportation of millions of illegal immigrants is a concern to our country!
Martinez said: “For people like myself that are undocumented and have undocumented family members, it’s been clear from day one that he wants to enact mass deportation. He wants to deport me and my mother. That is crystal clear for all of us. But this in and out and softening or not is just erratic behavior and concerning to our country.”
“As someone whose father was deported eight years ago, I understand the pain that brings to communities. But Donald Trump wants to make something that’s already bad and toxic and make it worse. He has promised to increase the force by triple in the community. He has promised to deport people like myself and my families and U.S. citizen children along with them. So I think that Donald Trump is a threat to the way of life in our communities,”- she added.
I don’t understand how so many people, who have lived here illegally for many years, are now so irate and upset that illegals have to go home. Why didn’t you do anything about getting your documents in order all those years? You violated your temporary visa if you even had one, and the laws of our country. It’s just not the way it works. Makes me annoyed to hear so much nonsense by offenders of our laws.
We have news for her. The majority of American voters sincerely hope that President Donald Trump will threaten her life all the way to deportation. They will vote for Trump in 2020 so that he can finish the job.
Thanks for pointing out you are undocumented. Guess what you have won an All expense paid trip back to where you came from.

German police say attacker fled supermarket in Barmbek district before being tackled by passersby and arrested

Friday 28 July 2017 19.29 EDTFirst published on Friday 28 July 2017 12.45 EDT
One person has been stabbed to death in a Hamburg supermarket and six people have been injured after being attacked by a man wielding a knife.
German police said the suspected attacker fled the shop in the Barmbek district of the north German city and headed towards a metro station, but was followed by witnesses who tackled him to the ground. The man was then arrested by plainclothes police officers. He was slightly injured.
The suspect was a 26-year-old born in the United Arab Emirates, police said, though they were still working to establish his nationality. Hamburg’s mayor said the man had apparently sought shelter in Germany and that authorities had been unable to deport him because he had no papers.
The person who was killed was described by police as a customer of the shop and believed to be a 50-year-old German man. One of the six victims injured in the attack is in a serious condition.
Timo Zill, a spokesman for Hamburg police, said: “What we know at this stage is that the person was male, that he was armed with a knife, and entered the supermarket, and sought out his victims and started stabbing them randomly. He’s injured but not seriously.”
Zill said he had no information as to the man’s motive. “First reports about a possible robbery cannot be confirmed so far,” he said.
Police said they were confident he had been acting alone. One witness described his weapon as a kitchen knife.
Two witnesses to the attack said the man shouted “Allahu Akbar” but police said they were unable to confirm the reports. They declined to say whether the attack was being treated as a terrorist incident.
Bild newspaper reported late on Friday that armed police forces had searched the migrant housing centre where the attacker had lived.
A police spokeswoman said the motive for the attack was still under investigation. She said she had no information that the attacker was known to authorities as an Islamist, as reported by the newspaper Tagesspiegel.
Police said a 50-year-old woman and four men aged between 19 and 64 were injured in the attack, all of whom were German. A 35-year-old Turkish man was injured while trying to stop the attacker, they said. Media reports said he injured his shoulder while throwing a metal rod.",The Guardian – World,0

Tsunami advisory canceled after Russia 7.8 earthquake,"July 17, 2017 8:20 PM
 
A strong earthquake on the Russian side of the Bering Sea briefly prompted a tsunami advisory for parts of the Pacific, including Alaska's remote Aleutian Islands and Russia. The National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, canceled the advisory because the tsunami no longer posed a threat.
Officials at the warning center had cautioned waves could reach up to 3 feet (0.91 meters) above the tide level. But waves later Monday were reported only 6 inches above tide at the sparsely populated Shemya, Alaska, site of a remote Air Force station in the extreme western Aleutians.
The quake was initially measured at magnitude 7.4 when it struck just after 3:30 p.m. AKDT in the Komandorskiye Ostrova region of Russian, roughly 1,400 miles (2,253 kilometers) east of Anchorage.

"Liberal Reporter Claims Cop Threatened And Targeted Him For Sick Reason, Then Cops Released This Video","This has to be the feel-good story of the week!
I think now I have seen it all. A white newspaper “fake news” reporter from Missouri has set off a barrage of controversy after he published a fake opinion piece last month attacking Missouri sheriff’s deputies for pulling him over after he made multiple traffic violations.
According to Bill Clark’s column, he was pulled over for failing to signal at a stop sign, which he does often. That in its self is not news, but since the mainstream media now makes up news we all can imagine what happened next. Clark went on to write that he was lucky he didn’t get shot and that his very life seemed to be in danger during the traffic stop. He then continued on to write that he now feels like he fully understands what minorities go through when stopped by police. Huh?
Ol’ Clark has run-in with the law
After over three million miles of driving and using my turn signals religiously, Ol’ Clark was pulled over for not signaling a right turn, giving me a chance to better understand how minority motorists feel when they are pulled over for the most trivial reason, or no reason at all.
TRENDING ON FREEDOM DAILY
* Trumps Quickly Leaving Germany After Shock Announcement – Here’s Where Air Force One Is Taking Them
* BREAKING: Assassination Attempt On One Of The Trumps While In Germany – Look Who Cops Have In Custody
Here’s Ol’ Clark’s story.
The intersection of Grace Lane and Lake of the Woods Road carries a heavy traffic load to major subdivisions all the way south to highway 63. Cars on Grace Lane can go either left or right at Lake of the Woods, where traffic does not stop. It can be a very dangerous corner.
On one recent evening, I left my gym half a block south of the intersection and, upon reaching the stop sign, I stopped and remarked to myself that I couldn’t believe there was no traffic in either direction. There was only a car a block behind me.
My stop had been total, not rolling. I turned right and headed toward Interstate 70. Within 100 yards, red lights flashed behind me, seeming to come from nowhere. I pulled over to allow an emergency vehicle to pass, stopping in the intersection with Bull Run Drive. Then I realized the lights were for me.
I was now blocking traffic onto Bull Run, so I rolled slowly forward to a shoulder wide enough for both vehicles. The move made sense.
I’m lucky I didn’t get shot. Sirens wailed and when I stopped, two officers were out of the sheriff’s vehicle. When I reached over to turn off the radio and then take my wallet out of my pocket to produce the driver’s license and insurance card, I realized my hands were not at the top of my steering wheel. Danger lurked and official arrogance was to follow.
I had no idea why I had been stopped. I rolled down the window and when the sheriff’s deputy approached, my question was, “Why am I being stopped?”
“Because you didn’t use your turn signal back at Grace Lane.” And she added, “And you don’t move your vehicle when we stop you.”
“Hey, I was blocking a major intersection because I thought you were an emergency vehicle and traffic couldn’t move.” No answer.
After surrendering my license and insurance card, here came the lecture while the second officer stood guard. Then I asked the question: “I normally am very good about using my turn signal,” I said, realizing that the deputy had probably heard that excuse too many times before. “Tell me, just how did that infraction interfere with the flow of traffic since there was no one except you behind me? How did I endanger others? What did I do to compromise the safety of others and the flow of traffic?”
The answer, “You didn’t use your turn signal. If you don’t agree, plead “not guilty.”
Why bother? It would be me against two officers. If they said, “no turn signal,” the cost of the ticket would be increased. I said: “Give me the ticket. If you say I’m guilty, I’ll be guilty.” I felt a warning would have been sufficient.
Now I’m charged with a moving violation, though I was stopped, by the deputy’s admission. I have no idea what the fine will be because there is no listed fine for not using the turn signal. I had to call the fine collection center in Jefferson City. The service agent there couldn’t tell me the fine because they had not received a copy of the ticket a week later. You tell me how this operates.
Now a note for the deputy and her standby partner. I was not wearing a seat belt at the time and that is a more serious offense. And, when the two officers turned off their red lights and pulled back into traffic on Lake of the Woods Road, they did not turn on their left turn signal to let traffic know they were changing from the shoulder to the right traffic lane. Whatever fine I pay should be less than what these sheriff’s deputies should pay. I was at least stopped when I allegedly violated.
I can fully understand how easy it is for police to make random stops. I have a rear bumper full of liberal bumper stickers and a dent. My car is old, with 425,000 miles, which probably makes me an aging hippie with a weed habit. So why not pull me over?
I’ve just come to appreciate even more the words of those minorities when they speak of harassment and police arrogance. I had a good dose of arrogance on this evening and, in my rear view mirror, the image of the second officer out of the car, his hands ready in case I made the wrong move. My life seemed to be in danger.
I fully understand how a person can lose their respect for law officers. When you are in the shoes of the minority, you learn a lot more about their journey.
Bill Clark’s columns appear Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Reach him at 474-4510.
The day after Clark’s column was published, Boone County Sheriff Dwayne Carey saw the column and began questioning Ol’ Clark’s claims by writing a response to Clark’s lies. He wrote, in response to the column, that the Boone County Sheriff’s Department’s motto is “treat people like you would like your mother to be treated.” But in a move that completely rendered Clark’s narrative a complete lie, the Sheriff added a dashcam video of the incident.
In the video above you can clearly see Clark’s car roll through the stop sign and then turn right without signaling. The officer’s car then signals Clark to pull over as he goes through another intersection. The officer’s car siren sounds briefly before Clark’s car comes to a complete stop. The deputy then gets out of his squad car and the rest seems like your typical routine traffic violation stop without any controversy whatsoever.
Nice try Bill Clark!

"Baby Flamingo Tries Hard To Be Adult, Becomes Internet Star","There’s an adorable baby flamingo living at Pittsburgh’s National Aviary, and it’s taking its first steps towards becoming an adult.
As visitors and folks on the Internet watch the baby flamingo realize that being an adult is difficult, people find the bird just too relatable.
“National Aviary staff and visitors can’t stop ooh’ing and ahhh’ing over this little one!,” said the caption of an adorable photo of the 4-day-old bird posted on the organization’s Facebook page.
Honestly, people can’t stop praising the chick for its fluffiness and admiring its super long legs.
But what’s most adorable about the bird is that it tries to adult so hard. Twitter user Celesse also shared the pics of the birdie with the following caption: “BABY FLAMINGO… Who’s trying so hard to flamingo.”
We can see the bird trying to stand on one leg like an adult. We watch it doing its best to make sense of its anatomy and changing body…
Yup, adulting is not easy, little fellow! Well, at least the bird doesn’t have to deal with taxes and loans yet. Psst… Don’t grow up, baby flamingo! It’s a trap!

Gotta love the little guy. He may be timy now, but he will be rather large when grown.
The Flamingo is also a rather friendly bird. They are known for their love of kissing. If you have ever met one that was domesticated you understand.

Trump Just Sent A Horrible Surprise To The Dirty Democrats!,"Home Uncategorized  
 
President Trump is tired of having officials who refuse to behave in the best interest of our country. Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters are just a few of them. They are purposely harming our country by stealing our hard-earned tax dollars. But Trump is planning to put an end to this.
When Donald Trump became president, he knew that Washington DC had swamp creatures. And since then he has learned that the most of the members of Congress are in fact swamp creatures, which political pundits call it “UniParty.” This party includes Democrats and Republicans, which have one thing in common. They all vote for legislation that would hurt middle-class Americans.
Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters are one of those swamp creatures. Their biggest motivation is to bring down Trump. But they forgot one big thing, Trump isn’t a politician, he doesn’t play dirty games like the rest of them, he is here to destroy them.
One example of how the “UniParty” is hurting millions of Americans: “The failure of Congress to pass Obamacare reform means the tax reform agenda for the middle class is now far less likely. The ‘UniParty ’ members know this, and they are the ones that are doing the bidding of the lobbyists.”
According to reports, “The average American worker on the individual healthcare market are now stuck with increasing premium costs for their insurance plans, AND we get the double whammy because we must pay higher taxes to subsidize those who need Medicaid. Congress knows this. The UniParty politicians are not blind to the consequences of doing nothing.”
The Senate must go to a 51 vote majority instead of current 60 votes. Even parts of full Repeal need 60. 8 Dems control Senate. Crazy!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)
So, before it’s too late, Trump will work to stop these creatures from ruining our country. Trump is more than ready to bring his brutal surprise to these dirty Democrats, like he said: “Our country needs a good ‘shutdown’ in September to fix this mess.”
either elect more Republican Senators in 2018 or change the rules now to 51%. Our country needs a good ""shutdown"" in September to fix mess!

Shocking Video Shows Trump Manhandling French First Lady — Was it Cowardly Payback?,"July 13, 2017Samantha Layne News
Donald Trump Sinks To New Lows Daily
Donald Trump has a thing about handshakes. We all know this now. When meeting someone, the President attempts to show his dominance through his grip. It’s a brutish display of what a simple person thinks of strength – which means no one should be surprised that this is Trump’s preferred method of greeting other leaders.
But back in May, during the NATO gathering, French President Emmanuel Macron made the decision that Trump would not pull what had become his signature alpha-male move. Instead, Macron made it clear that Trump’s attempt to show strength wasn’t going to work with him and so, when they met, Macron gave it back to him, pump for pump, jerk for jerk.
The handshake went on uncomfortably long, the seemingly pleasant smiles on the two men’s faces belied by the tension in their jaws and the whitening of their knuckles.
In the end, a wounded, bewildered Trump jerked his hand back, and Macron emerged the victor in the contest the U.S. President himself started.
It isn’t that Macron believed his own masculinity, strength and leadership was somehow reflected in that handshake. It was that Trump believes that, and so Macron decided to speak the President’s language. A show of strength, even through something like a handshake, is the only thing POTUS understands.
And Trump has this thing with handshakes.
And on Thursday, he made it even more evident by taking it to a new low.
Trump Is Scared Of President Macron
Knowing that his brutal variation of the handshake wouldn’t work on President Macron, Trump decided to use it on Macron’s wife Brigitte.
The awkward handshakes continue. This time with the First Lady of France. pic.twitter.com/ac0kNbvyqM
— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) July 13, 2017
Yes. That is the President of the United States, manhandling the First Lady of France…and it may be because Macron hurt his feelings with that now-infamous NATO handshake.
White House aides admitted that the President was angered by the Macron handshake, and his admittance that the handshake had been deliberate.
“Macron was quoted in a French journal talking about his white-knuckled handshake with Trump at their first meeting … where the newly elected French president gripped Trump’s hand tightly and would not let go for six long seconds in a show of alpha-male fortitude. Hearing smack-talk from the Frenchman 31 years his junior irritated and bewildered Trump.”
In fact, it irritated Trump so much that many viewed that handshake as the “nudge” that led him to petulantly pull the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.
Trump’s Brutishness Is Not Strength
It was the sort of thing that really gets under his skin. That handshake with Macron, the handshake that left him “bewildered” and, probably, frightened – as bullies often feel when they are confronted – has probably been stewing still. This is a man who is so easily and deeply offended that he endangered the entire globe by withdrawing from a climate pact because his feelings got hurt.
And, as bullies and small men often do, the President lashed out. But he won’t lash out at Macron, who has shown himself able to handle his own. No, Trump went after Macron’s wife, First Lady Brigitte Macron. After all, the U.S. President has shown himself more than willing to hurt women.
Just as Macron openly admitted that “My handshake with him, it’s not innocent,” neither is Trump’s handshake with Macron’s wife innocent, either.
It was the President’s own wife who stated, several times, that when someone hits her husband, he strikes back ten times harder.
“As you may know by now, when you attack him he will punch back 10 times harder. No matter who you are, a man or a woman, he treats everyone equal,” the First Lady said.
RELATED: Kellyanne Conway Suffers a Hilarious Attack of the Memes after Ridiculous Flash Card Stunt
But sometimes, when he strikes back, he prefers to target the wife, instead.
And that’s not actual strength. That is, instead, a weak man’s idea of strength.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani vowed Wednesday to retaliate against additional sanctions imposed by the United States, accusing Trump administration officials of ""duplicity in their actions.""
“Surely, if the Americans seek to apply sanctions against us under whatever title or pretext, the great nation of Iran would aptly respond to them,” Rouhani said.
The Trump administration on Tuesday announced new sanctions targeting 18 people, groups and firms supporting the Iranian military, its revolutionary guard and its ballistic missile program. Iran's missile development is banned by the U.N. but not covered by the nuclear accord struck between Iran and six world powers two years ago.
Earlier this week, the State Department certified to Congress that Iran was technically in compliance with the nuclear deal — officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) — but was ""in default of the spirit"" of the accord.
The nuclear accord lifted economic sanctions against Iran in return for the Islamic Republic halting development of nuclear weaponry. The other countries that signed on — Russia, Britain, France, China and Germany — remain committed to the accord. Trump, however, has repeatedly railed against ""the very bad deal.""
Rouhani dismissed the Trump administration complaints as political.
“We are glad that our partners in the P-five-plus-one have steadfastly employed perseverance to safeguard the JCPOA,"" Rouhani said. ""As always, Americans resorted to duplicity in their actions.""
Major General Mohammad Ali Ja’afari, commander of Iran's revolutionary guard, stressed that Iran’s missile development is not negotiable.
“Iran’s missile power in air, sea and on land is rapidly increasing, and this is an inalienable principle,"" he said. He said the U.S. should move its regional bases more than 600 miles from Iran if it plans to blacklist his guard or impose sanctions on the military. The U.S., he said. ""has to pay a high price for its miscalculation.""
Iran's Foreign Ministry condemned the latest sanctions as a ""worthless move"" and said it would soon impose ""sanctions on a number of American natural and legal persons which have taken measures against the Iran and other Muslim regional nations.""
Trump sanctions Iran over missiles, terrorism after saying it complies with nuclear deal
U.S.: Iran defying spirit, but complying with nuclear deal
The ministry statement noted U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson ""once again confirmed Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal in a letter to the U.S. Congress in a move that ran counter to all their previous claims"" of Iranian misbehavior.
The statement said the ""unilateral and illegal sanctions"" were designed to compensate for the Trump administration's failure to persuade its European allies to withdraw from the nuclear deal.
The U.S. will freeze any assets the targets of the latest sanctions have in the U.S. and will prevent U.S. citizens from doing business with those targets.
""The United States will continue to aggressively counter Iran’s malign activities in the region,"" the State Department said. ""While the review is ongoing, the United States will also continue to expect strict Iranian adherence to Iran’s nuclear commitments.""

"ALERT: POPULAR Fitness Blogger KILLED Using COMMON Kitchen Product, THROW THEM OUT NOW","Sean Brown AMERICA’S FREEDOM FIGHTERS –
Rebecca Burger is a popular fitness blogger from France, and she was tragically killed this week by a popular kitchen product after it exploded in her face.
Many of us have been to Starbucks or other coffee houses and watched as the baristas served a warm coffee with whipped cream on the top of it. The baristas use a compressed air container filled with cream to dispense the product, which is exactly what Burger was doing in her home when she was killed.
Apparently, the dispenser was either faulty or it wasn’t made strong enough to withstand the high pressure forced into it by a nitrous oxide fuel cell, and it had a catastrophic failure, the Daily Mail reported. When the device exploded in her face, a piece of it hit Burger, who was only 33, in the thorax, causing her to go into cardiac arrest and die almost immediately after.
From the Daily Mail:
French media reported that it brought on a heart attack and that this is what caused her death.
Warning others of the dangers, the family said: ‘This is an example of the cream siphon which exploded and hit Rebecca’s thorax, causing her death.
‘The siphon which caused her death was sealed. Don’t use this product in your homes! Tens of thousands of the faulty devices are already in circulation.’
They did not name the brand of the dispenser.
While the brand of the dispenser hasn’t been identified, this should be a lesson to anyone wanting one of these products in their home; don’t buy the cheap stuff. These dispenser should be able to withstand high pressures, and if a company is skimping out on the materials to build them with, odds are they’ll be more susceptible to the type of failure that killed the beautiful young woman above.

"WATCH: Wife Comes Home Earlier Than Expected, Teaches Husband’s Mistress A Painful Lesson","July 3, 2017JodiWorld News
A Chinese mistress hangs from utility cables outside her lover’s home.
When a wife returned home earlier than her husband expected, she came upon a scene even crazier than something out of a movie. As she caught her husband and his lover in the act, what unfolded proved to be a painful lesson for the mistress and sweet validation for the wife.
Another bizarre cheating video has surfaced out of China, where last week a woman caught her husband in bed with his mistress, only to dish out a painful dose of karma to them both. This time, the mistress leaped from a window to avoid being caught by her lover’s wife and subsequently became tangled in some electrical wires.
Wearing only her underwear, the woman can be seen in photos hanging by her feet from the cables high above the ground as a crowd of astonished onlookers forms beneath her, recording the scene with their smartphones and watching to see if she will fall.
It is unclear whether the woman survived the ordeal or if she was injured, but from the looks of the way she was entangled in the wires and seemingly not moving, it seems unlikely that she would have walked away unscathed.
The unverified clip is thought to have been filmed somewhere in China and shows a crowd of people watching and filming the bizarre scene.
A long ladder is shown being rested against the wall nearest the woman in a bid to bring her down.
The clip was posted on (the) video sharing website LiveLeak along with a headline claiming: “Mistress hangs upside down on utility cables.”
The sub headline then states: “Wife came home earlier than expected.” [Source: The Sun]
In China, having an affair is not illegal, as the law only prohibits a married individual from wedding again before divorcing their spouse first. Thus, it is common for those who have been scorned to take matters into their own hands, doling out violent forms of vigilante justice to their significant others and their respective lovers.
That is precisely what happened what when a Chinese man caught his wife naked in bed with another man. Accompanied by his friends, one of whom filmed the entire ordeal, the man beat his wife and her lover black and blue. The footage of the shocking assault later went viral on Chinese social media.
Perhaps incidents like that one, where the cheating party is beaten bloody, are why the presumed mistress in the above video chose to leap from a window instead of facing her lover’s wife. In any case, it’s a safer bet to simply end the relationship if you’re thinking of bedding someone new.
However, it seems that these sort of “old-fashioned” morals are all but dead in today’s culture, where affairs are more common than monogamy, lies are told more often than truths, and a viral video is worth more than a marriage.

Trump Just Turned To The Camera In Warsaw And Said Three Words That Will SHAKE The World,"Joker 1 hour agoNews, Politics, USA, World76 Views
President Trump is in Poland today before a G20 Summit in Germany. The President had a very warm reception to Poland, with people screaming “Donald Trump” and “USA” as he approached the podium.
His speech was incredible, and provided a great outline about the challenges the Western world faces in the 21st century. While he was speaking, he asked this one crucial question:
“The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive.”
He then continued this opening with a series of follow up questions:
“Do we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost? Do we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders? Do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it?”
The whole speech is incredible, and you really need to watch it to get the full effect.Here’s a short clip, he asks the questions around 0:25:
Europe and some parts of America have become too critical of Western values and traditions. President Trump is urging those who still appreciate Western values to stand up to the globalists and cultural Marxists that seek to dissolve borders and fundamentally change the Western way of life.
Thank you for this speech, Mr. President. Hopefully, before G20, the leaders of Western countries will be able to answer those questions with an emphatic “YES.”

Syrians inspect the site of a suicide bomb attack in the capital's eastern Tahrir Square district on Sunday.
(CNN)A suicide bomber blew himself up in central Damascus on Sunday, killing at least 20 people, according to the Syrian foreign ministry.
Dozens more were injured, including children, the ministry said in a letter to the UN Security Council, according to state media.
Syria's Health Minister Nizar Yazigi said injuries ranged from minor to severe, state media reported.
Charred vehicles are seen at the site of a suicide bomb attack in the Syrian capital's eastern Tahrir Square district.
Authorities had been pursuing three cars and were able to intercept two and destroy them, state media said.
As they closed in on the third car near the city's Al-Tahrir Square, the suicide bomber on board detonated it.
Syrian men look at a cordoned off area at the site of a suicide bomb attack in the capital Damascus' eastern Tahrir Square district.
Since the civil war began in 2011, Damascus has rarely been hit by attacks. Government troops and allied militias have held a tight grip on the city.

In March, rebel groups launched a surprise attack in northeastern Damascus, taking advantage of Syrian regime forces overstretched by fighting elsewhere in the country, an expert said at the time.

Davis allowed one-out singles to Brandon Phillips and Freddie Freeman before Phillips scored from third on a wild pitch. Matt Kemp followed with a run-scoring single before pinch-runner Lane Adams stole second and moved to third on Tyler Flowers’ fly ball to the warning track in centre field.
Following an intentional walk to pinch-hitter Matt Adams, pinch-runner Dansby Swanson stole second, leaving runners on second and third. Davis walked Sean Rodriguez, playing in his first game of the season, to load the bases.
Johan Camargo’s fly ball to shallow left ended the game, giving Davis his 18th consecutive save this season.
Ben Zobrist gave Chicago a 2-1 lead with a two-run single in the fifth. Anthony Rizzo hit his 23rd homer to centre in the seventh, and Addison Russell drove in Javier Baez with a pinch-hit double in the eighth.
Lester (6-6) allowed one run in his first win since June 24. He added some offensive highlights to his big night. He hit a third-inning double and stole second — the first of his career — following a sixth-inning walk.
Lester returned to his winning form after allowing 10 runs, four earned, in two-thirds of an inning in a 14-3 loss to Pittsburgh on July 9.
The Cubs, coming off a sweep of Baltimore, have won four straight and trail first-place Milwaukee by 3 1/2 games in the NL Central. Chicago began the night only one-half game ahead of the Braves in the NL wild-card race.
Teheran (7-7) allowed two runs and five hits and four walks in six innings, leaving him 1-7 in 10 home starts. He is 6-0 on the road.
Phillips’ single up the middle drove in Ender Inciarte, who stole third, in the third.
Kyle Schwarber ended the sixth inning by catching Freddie Freeman’s fly ball in foul territory before tumbling over the short wall on the left field line.
The start of the game was delayed 1 hour, 3 minutes by weather.
Braves RHP Arodys Vizcaino (right index finger strain) had one strikeout and allowed no hits in one inning for Triple-A Gwinnett in what may be his only injury rehab appearance. Monday’s roster moves left the team with a seven-man bullpen, but manager Brian Snitker indicated he’d go back to having eight relievers when Vizcaino returns in “a couple days.”… OF Danny Santana (bacterial infection) came off the 10 day DL. RHP Jason Hursh and IF Jace Peterson were optioned to Gwinnett.
Rodriguez made his Braves debut, starting at third base. He mishandled a grounder hit by Willson Contreras in the fourth for an error.
Rodriguez spent the first half of the season recovering from surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff in his left shoulder after a vehicle he was driving was rammed by a stolen police car in Miami on Jan. 28.
“I’m like a little kid on his birthday,” Rodriguez said before the game.
Cubs: RHP John Lackey (5-9, 5.20) is expected to come off the disabled list to make Tuesday night’s start. He went on the DL with right foot plantar fasciitis following his previous start on July 5.
Braves: Rookie LHP Sean Newcomb (1-4, 426) will make his seventh start, and his first against Chicago. Newcomb has allowed a combined 11 runs in 7 1/3 innings in losing his past two starts.

Rep. Steve Scalise discharged from Washington hospital,"July 26 (UPI) -- The MedStar Washington Hospital Center said it has discharged Rep. Steve Scalise, who is in ""good spirits"" following the shooting during a congressional baseball practice that threatened his life.
The hospital said it discharged Scalise on Tuesday after the congressman made ""excellent progress in his recovery from a life-threatening gunshot wound six weeks ago.""
""Awesome news. Can't wait to have you back to work,"" U.S. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said in a statement.
The Louisiana Republican will now begin a period of intensive inpatient rehabilitation.
""He is in good spirits and is looking forward to his return to work once he completes rehabilitation,"" the hospital said in a statement on Wednesday. ""He and his family are grateful for the care he received from the trauma team as well as the other doctors, nurses, and staff of MedStar Washington Hospital Center. The family also appreciates the outpouring of prayers and support during this time.""
Scalise underwent surgery to manage a deep-tissue infection related to his bullet wounds on July 13, after receiving previous surgeries also related to the shooting.
Police say gunman James Hodgkinson, 66, who had expressed grievances with Republicans, opened fire on the Republican squad practicing for the annual congressional baseball game and injured Scalise. Five others were also injured in the incident and Hodgkinson was killed in a shootout with police.

Melania Saved BIG Personal Surprise For End Of Trip – Look What She’s Been Hiding The Whole Time,"The fast and effective trip to Paris, France this week has just come to an end after only 48-hours. Never ceasing to impress and represent America well, the pair were the picture of grace and class. They got along well with France’s new young president Emmanuel Macron and his wife, as the foursome seemed to have become friends. However, before Melania boarded Air Force One back to the United States, she revealed what she has been hiding, saving her big personal surprise for last.
The quick intercontinental trip was an important one for America’s leader to forge a strong bond with France’s new leader. The two seemed to do just that in two days and Melania toured Paris with France’s First Lady, Brigitte Macron. The chilly interaction between the two seen between the two in Belgium on Melania’s first overseas trip, seemed to slip away, as Brigitte warmed up to our quiet, yet exceptionally kind first lady. Perhaps it was preconceived notions she had toward Melania or typical female comparisons, but the women hit it off this second time around.
Among several stops made in and around Paris, Melania and Brigitte visited a children’s hospital together, which has become routine for our first lady. While they were there, Melania spoke with precious patients and their families, as well as the hospital staff. She didn’t seem to struggle for conversation and genuinely enjoyed her time, but there was something she revealed while there that proves she’s even more incredible than we all realized when she debuted an impressive skill she has.
“Some of the children’s parents were in the room as Melania and the children gathered around a table topped with building blocks, books and toys,” Mail Online explained. Melania greeted everyone in the room saying “Hello! Bonjour! How are you?” in French, which she’s fluent in, along with Serbian, German, Italian, and English. Melania reportedly switched effortlessly from back and forth between French and English when holding conversations with patients, parents, and reporters.
The media and even her presidential predecessors are quick to discredit this incredible woman by reducing her to Trump’s arm candy and having nothing to offer or important to say. She not only has a lot of important things to say, especially as a successful immigrant in America and an awesome example of compassion, but she can say all of this in several languages. This skill alone proves what an intelligent woman she is on top of all of her other impressive qualities. Adding to her multi-lingual ability is that she’s passed this off onto her young son, who is also fluent in more languages than one.
“Beaming in her red skirt suit, she greeted the children with soft ‘bonjours’ before taking her seat at a play table,” Mail Online reported. “The 47-year-old then introduced herself enthusiastically. ‘Je m’appelle Melania. Et toi?’ she gestured to one child, urging them to share their name. When one of the children replied in English, she commended them: ‘You speak very good English, very good.’”
Daily Mail explains why she became fluent in a total of six different languages:
TRENDING ON FREEDOM DAILY
“French is one of six languages the first lady is believed to speak. Slovenian is her native tongue and was the first she learned.”
“She is also widely reported to speak Italian, German and Serbo-Croatian. Her grasp of Italian and French came from the four years she spent living and working as a model in Milan and Paris between 1992 and 1996, when she moved to New York.”
“German and English are the foreign languages most commonly taught in Slovenian schools, followed by French. It’s not clear whether Melania had a taste of any before she quit her university degree in design to leave her home country in the early 1990s.”
Despite this impressive trait, Melania’s detractors have found a way to turn it into a negative to attack her. Although her biggest critic, comedian Chelsea Handler, struggles to sound just half way intelligent when she speaks English, she joked on Melania last year when she said that the first lady can “barely speaks English.” So-called “Deplorables” were quick to Melania’s defense after this public lashing by providing Handler with a list of languages that the first lady has mastered, English being one of them.
While Michelle Obama often sounded unintelligent with her “street” talk, especially as she slammed America on her overseas travel, Melania can communicate with world leaders in their native tongue while being classy in the conversation.

"Brilliant: The Best ""Help Wanted"" Sign of ALL TIME!","It’s rare that one tweet tells you everything you need to know about an organization. But one of the latest from the so-called Women’s March does exactly that in horrifying fashion.
Originally billed as a simple stand for women’s equality (because who could be against that?), the Women’s March now defines its mission as “dismantling systems of oppression through nonviolent resistance and building inclusive structures guided by self-determination, dignity and respect.” The usual hysterical and ill-defined lefty boilerplate.
However, yesterday their Twitter account signaled that the Women’s march is rather…negotiable…on that “nonviolent resistance” part:
Happy birthday to the revolutionary #AssataShakur! Today’s #SignOfResistance, in Assata’s honor, is by @Meloniousfunk. pic.twitter.com/V66au1dRnl
— Women’s March (@womensmarch) July 16, 2017
Who is Assata Shakur? A 1970s Black Panther member.
And a cop killer.
From the David Horowitz Freedom Center’s profile of Shakur:
Also in the early 1970s Shakur joined a BPP offshoot known as the Black Liberation Army (BLA), a violent group that was tied to the murders of more than ten police officers nationwide between 1970-73. As Jordan Schachtel writes in Conservative Review, BLA was “a splinter group comprised of the most radical members of the Black Panthers,” and Shakur herself “was the leader of a notorious New York City BLA cell that hunted down police officers for brutal assassinations.” According to former Assistant FBI Director John Miller, Shakur was “the soul of the Black Liberation Army.”
Because of her involvement with BPP and BLA, Shakur became a target of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO) and thus went into hiding in the early ’70s. While underground, she was placed on the FBI’s Most Wanted List because of her involvement in three bank robberies, the kidnapping and murder of two drug dealers, and the attempted murder of two policemen.
At about 12:45 a.m. on the morning of May 2, 1973, the fugitive Shakur was being driven to a new hideout in Philadelphia by BPP Information Minister Zayd Malik Shakur (Assata’s brother-in-law) and BLA member Sundiata Acoli, when their car was pulled over by state trooper Jaibes Harper for a tail-light violation on the New Jersey Turnpike. Fellow trooper Werner Foerster provided backup for Harper. While the lawmen conducted routine questioning of the vehicle’s occupants, Shakur (who was in the front passenger’s seat) and her companions suddenly fired upon them with semi-automatic pistols. As Foerster grappled with the driver, Shakur shot the trooper twice before her gun apparently jammed. With Foerster on the ground wounded and helpless, Shakur grabbed the trooper’s own firearm and blasted two fatal shots into his head, execution-style.
Shakur was eventually captured, convicted, and sentenced to life in prison…but escaped in November 1979. She currently enjoys political asylum in Cuba, from which President Donald Trump has demanded she be extradited back to the United States.
And yet, this murderer deems her a “revolutionary” worthy of “honor.” Are her violent tactics the kind of “resistance” the Women’s March has in mind? Do they want more police officers dead? Open warfare in the streets?
Naturally, sane people on Twitter had some strong reactions to seeing the Women’s March true monstrous evil laid bare:
Do you realize about 95% of America is gonna have a real problem with any attempt to celebrate a cop killer who’s a fugitive from justice?

So far, it appears the Women’s March has not responded to the uproar, which is just as well, because what could they say? What spin could possibly make this tweet even remotely defensible?
They had fifteen minutes of fame at the beginning of the year pretending to be a responsible cause that actually had some possible connection to women’s interests. But when they failed to take the country by storm, apparently they decided appealing to normal people wasn’t worth the effort, and have just fully dived into satisfying every leftist delusion and prejudice they can find, no matter how foul.

Conservative Koch network criticizes U.S. Senate healthcare bill,"FILE PHOTO: An Americans for Prosperity banner is seen during an event in Manchester, New Hampshire, July 22, 2015.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. Officials with the conservative U.S. political network overseen by the Koch brothers say they are unhappy with the healthcare bill that may be voted on by the Senate this week and will lobby for changes to it.
At a weekend event with conservative donors, top aides to Charles Koch, the billionaire energy magnate, said the Senate bill does not go far enough to dismantle former President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, also known as Obamacare.
“We have been disappointed that movement has not been more dramatic toward a full repeal,” said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, a grassroots advocacy group backed by Charles Koch and his brother, David.
The Senate's 142-page proposal, worked out in secret by a group led by Senate Majority Leader McConnell, aims to deliver on a central campaign promise of President Donald Trump to repeal Obamacare, which has provided coverage to 20 million Americans since its passage in 2010.
Republicans view the law, formally called the Affordable Care Act, as a costly government intrusion and say individual insurance markets created by it are collapsing.
Phillips and other aides to the Koch network told Reuters they want to see the Senate bill do more to roll back Obamacare's expansion of the Medicaid program for poor and disabled Americans. They also contend the bill does not do enough to reform the U.S. healthcare system and cut costs.
The aides said lobbying efforts to reshape the bill are continuing ahead of a planned vote.
Similar concerns helped steer the House’s version of the bill in a more conservative direction. A primary mover of that effort, Mark Meadows, a Republican congressman from North Carolina, attended the Koch donor event.
Meadows, chairman of the conservative Freedom Caucus in the House, said he is prepared to support the Senate bill if it clears that chamber, a sign that quick action to land the legislation on Trump’s desk is possible.
However, Meadows said the Senate version of the bill would need to be amended to allow insurers who sell plans on Obamacare’s insurance exchanges to offer less-expensive plans that do not comply with that law’s coverage requirements.
Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who currently opposes the Senate bill, has offered an amendment along those lines. Cruz attended the Koch event here, as did Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who remain undecided.
Meadows also seeks an amendment that would allow some consumers who have private health savings accounts to deduct the cost of insurance premiums from their taxes.
Senate leaders have set a goal of passing the healthcare measure by the end of this week, ahead of the July 4 congressional recess, which would then send it back to the House.
If the Senate passes legislation this week that is palatable to the House, Meadows said it is conceivable the House could pass that version and choose to forgo a formal conference committee that would reconcile the Senate and House bills. That, he said, could result in sending the bill to Trump’s desk for his signature before the recess.
Getting a vote by the end of the week could be difficult.
Five Senate Republicans, including Cruz, have publicly voiced their opposition to the current Senate draft. No Senate Democrats are expected to back it, which means McConnell cannot afford to lose more than two Senate Republicans.
As a sign of the Koch network’s influence, Phillips said his organization is prepared to spend as much as $400 million before next year’s congressional elections to advocate for the network’s conservative causes.

‘Bodies Everywhere’: Police Swarm Texas Walmart To Find Smuggling Attempt Gone Wrong,"Posted by Georgette Walrath | Jul 24, 2017 | National Security
When authorities were called to a San Antonio Walmart on Saturday Night, they found scores of illegals trapped in a truck, eight of whom had perished from the horrific conditions.
In another example of why President Trump’s border wall is imperative, eight people were found dead in a truck parked at a Texas Walmart on Saturday. A tractor trailer truck was discovered with 39 illegals trapped inside, without water or air conditioning, while temperatures soared in San Antonio.
Authorities say the truck was linked to trafficking, which entails bringing human cargo into the U.S. illegally. Sixty–year-old James Mathew Bradley Jr of Clearwater, Florida, was driving the truck. He was taken into custody to face charges on a host of violations.
First responders told reporters that the conditions inside the trailer were horrific. According to immigration officers, eight illegals were dead when police arrived on the scene and another died at the hospital on Sunday. One person was found in the nearby woods, trying to escape on foot, but authorities aren’t sure how many others fled before emergency medical teams reached the site.
Eight people were dead at the scene and another one died in the hospital on Sunday.
The police were notified of suspicious activity by a store clerk. The employee contacted officials after one of the “passengers” approached, asking for water. Video surveillance footage from Walmart closed circuit recordings show a number of vehicles picking up survivors before authorities were alerted about the truck.
In addition to the nine dead, investigators discovered 20 other people in critical condition, two were school age children. Eight other illegals were in moderate condition, but they were also taken to area hospitals for treatment.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is working closely with the Mexican government to discover the nationalities of the people involved. Because San Antonio is only a few hours’ drive from the border, officials are trying to establish the legal status of the occupants. It’s fairly obvious that the victims were hoping to criminally enter America.
Police chief William McManus and fire chief Charles Hood explained to reporters that the unbearable conditions had lead to the deaths.
San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenburg stated that caring for those involved was authorities’ first priority in the “human tragedy.”
Praising the town’s first responders, Nirenburg explained that they were immediately on the scene, “delivering first aid, transporting – sometimes by air – critical condition patients to local hospitals, and trying to prevent more loss of life than what had already occurred.”
Local fire chief Charles Hood told reporters that the passengers exhibited severe dehydration symptoms including high heart rates, and hot, dry skin. “We’re very fortunate that there weren’t 38 of these people who were all locked inside this vehicle dead,” he added.
Hood called the incident a “mass casualty situation” for emergency response teams.

U.S. attorney for the Western District of Texas Richard Durbin explained the magnitude of the crime. Although these people were breaking the law to enter the country, they were victims of “ruthless human smugglers indifferent to the wellbeing of their fragile cargo,” he said.
Illegal immigrants not only receive taxpayer benefits, but many of these “teens” are criminals by nature. Since they aren’t even supposed to be in the United States, they feel that they can act on their illicit urges without fear of conviction.
The National Weather Service recorded 101 degree temperatures in San Antonio in Saturday, making the interior of the trailer dangerously hot. The outdoor heat didn’t reduce to 90 degrees until 10 p.m. maintaining the broiling trailer-oven.
Thomas Homan, acting director for ICE issued a statement that explained the problem with human trafficking. “By any standard, the horrific crime uncovered last night ranks as a stark reminder of why human smuggling networks must be pursued, caught and punished,” he said.
Emergency crews worked for hours with members of ICE to help the victims and try to determine their nationality.
He added that ICE “works year-round to identify, dismantle, and disrupt the transnational criminal networks that smuggle people into and throughout the United States. These networks have repeatedly shown a reckless disregard for those they smuggle, as last night’s case demonstrates.”
Police chief William McManus said that officials consider the incident a “human trafficking crime.” He added that the conditions were “horrific.”
Investigators gathered evidence from the truck on Sunday, but the origin of the vehicle is still unknown. It had Iowa license plates but no other identifiable markings. Of the illegals receiving treatment, no other information is available on whether or not the ones in critical condition will pull through.
Authorities said that most of the people trying to enter the U.S. were teenagers. Now, more than ever, American needs a functional barrier that will stop this type of tragedy from occurring. The border wall will help put human smugglers out of business and keep everyone safer.",Conservative Daily Post,1
Senior Republican lawmaker wants more sanctions on Russia,"Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Ed Royce (R-CA) arrives for a hearing with U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on ''Advancing U.S. Interests at the United Nations'' in Washington, U.S., June 28, 2017.
WASHINGTON A senior U.S. Republican lawmaker filed legislation on Friday that would sanction Russia for its violations of a decades-old arms control agreement, calling them a threat to global stability.
Washington and Moscow have long questioned each other's commitment to the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which banned nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with a range of 500-5,500 km (300-3,400 miles).
Representative Ed Royce, chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement that Russia President Vladimir Putin has disregarded Russia's obligations under the INF Treaty for years.
""His recent deployment of banned nuclear-tipped missiles poses serious threats to U.S. national security interests,"" Royce said. ""And it's just one more example of Russian aggression that undermines global stability.""
The U.S. military said in February that Russia had secretly deployed the ground-launched SSC-8 cruise missile in violation of the treaty. Russia has denied violating the treaty.
Royce filed his measure as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a must-pass annual bill that sets policy for the Pentagon.
The deadline for filing NDAA amendments was Friday. Royce's filing also coincided with President Donald Trump's first face-to-face meeting with Putin since he became the U.S. president in January.
Trump promised a rapprochement with Moscow as he campaigned for president but many U.S. lawmakers, including many of his fellow Republicans, have sought to take a tough line against Russia.

"Feinstein: North Korea a ""clear and present danger"" to U.S.","Feinstein calls North Korea a ""clear and present danger"" to the United States
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said Sunday that North Korea poses a ""clear and present danger"" to the United States, in the wake of the country's second test of an intercontinental ballistic missile.
Feinstein said on ""Face the Nation"" that after spending time on intelligence and in briefings, she's ""convinced that North Korea has never moved at the speed that this leader has to develop an ICBM to put solid fuel, to have an interesting launch device, and to have a trajectory which, as of the latest analysis, would enable it to go about 6,000 miles and maybe even hit as far east as Chicago.""
""We can't have that,"" she added. ""To me, it points out the danger in isolating a country, that they go to the science and the technical know-how to show their brute force, not to handle the isolation.""
Sen. Dianne Feinstein on ""Face the Nation,"" July 30, 2017
Feinstein's comments come after President Trump tweeted Saturday about North Korea, saying he is ""disappointed"" in China for not doing enough in regard to the country -- a sentiment Feinstein echoed.
""I'm very disappointed in China's response, that it has not been firmer or more helpful,"" she said.
China has said that it shouldn't be held responsible for solving the nuclear standoff with North Korea, and that it doesn't hold the key to resolving the issue.
The intercontinental ballistic missile North Korea tested Friday flew longer and higher than the first one the country tested, according to its wary neighbors, leading analysts to conclude that a wide swath of the U.S. including Los Angeles and Chicago is now within range of Pyongyang's weapons.
Japanese government spokesman Yoshihide Suga has said that the missile flew for about 45 minutes -- about five minutes longer than the ICBM that was test-fired on July 4.
Following the launch, the U.S. conducted a missile defense test Sunday, using a Terminal High Altitutde Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system in Alaska. The U.S. Air Force launched a medium-range ballistic missile over the Pacific Ocean, and the THAAD system -- in Kodiak, Alaska -- ""detected, tracked and intercepted the target,"" the U.S. Missile Defense Agency said in a statement Sunday.
Feinstein said ""the only solution is a diplomatic one.""
Feinstein added that she hopes incoming White House Chief of Staff Gen. John Kelly will be effective in beginning some ""very serious negotiation with the North and stop this program.""

Makeup Artist Disqualified As Winner Of National Contest Sponsored By This Liberal Company Over Pro-Trump Post,"BEAUTY AND FASHION FASHION STYLE POLITICS

So like that wasn’t enough the liberals started targeting Trump’s supporters!
A talented makeup artist from Kansas won a national contest, entitling her to a swanky trip to Los Angeles and a generous gift card. After the decision was rendered, it was revealed that the victor was — gasp — supportive of President Trump, an irrelevancy that nevertheless led directly to the rescission of her crown.
Makeup artist Gypsy Freeman, of Wichita, took screenshots which show she won the national Saint + Sinner Contest sponsored by Kat Von D Beauty in June, according to the Wichita Eagle.
“It’s definitely bigotry – it’s everything that they’re calling us, they’re doing,” Freeman told the newspaper. “It’s a huge case of hypocrisy.”

Instagram users later reportedly discovered Freeman’s pro-Trump post from Election Day in November.
Freeman claims that Von D later messaged her, saying she’d “drawn a personal line in the sand between myself and anyone who supports that man.”

Gov. Rick Scott will ask the Florida Cabinet next month to prohibit the state’s investment managers from doing something they already do not do: invest in companies or securities owned or controlled by the Venezuelan government.
The proposed resolution released by the governor’s office on Thursday stops short of advancing a bolder threat Scott had been making at public appearances as recently as last week when he vowed to boycott companies that “do business” with the Nicolás Maduro regime.
Instead, the vote on the resolution — scheduled for the Aug. 16 meeting of the State Board of Administration — will be a mostly symbolic gesture aimed at sending the message that Florida will not tolerate any business sympathetic to the Maduro regime going forward. The SBA oversees the Florida Retirement System and its $150 billion in assets.
“We currently do not maintain any investments owned by the Venezuelan government right now,” SBA spokesperson John Kuczwanski told the Herald/Times. The governor’s resolution will not change that but make sure it doesn’t change going forward.
Under the governor’s proposal, the SBA will be:
▪ Prohibited from investing in any securities issued by the government of Venezuela or any company that is majority owned by the government.
▪ Prohibited from taking a shareholder proxy vote that advocates or supports the Maduro regime.
▪ Prohibited from doing business with any financial institution or U.S. company which directly, or through a subsidiary, violates federal law by making a loan, extending credit, or makes purchases with the government of Venezuela.
“The atrocities happening at the hands of the brutal and oppressive Maduro regime are unspeakable,” Scott said in a press release detailing his proposal. “I have heard firsthand from Floridians about the need for change in Venezuela. Prohibiting the Florida State Board of Administration from making investments that support Nicolás Maduro is a big step in the right direction, and we must continue to find ways to bring freedom and democracy to Venezuela.”
Scott, who is expected to run for U.S. Senate next year, has been courting South Florida voters with tough talk on the Maduro government.
“Next month, at my next Cabinet meeting, I will be proposing a resolution that will say any organization that does business with the Maduro regime cannot do business with the State of Florida,” Scott proclaimed at a July 10 rally at the El Arepazo restaurant in Doral. The crowd cheered.
If he had followed through on his threatened boycott of companies that do business with the Maduro region, it would have affected companies like Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which purchased $2.8 billion in bonds in May from Venezuela’s state-run oil company, and companies like Delta Air Lines and McDonald’s, which still operate in the country.
Although the governor, attorney general and state chief financial officer act as the State Board of Administration, they need a state law to sell off large amounts of assets that could affect the profitability of the Florida Retirement System funds. Additionally, a 16-year-old U.S. Supreme Court ruling may bar them from telling state agencies to boycott companies that do business in Venezuela.
Goldman Sachs manages $478 million in funds in Florida’s Long Duration Portfolio, which totals $8.2 billion. The SBA said the company also manages $21 million in a 2004 fund, Distressed Managers II, and the SBA owns $147 million in Goldman Sachs securities that can be sold on the open market.
Florida Gov. Rick Scott talks during the Venezuela freedom rally in Doral.
Goldman Sachs said in a statement last week that it purchased the Venezuelan bonds for its investment clients through a broker in the secondary market and the bonds were initially issued in 2014 by Petroleos de Venezuela.
Because the SBA has a fiduciary responsibility to keep the state pension fund healthy, it may not sell off large amounts of assets if that could affect the profitability of the fund — unless it is ordered to by law, Kuczwanski said, although investment managers have already flagged Venezuela as risky.
“We ensure we have a prudent investment strategy, and we would always look at any governments that are in turmoil,” he said.
State Sen. José Javier Rodriguez, a Miami Democrat who has announced he is running for the congressional seat being vacated by Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen next year, has drafted legislation that would require Florida to divest investments that could affect Goldman Sachs and any “institution or company doing business with the government of Venezuela.”
Scott said in his news release Thursday that he “will work with the Florida Legislature during the next legislative session to take more action against Maduro and his gang of thugs.”
Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has promised “swift and strong economic actions” against Venezuela, including its oil sector, if it goes through with the July 30 vote to form a constituent assembly sought by Maduro.
Kuczwanski said that the SBA sees the ban on Venezuela investments similar to the 2007 Protecting Florida’s Investments Act that requires the SBA to refrain from buying securities and investments from foreign companies with business operations in Sudan and Iran involving the petroleum or energy sector, oil or mineral extraction, power production or military support activities.
“We see this operating very similarly to that prohibition,” he said.

Post-Brexit trade deals 'threaten UK's animal welfare standards',"House of Lords report warns farmers will be pressured by imports from countries that use cheaper methods to produce food
High animal welfare standards used in producing meats such as beef could be threatened by post-Brexit trade deals.
 
House of Lords report warns farmers will be pressured by imports from countries that use cheaper methods to produce food
Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent
Tuesday 25 July 2017 02.37 EDTFirst published on Tuesday 25 July 2017 01.30 EDT
“Overwhelming” support in the UK for high animal welfare standards is under threat from Brexit, an influential parliamentary committee has said.
The report from the House of Lords warns the standards of UK producers could be put under pressure by demands from other countries to allow an influx of cheap and lower-standard food as part of trade deals.
It was published as the prime minister’s spokesperson said that allowing imports of US products such as chicken meat washed with chlorine would not be ruled out in trade deals. This came from No 10, despite assurances to the Guardian last week from the Department of Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) that any trade deal would maintain or raise food standards.
Preserving food standards would be “of the highest priority” Defra told the Guardian, and trade deals in agriculture would not be “a race to the bottom”.
Livestock welfare and crop-growing standards in the UK are among the world’s highest, but that could be subject to sudden change if farmers are challenged by imports from countries that produce meat and other food with much lower standards. Without firm and explicit support for agricultural standards in any post-Brexit trade agreements, the UK’s high standards would be at risk.
The government’s wish for the UK to become a global leader in free trade is not necessarily compatible with its desire to maintain high animal welfare standards
The House of Lords subcommittee on EU Energy and Environment found that if imports from other countries were allowed without the current EU safeguards, then the standards of UK producers would come under pressure.
“The government’s wish for the UK to become a global leader in free trade is not necessarily compatible with its desire to maintain high animal welfare standards,” the committee found.
Liam Fox, one of the ministers leading the government’s Brexit strategy, is in the US for talks on a new trade agreement that is almost certain to include agricultural products, including meat and genetically modified vegetables.
At present, the UK is protected from controversial US-produced agricultural goods, by EU standards that deter imports of products such as meat that has been washed in chlorine, which has a high bacterial content related to low animal welfare standards. EU rules also barmeat that has been fed with hormones and growth-promoting antibiotics.
Such products are allowed for sale in the US and attempts by the UK to impose higher standards on any imports would be a difficult part of trade deal negotiations.
Lord Teverson, chairman of the sub-committee that wrote the House of Lords report, said Brexit would threaten the UK’s high standards of food for human consumption.
“We heard overwhelming support for farm animal welfare standards to be maintained or improved. We urge the government to secure the inclusion of high farm animal welfare standards in any free trade agreements it negotiates after Brexit.”
But he warned: “The government will need to consider the effect of increasing standards on the competitiveness of UK producers as well as the future trading relationship with the EU.”
The committee said that while consumers are currently protected by the high welfare standards required by the EU, which are much more stringent than those in countries such as the US and China, most people buying food are unaware of this.
Food labelling standards may also confuse consumers, the committee said, as they do not make it clear where and to what standards meat and vegetables have been produced.
Keith Taylor, an MEP and spokesman for the Green party, said: “Fox is promising to discard the vital precautionary principle that guides EU policy-making and protects citizens from any process, procedure or product that carries with it a plausible risk of harm.”
He pointed to the example of pesticides, dozens of which are permitted in the US but banned in the EU on health and environmental grounds.
In the US,antibiotics are routinely used to improve animals’ growth, sparking fears that meat consumption could increase human resistance to antibiotics. They are also used to limit diseases that could otherwise spread in the megafarms, holding tens of thousands of animals, that are commonplace in US farming.",The Guardian – Politics,0
America will have to kill liberty unless she kills sectarianism,"Adam Garrie6 hours agoJuly 12, 2017 99
The United States is becoming more violent because supreme liberty is incompatible with un-regulated sectarianism from within and without.
The west’s support of Salafist terrorist groups in Syria, Libya and beyond is well known. Few leaders the west even try to hide this fact, they simply give the terrorists somewhat anodyne English names whether it be something as specific as ‘Free Syrian Army’ or something more obtuse like ‘moderate rebels’, ‘democracy fighters’ etc.
We know from a variety of sources, including from the Syrian President that terrorists can, have and will continue to sneak into western states under the guise of being refugees.
But the third point in this proverbial Bermuda Triangle is little discussed. This is the west’s domestic social policies which fan the flames of terrorism on the home-front.
The American model of religious pluralism has been widely adopted throughout the wider west, a model which is distinct from the model used in early Islamic caliphates, modern Ba’athist republics, the Russian Federation or The Islamic Republic of Iran.
The United States Constitution introduced the idea of freedom of religion as a matter of individual liberty rather than one of a singular approved state religion or a list of state religions.
Indeed, early migration to the US, primarily from Britain and later from other parts of western and later central Europe, were often people drawn to a land of not only alleged economic opportunity but also the opportunity to view religion as a personal choice rather than a form of confessional patriotism.
In almost all these instances, those who sought the ‘American lifestyle’ were those from Christian sects that were not the official or otherwise majoritarian confession of their native land.
The other models mentioned differ in a single important way, in spite of their practical differences from each other. In the early Islamic Caliphates, in modern Ba’athist societies, in the Russian Federation and in the Islamic Republic of Iran, religious pluralism was and is based on religious groups that are not derived from recent or even relatively recent waves of migration.
Russia, Iran and Syria, to use three contemporary examples are literally religiously plural societies in respect of the historic make-up of their present borders. As such, all three took the pragmatic decision to allow for each confession to have the right to worship freely as preferable to forced conversions or in the event of that failing, civil holy war.
America by contrast quickly adopted idealism as the justification for its religious pluralism and as such, it encouraged further migrations for mainly heterodox Christian sects.
In today’s America, this same attitude has been expanded to not only include non-Christian religious people seeking the religious liberty guaranteed by the Constitution, but also and more dangerously among violently Godless people seeking to use the US Constitution as a protector of heterodox lifestyles which many in the wider world and also in the US believe to be perverse and dangerous.
But what happens when America imports various perverts, radical Salafists and every other conceivable sectarian group form every culture in the world, all at the same time?
The tragic answer is that America is creating by design, something that in other countries exists at a much more manageable level due to historical default.
In Iran, the Shi’a Muslim majority lives in peace with the Christian minority, including many Armenian Christians. In Russia, Muslims (whether Sunni or Sufi) live in peace with the Orthodox Christian majority.
In Syria, Sunnis, Shi’as, Orthodox and Catholics live happily in areas that have not experienced a wave of migratory terrorists and mercenaries who were sent to Syria to molest the placidity of a pluralistic and secular Ba’athist society.
These ancient religions who all believe in the primacy of the same God have found a way to coexist and cooperate in peace in the aforementioned places and in some places beyond.
Even in mid-20th century India, the secular Congress Party was able to forge a society that was home to Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists and Jews. The fact that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has taken several big steps back in respect of the treatment of the large Muslim minority is unfortunate, but it is still a matter of dealing with India’s diverse history rather than a problem of a foreign element.
How does the united states expect radical Salafists to live next to radically politicised sexual perverts who in turn must live with a combination of Christian fundamentalists, moderate Christians, moderate atheists and others?
It simply cannot work and the increased political violence in the United States is a sign that it isn’t working.
America must choose from the following options:
1. Does it want to be sectarian and authoritarian for the sake of peace and security?
2. Does it want to end sectarianism assuming it still can, for the sake of maintaining traditions of manageable liberty?
Many in America who call themselves libertarians have discovered that liberty has its limits in a sectarian society. In a society comprised of similar sects, however imported they might be, liberty can just about function without causing violence.
But when a plethora of various groups preaching entirely different lifestyles which are underpinned by an entirely different ethos all live side by side, it is not difficult to imagine why things turn rapidly violent. Suddenly the letter of the law prohibiting violence becomes confronted with the inevitable violence which is unleashed by tense living situations.
Countries like Russia, Iran and Syria tolerated the main sects of Christianity and Islam but if they encouraged the fomenting of new made-up sects (primarily radical secular ones) as the US does, if they imported those with totally different beliefs and if they adopted the anything goes attitude of classical libertarianism, they too would be doomed. Syria, Iran and Russia are religiously pluralistic because clear boundaries are set against fringe sects from proliferating mainstream society, thus allowing society to accommodate historically established mainstream sects and groups.
If America is going to be a nation of Christian fundamentalists–so be it, but it means no importation of Salafists and no tolerance for perverse domestic groups. If America is going to be a sanctuary for perverts–so be it, but it means the end of America’s long Christian traditions and of course it would also mean no more Salafists.
The best option would be for America to compromise and end the importation of Salafist and like-minded immigrants, end the political support for contrived perverse domestic groups advocating for awkward lifestyles and also not allowing existing radical Christian, Jewish or Muslim groups to take centre stag in any way shape or form.
It is only within a framework of law and order that religious pluralism can function peacefully. America has lost the plot which is why many innocent Americans are losing their minds.
Liberty has its limits and extreme authoritarian has its dangers. The question as to whether America can still find a balance is very much up in the air.",The Duran,1
American Eagle Trying to Convince American Youths to Wear “Cool” Hijabs!,"Looks like American Eagle Outfitters is advertising new hijabs as the ‘cool’ thing for American youth to wear. Do they really think that promoting something that is worn by oppressed Muslim women is ‘cool’? How about something worn by women who have had their genitalia mutilated, is that cool?
Hey, I’m all about capitalization, but for American Eagle to promote hijabs as a ‘cool’ thing to wear or popularize on them, knowing what these women go through…I don’t find that too cool!
One of the United States most popular fashion stores, American Eagle Outfitters, has now begun selling a “denim hijab,” in order to capitalize on the “popularity” of Islam in America. This decision is outraging many customers and is a blatant display of cultural appropriation for financial gain.
When American Eagle Outfitters announced its new denim hijab, many on Twitter were noticeably upset. Not only is the company one of the most patriotic brands, but the hijab — which is normally worn by Muslim women — basically promotes oppression and everything that American women fought against.
Twitter users were very quick to call the company out.

When it relates to money prostitution exists in all phases of life, tragic but true.

Even Muslim women were speaking out.
Denim hijab from American Eagle? What? Also, I would never wear denim on my head.
The clothing company decided to promote its hijab by hiring 2016 Miss Minnesota contestant, Halima Aden, to sport the denim head cover. Saying on Twitter, “She caught our attention at 2016 Miss Minnesota USA, where she competed in a burkini and hijab.”
The hijab is a religious symbol in some Islamic cultures, where women are not free to uncover their heads in the presence of males who are not close family members.
Simply put, it screams oppression.
What’s worse than American Eagle promoting that type of female denigration is the fact that the company is doing it because “peaceful muslims” are trendy and it’s a great way to capitalize on the buzz.
Of course, American Eagle isn’t the only company now promoting the hijab of oppressed Muslim women. Nike recently released a sports hijab for female Muslim athletes, also bowing to the oppressive religion.
Nike becomes first major brand to launch hijab for women
American Eagle’s denim hijab is cultural appropriation for financial gain, and they didn’t even go to great lengths to make the thing look good. It looks like extra denim fabric just thrown over someone’s head. Very unoriginal.
Speaking of originality, the slogan on the company’s website that sells the hijab says, “Wear it your way, make it as original as you are.”
There’s a whole religion of women who have to wear these cloths as a sign of subservience — millions upon millions of them the world over — it doesn’t seem so original to us.
Some people have praised both American Eagle and Halima since the #WeAllCan fall 2017 ads.
Let us know what you think about American Eagle Outfitters selling the hijabs as a ‘cool’ new thing for our American youths to wear, especially as his/her new ‘back-to-school’ clothing.
Does American Eagle Outfitters really want our American youths to promote a culture that oppresses women and believes in genitalia mutilation?",Ihavethetruth,1
Parents of Charlie Gard Release Heartbreaking Statement On Life-ending Decision,"As was reported earlier Monday, Charlie Gard’s parents have decided to end the legal battle to keep him alive and attempt treatment outside the United Kingdom.
Chris Gard, with Charlie’s mother Connie Yates standing next to him, made a tearful statement to the press on how and why they’ve come to the decision at this time.

— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) July 24, 2017
We now know that the hospital withholding treatment as the protracted legal battle over whether Charlie’s death sentence would hold created a scenario in which the boys condition was allowed to deteriorate to the point that the long shot medical treatment was even less likely to be effective.
The doctors were still willing to go ahead with treatment, even after new scans and tests revealed that the treatment could not undo the damage already done by the hospital and the court’s unwillingness to let Charlie Gard’s parents take him elsewhere when they were no longer willing to provide treatment.
Whether Charlie Gard would’ve survived through experimental treatment in the United States, we’ll never know. But that’s not the point. This serves as the best reminder of what can happen when the government is in charge of health care. When courts decide whether or not you have the right over yourself and your children to try to live and the government has been given the power to stop you and say, “No, you’ll stay here and die because we say so.”
This is a tragic day for Charlie and his parents. It’s also a sorry indicator of where we are on the road of individual liberty and the rights we have to our own lives today.",RedState,1
WELCOME TO AMERICA! Five Million New Citizen Immigrants Can’t Speak English,"There was a time when speaking English was a requirement to attain citizenship in America. Assimilation was the goal of immigrants. It’s that mindset that made America great! The benefits of diversity with the goal of everyone, from other cultures, working together as one. Not anymore.
The Washington Examiner has the details:
In a stunning indictment of the system that tests immigrants on their eligibility to become “naturalized citizens,” a new report finds that a third are functionally illiterate, unable to speak and understand enough English to get that status.
Some 32 percent of naturalized citizens, about 5 million, fall below “basic” skills in English, the equivalent of being functionally illiterate, according to a new report from the Center for Immigration Studies.
The report is a follow on to one that found 67 percent of immigrants in the United States for 15 years or more can’t speak much English.
… The author, Jason Richwine, an independent public policy analyst, concluded:
How did millions of immigrants become citizens without basic English literacy? The simple answer is that the government’s English test is far less demanding than the PIAAC test. The PIAAC definition of literacy is “understanding, evaluating, using, and engaging with written text to participate in society, to achieve one’s goals, and to develop one’s knowledge and potential.” Simply reading and writing basic English sentences does not necessarily meet that definition. As mentioned above, even some native English speakers struggle to apply their knowledge to language-intensive tasks.
Maybe this is something that needs to change under the Trump Administration.

Eight people, including two children, have been found dead after they were locked inside a boiling truck without air conditioning or water in what police believe could be a human trafficking incident.
A total of 38 were found in the truck, which didn’t have a working air conditioning system despite blistering temperatures topping 100 degrees in San Antonio.
Two of those found inside were children. All have been rushed to nearby hospitals, with 20 in an ‘extremely critical or very serious condition’.
The driver of the truck has been arrested, however police have not released his identity. –Daily Mail

There are strong deterrents that don’t even have to include jail time.
Impound the vehicle used (and the load) for a period of time…
Revoke a driver’s license…
That sort of thing.

Stolen Valor Finally Catches Up To Master Manipulator As Judge Destroys Him,"Posted by April Horning | Jul 19, 2017 | Liberal Corruption
Bocci appears before the judge to answer his charges.
The stories Michele Bocci shared about his amazing life are captivating. He has traveled the world as a Marine and lost his canine partner in an accident. He also took a job at a local children’s hospital helping sexual abuse survivors in their recovery. When not in practice as a pediatric plastic surgeon, he learned German well enough to work for the government as a translator. It seems he has lived a life most people could only dream about, except it was something Bocci did dream up.
Authorities in Portland, OR discovered Bocci was a con-artist. He had created a variety of stories to gain sympathy and donations from the public in the area. His stories changed to accommodate any need he had.
For example, at some point, Bocci lost a pet. He had a dog that needed to be cremated, and suddenly this family pet became so much more. Bocci spun a story about his bravery while serving as a Marine. This dog turned into a decorated and well-trained member of the Marines as well. This was no longer just a dog Bocci couldn’t afford to bury but instead a dog that deserved a special honor.
Bocci created this tale where he had lost the dog in the line of duty; he had been killed. According to a news report about the case:
“Bocci, who claimed to be a decorated U.S. Marine, said his bomb-sniffing dog had been hit and killed by a car. The story was shared by concerned people on social media.
After hearing his heartbreaking story, a local funeral home offered to help. Springer and Sons funeral home in Aloha provided free cremation for the dog, along with a specially designed urn, which included a military emblem and custom engraving. An invoice shows the value as $310.”
After a local news crew had started to research this tragic story, this story fell apart. Michele (Bocci spells his name “Michele” but pronounces it Micheal) was never in any arm of the United States military. Beyond the donation of the dog cremation, Bocci had used the sad tale of serving as a Marine to garner other supports as well. There is evidence that he used social media to gain the trust of community members who gathered donations of clothing, food, and cash. At one point, the story was that Bocci was a single father after the sudden death of his wife. Depending who he was talking to, he either had one or two children.
These are the names Bocci used that the authorities have already confirmed.
Bocci’s stories became even more complicated as he changed from being an ex-Marine to a German translator. In some versions of the story, he worked with retail giant Nike while others said he might have worked for the government. He used this story to make friends with professionals in the area and gain further sympathy as he shared his wife had died from cancer four weeks prior.
If the two lives of Bocci’s were not enough, he also somehow became a doctor at Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU). Under the name Dr. AJ McClure, Bocci created a new life where he was doing inspirational work with reconstructive plastic surgery for sex abuse victims.
Even though there was not a Dr. AJ McClure on staff at OHSU, this did not stop Bocci from approaching businesses in the community to use his status as a doctor for his selfish gain. At one point, he had contacted a local car dealership to see if they would allow him to borrow a high-end car for the weekend.
It seems that there were times when Bocci had no reason to lie but did so anyway. A local family explained a chance meeting with Dr. McClure on the waterfront. He was on a jet ski that had stopped working. The family offered to help him, and he told them his whole story about working at OHSU. He seemed to be so caught up in the lies he truly began to think they were the truth even going as far as telling complete strangers.
At some point, many of the stories circulating about this great Marine who lost his dog, the very great German translator and of course Dr. McClure came crashing down. He had used too many stories to con well-meaning neighbors.
Bocci now faces criminal charges tied to his scheme. He was recently in court to face charges of criminal impersonation and theft. At one point the court was able to find at least six different names used by Bocci. They also discovered he was quite creative in finding supports for his stories. He had gathered donations via social media, connections to women on dating apps and via networking with professionals in the Portland metro area.",Conservative Daily Post,1

Awan and his family have reportedly worked for House Democrats for years. He declared bankruptcy in 2012, but has made millions of dollars on the House payroll over at least a decade of work for various members, according to a Politico report.
In March, a group of House Democrats fired Awan and one other staffer over their alleged involvement in the scheme and the looming criminal investigation. However, Fox News reported Tuesday that Wasserman Schultz still has Awan on her staff's payroll despite him being barred from accessing the House's computer system since February.
At the time, Reps. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) and Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) both defended Awan.
“As of right now, I don’t see a smoking gun,” Meeks told Politico in March. “I have seen no evidence that they were doing anything that was nefarious.”
“He needs to have a hearing. Due process is very simple. You don’t fire someone until you talk to them,” Fudge added
A spokesman for Wasserman Schultz's office told Politico in March that Awan worked for the staff in an ""advisory"" role “providing advice on technology issues.”",The Hill,0

KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii/WILLOW, Alaska Disused military tunnels snake beneath the crater of Diamond Head, out of sight of the tourists lounging near the volcano on Waikiki Beach but very much on the mind of Gene Ward, a state representative from Honolulu.
Alarmed by North Korea's latest missile tests and claims that its newly developed intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) can carry a large nuclear warhead, Ward believes it is time to refurbish the tunnels as civilian shelters in case of a North Korean attack.
""We've had wake-up calls before but what happened on July 3 is shaking us out of bed,"" said Ward, referring to Pyongyang's latest missile test.
North Korea's state media said the missile reached an altitude of 2,802 km (1,741 miles), and some Western experts said that meant it might have a range of more than 8,000 km (4,970 miles), which would put Hawaii and Alaska within striking distance.
Americans from the Alaskan tundra to the tropics of Hawaii have had years to contemplate North Korea's accelerating missile program, which has generated both angst and shrugs given that the reclusive government's true capabilities and intentions remain unknown.
Ward, a Republican in a Democratic-majority state, said he supports reviving state legislation that would reopen the bunkers built by the U.S. military even before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 that prompted U.S. entry into World War Two.
The tunnels are among many military bunkers and batteries carved into Oahu as part of a buildup that began after Hawaii became a U.S. territory in 1898 and continued through World War Two.
If Hawaiians have a stronger sense of vulnerability stemming from Pearl Harbor, then some Alaskan seem largely unperturbed.
Doyle Holmes, a retired U.S. Navy pilot and hardware store owner who lives about 50 miles (80 km) north of Anchorage, sums up his advice to fellow Alaskans this way: ""Go back to sleep and don't keep worrying about it.""
Holmes, 79, a Republican Party activist who retired in March from the Alaska State Defense Force, said his attitude is rooted in his abiding faith in the U.S. military's ability to counter any attempt by North Korea to strike American soil.
""It would be self-annihilation if they launch a missile at the United States,"" Holmes said.
""I think we are going to be OK. I went through the nuclear fallout classes and the bomb shelter stuff in the 1950s and 1960s,"" he said, referring to U.S. preparations for a potential Cold War-era Soviet attack that never came.
Last week the U.S. Senate's Armed Services Committee proposed $8.5 billion of funding for the Missile Defense Agency to strengthen homeland, regional and space missile defenses.
Some of this would pay for 28 missile interceptors to augment 32 already at a base in Fort Greely, Alaska, a Hill staffer said. The department already had plans to place 40 interceptors at the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) battery by the end of 2017.
Some experts on Northeast Asian political and security issues believe political leaders and the media have been too quick to qualify North Korea as a nuclear power, questioning whether it can genuinely delivery a functional nuclear warhead with accuracy or whether North Korea would risk certain U.S. retaliation.
But Denny Roy, a senior fellow with the East-West Center think tank in Honolulu, said the public discourse had definitely changed with the latest episode.
""The milestone is that Americans seem to believe that North Korea can hit the U.S. homeland, whereas up until now it was all theoretical and potential,"" Roy said.
Hawaiians are mindful that the islands could make an enticing target given their large concentration of U.S. military power, including the Pacific Command responsible for U.S. forces in Asia.
""I'm not building a bunker yet, but we definitely have to stay vigilant,"" said Reece Bonham, 24, a retail manager in the city of Kailua-Kona on the Big Island of Hawaii.
Caelen McHale, 21, a University of Hawaii business management major, was skeptical of North Korea's claims and confident in U.S. military power, but still worried how the United States might respond.
""Our administration is scarier than North Korea's,"" she said.

Island Beach State Park was closed Saturday and the State Park Police mobilized to seal off its 10-mile beach to the public. At Barnegat Lighthouse State Park across the inlet, there was no police presence and the park was full of visitors.

Christie is defending his use of the beach, closed to the public during New Jersey's government shutdown, saying he had previously announced his vacation plans and the media had simply ""caught a politician keeping his word.""(Photo: Andrew Mills, NJ Advance Media via AP)
TRENTON, N.J. — To critics who say he shouldn't be lounging on a beach off-limits to taxpayers during the New Jersey government shutdown, Gov. Chris Christie says, ""Well, I’m sorry ... they’re not the governor.''
Christie made the comment early Monday during a telephone interview on WTXF-TV in Philadelphia. He said he was calling from the state governor's summer residence at Island Beach State Park, where he was photographed by The (Newark) Star-Ledger sitting with his family on a beach chair in sandals and a T-shirt on Sunday.
""This is a residence,"" said Christie. ""We have a residence in Princeton as well. And that place is a place where people can go and tour, but they can’t if the government is closed. Am I supposed to move out and stay in a hotel?""

Christie defended his use of the state property during the shutdown that affected the public, which is being kept out of state parks with signs blaming Democratic Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto, on Saturday, saying: ""That's the way it goes. Run for governor, and you can have the residence.""
On Sunday, Christie was asked whether he had gotten any sun that day, to which he said he didn't. After the pictures were posted, the governor's spokesman agreed that Christie didn't get any sun; he said Christie was wearing a baseball hat.

Still, Christie said people shouldn't have been surprised by the pictures. Spokesman Brian Murray had said Christie was headed to the beach house Saturday night.
""This is an incredible scandal as you know. They actually caught a politician being where he said he was going to be with the people he said he was going to be with,"" Christie said.

In an interview on WNYW-TV in New York, Christie said, ""I really wonder about journalists who spend money flying planes to look for people where they actually said they'd be.""
Few lawmakers were around the statehouse Sunday, and Christie said that unless he sent state police to retrieve them he could not force them to be there.
Christie, for at least the second time, referred to himself as ""Mr. Reasonable"" and said he would consider the Democratic budget along with legislation to overhaul the state's biggest health insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield. Or without the Horizon legislation he has called for, he would line item veto about $350 million of the Democratic priorities.

Over the weekend and Monday, the public began feeling the effects of the shutdown.

Among those affected were Cub Scouts forced to leave a state park campsite and people trying to obtain or renew documents from the state motor vehicle commission.
Many took to Twitter to voice their opinions on Christie's beach use.
Chris Christie closing the beach to the public and only opening it up for himself is the most real life Cartman/South Park thing ever.

— Daniel Dale (@ddale8) July 3, 2017
Not everyone blames Christie for the beach closures though.
Joe Nasso of Fair Lawn has a summer house at the Shore and had a different take on who was to blame.
Nasso made the point that Democrats control both houses of the state Legislature and therefore the state’s purse strings.
“Friends and family were planning on going into the park, so obviously, it’s affected them,” Nasso said.

Remaining open under the shutdown are New Jersey Transit, state prisons, the state police, state hospitals and treatment centers as well as casinos, race tracks and the lottery.
Liberty State Park was closed, forcing the suspension of ticket sales and ferry service from the site to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. But the latter two sites remained open.

China Clarifies Reports of VPN Ban,"China counters media reports that it plans to ban personal VPNs.
On July 10, Bloomberg revealed that China’s government has required the three big Chinese telecommunications firms — China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Telecom — to ban individuals’ access to virtual private networks, or VPNs, by February 1. A VPN is a third-party service that routes web traffic through servers in another country or location. As netizens in China have been suffering from the torture of the Great Firewall (GFW) for years and VPNs are the only resort for people to get access to the international internet, Bloomberg’s report was immediately widely spread across China — despite the fact that Bloomberg itself is also blocked by GFW.
Although the news is not a thunder from a clear sky — as   has reported, China declared its decision to crackdown on VPNs earlier in January 2017 — Bloomberg’s report and the detailed timeline still give Chinese netizens a new blow.
On July 12, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology finally replied to the report, claiming that “ the foreign media reported falsely” and the ministry hasn’t “issued such a notice.”
Enjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.
Ironically, the Ministry’s further explanation did actually partly confirm Bloomberg’s report. The Ministry told thepaper.cn, a Chinese news website:
The new regulation issued in January this year won’t affect the domestic and foreign enterprises and the majority of users who legally get access to the internet… The object of the new regulation is those unauthorized enterprises and individuals who haven’t got the licence to use VPNs… As for those foreign trade enterprises and multinational companies who need to get access to cross-border network, they can rent VPNs from those authorized carriers according to the law…
However, the Ministry neither elaborated on the law nor clarified who could be authorized to use a VPN. As usual, the issue becomes a new gray area, where nearly anyone could have broken the law without knowing it.
As   has repeatedly reported, China has launched a series of regulations to tighten internet control recently. Regarding the issue of VPNs, the ban, whether limited to unauthorized VPNs or not, will not only affect millions of netizens’ daily lives, but also numerous enterprises operating in China. As China keeps boasting its ambition to defend global trade and internationalization, its increasingly tight controls on the internet can’t be conducive to the big picture.",The Diplomat,0

WARSAW — Step by step, the Polish government has moved against democratic norms: It increased government control over the news media, cracked down on public gatherings and restricted the activities of nongovernmental organizations.
Now the party in power is moving aggressively to take control of the last major independent government institution, the courts, drawing crowds into the streets and possible condemnation by the European Union.
The party is pushing to jam several bills into law; one would force all the nation’s top judges to resign, except those it appointed. Another bill, already approved by Parliament, would ultimately give the government control over who can even be considered for a judgeship.
In Brussels on Wednesday, a top European Union official said that if the changes were made, Poland might slip outside the bloc’s definition of a democracy.
Continue reading the main story
“Each individual law, if adopted, would seriously erode the independence of the Polish judiciary,” said Frans Timmermans, first vice president of the European Commission. “Collectively, they would abolish any remaining judicial independence and put the judiciary under full political control of the government.”
Continue reading the main story
Continue reading the main story
The drive to control the courts comes barely two weeks after President Trump paid a triumphant visit to Warsaw and praised the populist and nationalist Law and Justice Party, which controls the government. Now, if the party prevails, its success could be the final chapter in Poland’s long progression from a model Eastern European nation — and one of the first former Communist nations to join the union — to what its opponents are calling an illiberal democracy.
Three former Polish presidents, including Lech Walesa, have released a manifesto against the proposed changes, saying “we do not consent to taking away our basic civic freedoms.” And a coalition of more than 175 artists and scientists signed an open letter on Wednesday calling the government’s move a “coup d’état.”
With the legacy of the Solidarity movement, Poland entered the post-Soviet era with a head start on other post-Soviet nations politically, and its strong agricultural sector allowed it to quickly emerge as an economic success.
But its status as a regional star has been endangered by the rise of the Law and Justice Party. Since assuming power in late 2015, the party has moved to co-opt or weaken potential rivals, beginning with the Constitutional Tribunal, which could have declared its moves unconstitutional. Now dominated by government supporters, the tribunal provides a reliable rubber stamp for government initiatives.
Law and Justice supporters have been put in charge of public television and radio, which now adhere to a firmly pro-government line. Independent oversight was removed from the secret services. The justice minister was named chief prosecutor, formerly a separate and more independent post. New regulations were imposed on public assemblies.
Still, at least one previous step to pull Poland to the right, a nearly total ban on abortions proposed last fall, was defeated after mass protests.
“This is a call for a right-wing revolution,” said Jerzy Stepien, the director of the Institute of Civic Space and Public Policy at Lazarski University, and a former president of the Constitutional Tribunal. “If we have people in power who feel themselves above the law, we are in a revolutionary situation.”

In the lower house of Parliament this week, as opposition leaders struggled to beat back the governing party’s push to pass its legislation, people on both sides delivered emotional speeches frequently interrupted by chants.
“You could have been reformers of the Polish judiciary,” an enraged Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, from the opposition Peasants Party, said to stone-faced lawmakers from the Law and Justice Party. “But you have become its executioners wearing a mask of justice.”

Things turned especially ugly during a debate at midnight on Tuesday in Parliament when an opposition politician, Borys Budka, presumed to speak for the former Polish president from Law and Justice, who was killed in a 2010 plane crash. “If Lech Kaczynski were alive, he wouldn’t allow this,” Mr. Budka declared.
An enraged Jaroslaw Kaczynski — the former president’s twin brother and, as leader of Law and Justice, the most powerful political figure in Poland — seized the lectern and fired back: “Do not wipe your traitorous mugs with the name of my late brother. You are scoundrels.”
Law and Justice has long maintained that the 2010 crash was an assassination, perhaps involving Russia and members of the political opposition.

“You murdered him,” Mr. Kaczynski shouted.
Ewa Kopacz, the prime minister under the previous center-right government, declared herself flabbergasted. “This man is crazy with hate,” she said of Mr. Kaczynski. “He cannot control his emotions.”
The conflict over the judiciary has been simmering for some time. One proposed law, already approved by Parliament and awaiting President Andrzej Duda’s signature, would reconfigure the National Council of the Judiciary, which chooses those eligible to become judges, so that government-appointed members would essentially have veto power.
A second bill, introduced late last week, would force all current members of the Supreme Court to resign, including several who have been feuding with the government, and replace them with judges selected by the governing party’s minister of justice.
“Their goal is to create political control over the judiciary,” said Adam Bodnar, Poland’s official ombudsman, who has come out against the bills. “I don’t have doubts about it.”
Continue reading the main story
Mr. Kaczynski and other Law and Justice officials contend that opponents are overreacting to an honest attempt by the government to reform a dysfunctional and highly unpopular court system and to root out corrupt judges and liberal ideologues who want to thwart the will of the people.
Law and Justice, Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said, has “stood on the side of the people, and nobody will make us turn back from this way — not even by shouting here and stamping your feet!”
To become law, a bill must have three readings in the Sejm, the lower house of Parliament, then be passed by the Senate and signed by the president. The government’s decision to use procedural maneuvers to fast-track the Supreme Court bill appears to have caught opponents off guard.
“There were no public consultations, no public hearings,” said Kamila Gasiuk-Pihowicz of the opposition party Modern. “There should have been experts’ opinions, but there’s no time for that.”
President Duda tried to suggest a compromise in a nationwide address. He said he would sign the bill on his desk involving the appointment of judges only if an amendment were added so that new judges must get 60 percent of the vote in Parliament rather than a simple majority. Since Law and Justice has only a slim majority in the Sejm, this would force the governing party to find at least one other party to vote with it. If that amendment is not added, Mr. Duda said, he will refuse to sign the Supreme Court law.
It was a rare disagreement between Mr. Duda, a former Law and Justice member who became independent when he was elected president, and Mr. Kaczynski. Opponents were not sure whether this signaled a true split between the two leaders or was some sort of a trick.
“We don’t know if the president is acting really with some sort of noble intentions or whether he’s just playing a game,” said Mr. Stepien, the former president of the Constitutional Tribunal.
As opponents sought to slow the bill’s passage, opposition leaders asked Poles to continue to take to the streets. Some protesters have set up a tent camp outside Parliament, vowing to keep a round-the-clock vigil. “I had to be here,” said Lidia Leipert, a lawyer who joined the throng after work.
Agnieszka Wierzbicka, a nutritionist, said she was already resigned to losing this round.
“I think our protest is nothing but symbolic now,” she said. “Will it change anything? I highly doubt it. But that doesn’t make it invalid. It is important for history.”

New Poll Reveals How Americans Feel About Living In The Era Of Donald Trump,"July 3, 2017News, Politics
?>&url;=?>ℑ=?>?w=640"" target=""_blank"" class=""socicon-twitter twurl"">
One of the only things that life in the Trump era makes you appreciate is the things you took for granted in the pre-Trump era.
A PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist Poll out early Monday found that 70 percent of Americans think civility has gotten worse since Trump’s election. Just merely 6 percent of Americans think civility is better now and 20 percent think it has stayed the same.
Subscribe to our Youtube Channel
The poll also revealed that Americans trust the intelligence community–yes, the same intelligence community that Donald Trump refuses to attend briefings for because he’s “too smart”– more than Congress and a whopping 61 percent of respondents say they do not put much trust in the Trump administration. That percentage is largely split among partisan lines, with 90 percent of Democrats saying they don’t trust the Trump administration and 84 percent of Republicans saying the opposite.
This speaks volumes about the hardships America is feeling while living under the Trump administration. The fact that we live in a era where our commander-in-chief is attacking the media on Twitter, and spewing misogynistic remarks left and right, and lying to the America people about how destructive the new healthcare legislation will be. This is not a time period anyone should want to live in.

Tough-talking Trump defense lawyer says he's no 'snowflake',"FILE PHOTO: Lawyer John Dowd exits Manhattan Federal Court in New York May 11, 2011.
NEW YORK The latest lawyer hired to represent U.S. President Donald Trump in the federal investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election is an ex-Marine who likens some cases to war.
""I fight hard,"" John Dowd said in an interview. ""I believe that's what I'm supposed to do. I am not a snowflake, I can tell you that.""
""Snowflake"" is a disparaging term for people considered overly sensitive and fragile that has been adopted by some Trump supporters to mock liberals.
Dowd, who spoke with Reuters on Wednesday, is a mirror of his client in many ways. He has a no-holds-barred, hyperbolic style and a history of attacking prosecutors, congressional Democrats and the media.
The 76-year-old Washington lawyer, who retired from the firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld in 2014, brings criminal defense and government investigation experience to Trump's legal team.
The team, led by New York lawyer Marc Kasowitz, is tasked with responding to Robert Mueller, the special counsel named by the Justice Department to probe whether anyone associated with Trump or his campaign had any illegal dealings with Russian officials or others with ties to the Kremlin.
Russian officials have denied meddling in the U.S. election, and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign.
In what Dowd said would be his last major trial, he defended billionaire hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam in one of the biggest insider trading cases of all time.
Rajaratnam was convicted of all 14 insider trading counts and sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2011.
Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Reed Brodsky, who prosecuted the case, said Dowd put on a strong defense in the face of overwhelming evidence. ""This is war, and I will defeat you,"" Brodsky recalled Dowd declaring in one phone conversation.
Dowd confirmed the sentiment on Wednesday. ""It is a war,"" he said of such cases.
His tactics in the Rajaratnam case reflected that belief. Dowd aggressively challenged the prosecution's stance on what constituted insider trading. He also fought the government's wiretaps of his client's cell phone, claiming investigators ""gamed the system.""
Brodsky said he believed the physically commanding 6-foot-4-inch-tall Dowd would be a ""ferocious defender of the president.""
In a manner similar to Trump, Dowd lashed out at what he perceived to be improper leaks by prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation during the Rajaratnam case, singling out then-Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in particular.
""He sat in the back of the courtroom with his press dogs,"" Dowd said. ""It was the most atrocious thing I've ever seen.""
Dowd also went after reporters. Bharara, who declined to comment on Wednesday, last weekend retweeted an intemperate 2011 email the defense lawyer sent to a Wall Street Journal reporter he accused of ""whoring"" for the prosecution.
In another encounter with the press caught on camera, Dowd swore at and gave the middle finger to a CNBC reporter.
Like Trump, Dowd has a tendency to put his own spin on adverse news. After the Rajaratnam verdict, Dowd argued ""the defense is winning"" because the prosecution chose not to pursue 23 other allegations of insider trading. ""The score is 23-14,"" he told reporters.
In a 2007 congressional probe of politically motivated firings of U.S. Attorneys, Dowd complained of McCarthyism when his client, former Justice Department official Monica Goodling, was criticized by Democrats for invoking the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination.
Dowd represented U.S. Senator John McCain on congressional ethics charges in the 1980s ""Keating Five"" banking scandal and conducted the Major League Baseball investigation that led to former Hall of Famer Pete Rose being banned from the sport for betting on games while he was manager of the Cincinnati Reds.
Dowd would not discuss legal strategy for Trump but said the team the president had assembled was great. ""We're all fighters,"" he said.
Though his hiring was first reported Friday, a person familiar with the matter said Dowd has been working with the team for weeks. Dowd said he knew Kasowitz partner Michael Bowe, who is also representing Trump, and met with Kasowitz at the end of May. Jay Sekulow, another member of the team, has been appearing on television on Trump's behalf.
Dowd also said he talked with the president but declined to describe their conversation. He called Trump ""a fighter for the people"" and said the president had done nothing wrong.
A onetime military lawyer with the U.S. Marine Corps, Dowd noted his shared service in declining to criticize Mueller, a Marine platoon leader during the Vietnam War.
""Bobby is doing what he has to do and he'll do a good job,"" said Dowd. ""He's a fellow Marine and he's a good man.""

New details on ex-banking exec found dead at hunting estate,"CBS/APJuly 20, 2017, 11:02 AM
Spanish banker Miguel Blesa's death at hunting estate ruled a suicide
Miguel Blesa, former chairman of savings bank Caja Madrid, leaves the High Court in Madrid, Spain, March 3, 2014.
MADRID -- Judicial authorities in Spain say that autopsy results show the Spanish banker involved in graft scandals who was found dead this week with a gunshot wound to his chest deliberately shot himself.
The body of Miguel Blesa, the 69-year-old former chairman of the now-defunct Caja Madrid, was found Wednesday in the garage of a private hunting estate in southern Spain after he told other guests he was going to move his car.
The forensic report confirms the widespread speculation that the case had been a suicide.
Blesa had been waiting for the result of an appeal to a six-year prison sentence for misusing corporate credit cards issued by Bankia SA, which absorbed Caja Madrid, one of the country's top saving banks, in 2011. Bankia was later nationalized and bailed out for 18 billion euros ($24 billion).
The credit card scandal ran from 1999 to 2012. An estimated 15.5 milion euros ($17.85 million), supposedly meant to cover the cost of bank board members and advisers attending board meetings, had been spent on jewelery, vacations and luxury clothes or just taken out of cash machines, the BBC reports.
Blesa chaired Caja Madrid between 1996 and 2010.
Both Blesa and former International Monetary Fund chief Rodrigo Rato, who chaired Bankia between 2010 and 2012, appealed a March ruling by Spain's National Court that condemned them to 6 and 4 1/2 years in prison respectively.
Blesa received the highest punishment among 65 defendants found guilty of hiding irregular and undeclared expenses with the cards. The two former bankers were released on bail while the appeal is resolved.
The former banker was also in the midst of a lawsuit involving irregular bonuses during his time at Caja Madrid. In 2013, he was briefly jailed for irregularities in the purchase of shares in the City National Bank of Florida, but a court later acquitted him.
Blesa also appeared in leaked documents of the Mossack Fonseca law firm, which was investigated for managing offshore accounts globally. According to media reports at the time, he used the Panamanian firm in 1989 to create a company in the British Virgin Islands in order to invest in Spain-based companies.

Among American bridges, San Francisco’s Golden Gate is the most prolific departure point for suicides.
At least 1,600 people have died since 1937 making the 220-feet leap into the bay.
Now, officials hope to all but halt the mounting deaths. Work began in April on a project to install horizontal steel nets along either side of the bridge, a system that has been shown to decrease suicides at other bridges.

Priya Clemens, a spokeswoman for Golden Gate Bridge, said many suicidal individuals go to bridges imagining, incorrectly, that hitting the water would be quick and painless.
“It is not quick and it is not painless,” she said. “People break their bones and then they suffocate because they can’t swim. But that’s the romantic image.”

The steel nets, positioned 20 feet below the walkway, are intended not so much to catch people, but to shatter that image with the threat of injury.

In Southern California, officials are studying similar measures at two more bridges: Coronado Bridge, stretching two miles across the San Diego Bay, and Colorado Street Bridge, in Pasadena.

Proposals to physically block people bent on killing themselves often elicit the same question: Won’t they just do it elsewhere?
It turns out, research has shown, that people dissuaded from a suicide attempt often go on to live full lives.
Critics have challenged both the cost — roughly $210 million in the case of the Golden Gate Bridge — and the aesthetics of such barriers. The money, some argue, might be better spent on mental health services.
For supporters, years of debate have been pervaded by a gnawing urgency over the lives being lost.
So far in 2017, at least 15 people have fatally jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge. Officials don’t expect the nets there to be in place for another four years.
At Coronado Bridge, a perch for roughly 400 suicides since 1969, a person made a fatal leap just a few days ago, said Rhonda Haiston, a Coronado activist who has lobbied for barriers.
In June, Caltrans began a 10-month study on the feasibility of suicide-prevention systems at the bridge. When completed, its recommendations would need to be debated and approved by various agencies.

“We know a lot of people are going to kill themselves in that time,” Ms. Haiston said.

O.J. Simpson is scheduled to appear before a parole board in Nevada on Thursday.Credit Ethan Miller/Associated Press
It’s parole hearing day for O.J. Simpson.
The former football star is expected to learn on Thursday whether he’ll be freed after serving more than eight years behind bars for his part in a bizarre armed robbery in 2007.
Here’s what you need to know:
Why is he in prison?
Mr. Simpson and several accomplices, two of whom carried guns, stole a trove of sports memorabilia from two collectibles dealers at a Las Vegas hotel-casino.
He claimed he was only trying to retrieve items that were rightfully his. Still, he was convicted of 12 felonies, and a judge sentenced him to a minimum of nine years in prison.
What will happen at the parole board hearing?
Mr. Simpson, 70, will appear before four members of Nevada’s parole board in Carson via teleconference from Lovelock Correctional Facility, where he’s been imprisoned.
Testimony is limited to Mr. Simpson, his representation, one of his supporters, and victims of the crime.
Continue reading the main story
After the hearing, the parole board members will meet privately and then vote.
How likely is he to be granted parole?
Among other factors, the parole board will consider whether Mr. Simpson shows remorse and how he has behaved in prison.
They are not supposed to consider Mr. Simpson’s 1995 trial in the killings of his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman, in which he was acquitted.
By all accounts Mr. Simpson has been a model prisoner, said Gabriel Grasso, who served as one of his lawyers in 2008.
“I would be shocked if he was denied. I really would be, ” Mr. Grasso said.
If paroled, when would he be released?
Oct. 1 at the earliest.

TRUMP CLEARED! What Tom Cotton Just Said to Hillary Will END Trump-Russia Investigation,"Home Uncategorized Culture War TRUMP CLEARED! What Tom Cotton Just Said to Hillary Will END Trump-Russia...
 
History is not sitting well with Hillary Clinton, especially after she posted that tweet and is being a complete hypocrite by blaming her loss on a number of things. Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) is certainly not letting her forget it, either.
On Wednesday, Cotton completely ripped the Senate Intel Committee on Russian interference during the 2016 election. After Cotton was asked about whether Trump is being used by Russia to disrupt our political system, WATCH Cotton turn it around and ask question to Hillary Clinton.
You might remember Hillary Tweeting THIS before the election, saying Trump would “undermine” our Democracy by not accepting the results.
Tom Cotton turned the question around on the Committee, asking if Hillary is the one doing the bidding of Russia by undermining our Democracy and delegitimizing President Trump. Cotton just proved how backwards and corrupt the Trump-Russia investigation is! WATCH this viral video then SHARE on Facebook!
“In response to whether or not Donald Trump had become an unwitting agent of Russia and their efforts to sow discord and discontent about our elections, you said that you declined to answer…
…Let’s look at this from a different perspective. Since her election defeat, Hillary Clinton has blamed her loss on the Russians, Vladimir Putin, the FBI agent James Comey, fake news, Wikileaks, Twitter, Facebook and my personal favorite, content farms in Macedonia.
In her blaming her loss on these actors, has Hillary Clinton become an unwitting agent of Russians’ goals in the United States.”
This is SUCH a brilliant question. Remember, before the election Hillary Clinton was saying Trump wouldn’t “accept” the results of the election and this was a threat to Democracy. HA HA! Now she is doing it.
See the video below for his full time in the hearing today:

State Passes New Law Deeming Shariah Law Illegal,"Home NEWS  
 
According to recent reports, Arkansas’ House has passed a bill that will allow state courts to use only the ‘american laws.’ This means that Sharia Law will not be allowed in the courtroom.
The bill passed with 63 to 24 votes and it will now travel to the Senate, who has the final vote.
If this bill passes with the Senate, it will set an example for other states to follow in an effort to preserve the rule of law.
Many people think that this will be a positive change for a nation that is scrambling to defend its values.
Arkansas Rep. Brandt Smith, a Republican from Jonesboro, sponsored the key legislation. The bill and everyone connected to it have been targets of critics who say the bill is intended to target Muslims.
HB-1041 “necessarily” includes Muslims by implication, which means slam and Sharia are in most ways inseparable. But, many are against Sharia law because they believe it’s the doorway into an anachronistic legal system that must be kept out of our courts.
Supporters of the ban believe it does not have any connections to Western values of individual freedom and human rights. Hasan Mahmud of Muslims Facing Tomorrow wrote:
“Sharia is more than stoning or amputating limbs or public beheading—Sharia is a spirit also. Its spirit is against current [Western] civilization. Sharia instigates its believers to destroy secular democracy (from within!) and establish so-called Islamic state because [the] law is pointless without a state.”

LOL: Liberal media has collective MELTDOWN after Trump slams CNN in Poland [VIDEO],"July 6, 2017 Clayton
While in Poland, President Trump wasn’t shy to express how he felt about the American media.
When asked about the whole “wrestling video” fiasco, our President pressed into the fake news network known as CNN.
“CNN has really taken it too seriously, and I think they have hurt themselves very badly” said the President on Thursday. “What we want to see in the United States is honest, beautiful, free, but honest press. We want to see fair press […] We don’t want fake news.”
Upon hearing this jab overseas, CNN and the liberal media had a collective meltdown (and it was hilarious).
First up, CNN themselves.
CNN senior White House correspondent Jim Acosta was the first to come unhinged following President Trump’s joint press conference with the Polish President.
Acosta immediately pounced on the President’s words, implying a “conservative” journalist was specifically instructed by the administration to ask Trump a question relating to CNN.
“Unfortunately, this was not a surprise at all that the President would take the first question from an American reporter during his foreign trip and that it would be from the friendly news media, a friendly reporter who teed up a question about CNN,” said Acosta.
Acosta wasn’t the only liberal media pundit to have a meltdown, no.
Liberal Joe Scarborough was also massively offended:
If you're just waking up, the president is on foreign soil attacking US intelligence patriots, the American free press & former presidents. pic.twitter.com/5AXyjwT7ag
— Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) July 6, 2017
Aw, poor baby. We hope his feelings aren’t too hurt.
Here are some other media freakouts, as pointed out by the Daily Caller:
“The President of the United States, representing the U.S. on foreign soil, attacks the American free press as ‘fake news,’” wrote NBC News editor Brad Jaffy, linking to a video of Trump’s comments.
“Stunning to see Trump attack a free press on foreign soil to a foreign leader who also regularly attacks the media,” said MSNBC producer Kyle Griffin.
“He’s overseas, ripping a free press and defending the country that interfered in our election,” complained Forbes contributor Mark Joyella. “Oh. And talking about how he won in November.”
“Trump attacking American media while overseas at the start of a global leaders conference is a new yet totally expected low,” wrote BuzzFeed’s Chris Geidner.
ABC News’ chief political analyst Matthew Dowd conceded that Trump gave a “good speech in Poland” but then added that the president “derails himself by questioning our own intelligence agencies, attacking Obama and free press.”
We’re so glad to see Trump telling the TRUTH about the American press overseas.

‘Get Out White Man’: Latino Community Attacks New Coffee Shop For “Appropriation”,"Posted by Anthony Cesario | Jun 26, 2017 | Liberal Corruption
A protester screaming at at a customer of Weird Wave Coffee (pictured above).
Earlier this year a new coffee shop, named Weird Wave Coffee, was opened in Boyle Heights, California. The coffee shop, which is owned by John Schwartz, Mario Chavarria and Jackson Defa, serves coffee from Heart Roasters of Portland, Oregon, and pastries from Homeboy Industries, which provides training and support to former gang members or previously incarcerated people. But apparently, this isn’t good enough for many living in Boyle Heights because they’re currently campaigning to have them closed.
One of the groups protesting the coffee shop is Defend Boyle Heights. They believe the owners should shut down the store and leave the community. On Facebook, they wrote, “we can’t let Boyle Heights become the new Highland Park, Echo Park or Silverlake! The vast majority – approximately 80-percent renters – can’t afford for that to happen.” The three cities mentioned were all recently been gentrified, and as a result, many low-income people were forced out of the neighborhood.
Boyle Heights residents protesting Weird Wave Coffee.
“Things will only escalate. Not because we want them too, but because this is literally a life or death, home or homeless, battle,” they continued, noting, “since the 1990s, Boyle Heights has struggled to get and keep authentically affordable housing. It’s not just about what a dozen of activists want; it’s about what all these residents who organize with all the groups that make up our coalition want.”
They added, “say no to Weird Wave Coffee! Stand with the low-income working class majority of Boyle Heights! This isn’t just about coffee; it’s about keeping Boyle Heights affordable! Dile no a los cocos! Gentrifiers are not welcomed in Boyle Heights! Fuera!”
Shortly after the group’s post on Facebook, angry residents went to the coffee shop and started harassing the people there. “I was able to visit this coffee shop, but not without getting threatened, insulted, and physically hurt on my way in,” recalled a customer on Instagram, noting, “I agree wholeheartedly with the concept of protesting and making one’s voices heard. However, I do not, in any way, agree with the concept of non-peaceful protesting.”
In response, the coffee shop released a statement. “Weird Wave Coffee is a company owned by three individuals committed to a fair and consistent approach to the grassroots enterprise of selling coffee,” explained the owners, adding, “we recognize the role a coffee shop plays in a community, both as an advocate for that community but also as a vendor who’s role in the local economy is impactful. At Weird Wave, our goal is largely to supply incredibly delicious coffee and non-alcoholic beverages to the community.”
John Schwarz, Mario Chavarria, and Jackson Defa, the co-owners of Weird Wave Coffee Brewers.
Their statement made it clear that they do whatever they can to not hurt the local community. “Weird Wave’s approach to doing business locally begins and ends with keeping the flow of money inside the community,” they pointed out, noting, “we take special pains to seek out vendors for our products who share our local-first approach.” Despite this, the residents still want them gone.
Unfortunately, this is not the first time the local community living in Boyle Heights has tried to drive out businesses. For instance, earlier this year, an art space called PSSST for was forced to close after harassment from protesters made it difficult for them to fundraise money. “The ongoing controversy surrounding art and gentrification in Boyle Heights caused PSSST to become so contested that we are unable to ethically and financially proceed with our mission,” stated the organizers at the time of the closing.
Boyle Heights Residents protesting an art space called PSSST.
“Our young nonprofit struggled to survive through constant attacks. Our staff and artists were routinely trolled online and harassed in-person. This persistent targeting, which was often highly personal in nature, was made all the more intolerable because the artists we engaged are queer, women, and/or people of color.” they added.
“While our closure might be applauded by some, it is not a victory for civil discourse and coalition building at a time when both are in short supply. The ongoing representation of a divisive battle–nonprofit art spaces versus the residents of Boyle Heights–resulted in the mischaracterization of PSSST as being fundamentally in opposition with the varied intersectional communities we aimed to support,” they continued, noting, “this made fundraising an impossibility. Without financial support, PSSST, a fledgling nonprofit, cannot survive.”
The authoritarian left must not be allowed to control the lives and businesses of others. If the situation was reversed, there’d likely be a massive amount of outrage. Conservatives should work together to push back against their bullying tactics. We need to show them that violence and intimidation won’t work.",Conservative Daily Post,1
3 Alabama Thugs Pepper WRONG Marine With 10 Too Many Bullets – Lived To Give Them BRUTAL Payback,"And today’s feel-good story of the day comes all the way from down in Theodore, Alabama. One of most, if not the most, right wing leaning states of the union.
A 62-year-old Marine Corps veteran who is currently battling colon cancer heard a knock on his door this past Thursday afternoon. As he went to answer it he had no clue he was about to have the fight of his life. Three thugs who were attempting to rob him shot him through his door window. The thugs used a 12 gauge shotgun loaded with buckshot which is normally used for hunting deer. This type of ammo thankfully isn’t as deadly to people as other types of ammo that can be used in a 12 gauge shotgun are.
The retired Marine Michael Irving was hit and quickly reached for his own gun. He shot the shooter, but as he lay on the ground one of his two other accomplices reached for the shotgun, so he shot that thug too. The second thug he had just shot begged Irvine not to shoot him again, so he replied to him to drop the gun. The punk didn’t so Irvin shot him again. After shooting both he looked over and saw a third punk trying to shoot him with a handgun that had fortunately jammed, so he shot her too. Now that’s what I call a fun afternoon don’t you think?
“I didn’t want to have to kill ’em”: Veteran talks about shooting suspected burglars
A Marine Corps veteran is telling FOX10 News how he got out of a violent burglary alive.
TRENDING ON FREEDOM DAILY
* Hollywood Movie Star Seth Rogen Just Attacked Trump Fan Who Was Stabbed 9 Times And In Critical Condition
It’s a follow up to a story we brought you as breaking news Thursday night, when a homeowner shot three suspected burglars in Theodore after they shot him first.
The homeowner is 62-year-old Michael Irving. FOX10 News Reporter Devan Coffaro sat down with him once he got home from the hospital Friday afternoon.
“I didn’t even know them,” said Irving. “Why me? Why shoot me?”
Irving was still in disbelief as he walked into his home — blood still covered the ground, and there was a bullet hole in both his door and his arm.
For him, the last 24-hours have been almost unreal, and it all started with a tap on his door.
“I walked right here to open the door, and that’s when he shot me right there. They cut loose on me, and that’s when I went to the cabinet here and back behind the coffee was an old time pistol,” said Irving. “I opened the door and smoked ’em.”
Mobile County Sheriff’s deputies say on the other side of that door armed with a shotgun and a handgun were Chasatie Dulabhan, Casey Ray Gann, and Joseph Heathcock. Investigators say it was an attempted robbery, and clearly they chose the wrong house. Irving managed to shoot and injure all three of them.
“I tried not to shoot any of them in the chest. I didn’t want to have to kill ’em.”
Two of the suspects fled and left one woman behind, but they didn’t make it very far. They eventually had to stop at a Dollar General two miles away and wait for help. All three suspects were first taken to the hospital for their injuries and then arrested.
As for Irving, he’s being hailed as a local hero for defending himself. He was outnumbered, outgunned, and has been battling colon cancer for the past two years. He says you never mess with a former Marine.
“I learned that in the Marine Corps – ‘react and do’ before you get scared,” said Irving.
He was robbed a few weeks ago, targeted for his cancer medication. Deputies believe that robbery was committed by at least one of the same three suspects.
After that incident, Irving installed new Plexiglass on his door — something he believes helped save his life.
“Where the bullet hole is, you can see how thick that glass is and that’s what saved me, because it slowed down the buckshot enough.”
Irving says someone up above must have been watching over him.
“If I hadn’t of moved just a little bit, it would have hit me in the chest and sternum and caught me in the heart.”
All three robbery suspects are in Metro Jail.
So far, only Heathcock and Gann have been in court and a judge denied bond for both of them. Heathcock is charged with robbery, assault 2nd, and shooting into an occupied building. Gann is charged with robbery. Dulabhan is charged with burglary, robbery, assault 2nd, and shooting into an occupied building.
Deputies say they are still looking for a fourth male suspect who may have been the getaway driver.
The suspects are confirmed to be 19-year-old Joseph Heathcock and 29-year-old Casey Ray Gann, who were both denied bail. And 24-year-old Chasatie Dulabhan who still remains in the hospital with none life threatening injuries. Authorities said they are actively searching for a fourth suspect in the case who was apparently driving the getaway car.
Moral of the story, don’t mess with a United States Marine, no matter how old or sick that Marine may be!

"India, Russia Sign ‘Military Cooperation Roadmap’","New Delhi and Moscow are set to deepen bilateral defense ties in the coming years.
Indian Defense Minister Arun Jaitley and his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu signed a military cooperation roadmap during the 17th meeting of the Russian-Indian inter-governmental commission for military-technical cooperation, which took place in Moscow, Russia on June 23, according to Russian media reports.
“We are determined to go ahead with building up cooperation in order to enhance the combat readiness of both countries’ armed forces and to exchange experience in various defense-related matters,” the Russian defense minister said following the conclusion of the agreement, TASS news agency reports.
The roadmap is to become the basic document in planning bilateral contacts, but Shoigu did not provide details on the contents.

Shoigu also emphasized that with India’s accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, new venues for cooperation will be possible. “We welcome India’s accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization as it opens up new prospects for cooperation,” he said.
“Over the past years, Russia and India have been able to develop particularly close friendly relations, consistent and trust based,” the Russian defense minister added. “It was once again confirmed at the recent meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which took place in St. Petersburg on June 1.”
During their June 1 meeting, the Indian and Russian heads of government agreed to push for “qualitatively higher level of military-to-military cooperation” within the framework of the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership between the two countries, according to a joint statement issued by Modi and Putin following the annual India-Russia summit in June.
India and Russia are also set to upgrade joint military exercises. “Military cooperation is a major component and platform of Russian-Indian strategic interaction. Joint military exercises are the most important aspect of this,” Shoigu said on Wednesday.
As I explained last month, this year’s iteration of the Indo-Russian Indra bilateral military exercise will for the first time involve personnel from all three service branches from both countries. Russia and India have held the Indra exercise since 2003.
One of the major recent stumbling blocks to deeper Indo-Russian military ties remains defense industry cooperation, as I pointed out in May:
India-Russia defense relations have somewhat cooled over the last months with the cancellation of an aircraft deal and continuing disagreements over one of their most prestigious defense projects — the co-development and production of the Sukhoi/HAL Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft (FGFA), known in India as the Perspective Multi-role Fighter (PMF).
On Wednesday, the Indian defense minister made an effort to mend fences by encouraging Russian defense firms to continue to continue their engagement in India. “I invite Russian companies to come forward with proposals for technology transfer to Indian companies and facilitate manufacturing of more advanced components/parts and subsystems. This can start with platforms of Russian origin where the requirement is in large numbers and is recurring in nature,” Jaitley said.
Last month, India issued a new policy that will allow private firms to enter into agreements as “strategic partners” with non-Indian original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for certain types of military systems including tanks, aircraft, and submarines as part of the Indian government’s “Make in India” initiative.
“Here again, Russia as India’s largest, oldest and most trusted partner in defense hardware and equipment, would have a comparative advantage in partnering with Indian companies for realizing ‘Make in India’ potential in defense production,” Jaitley said, according to the Press Trust of India.
Among other things, Russia and India are in the final stages of negotiations over the delivery date of new missile air defense systems and four Admiral Grigorovich-class frigates. Both sides also signed an agreement for India to lease an inactive Akula-class multi-purpose nuclear submarine last year. Rosoboronexport, Russian Helicopters, and India’s Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) have also agreed to create a joint venture for the production of 140 Ka-226T helicopters in October 2016. (60 additional helicopters will be received in fly-away condition from Russia.)",The Diplomat,0
Female genital mutilation now a felony in Michigan,"July 12 (UPI) -- Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder signed 13 bills pertaining to female genital mutilation, which is now a felony in the state punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
In signing the legislation Tuesday, Snyder said, ""Those who commit these horrendous crimes should be held accountable for their actions, and these bills stiffen the penalties for offenders while providing additional support to victims. This legislation is an important step toward eliminating this despicable practice in Michigan while empowering victims to find healing and justice.""
The statutes, begun in House Bills 4636, 4637, 4639, 4641, 4642, 4661 and 4690 and Senate Bills 337, 338, 368, and 369, collectively make performing or assisting with female genital mutilation a state felony with a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. They also provide penalties for transporting a person to a state for the procedure; set the statute of limitations for the crime to 10 years; include a process for revocation of the medical license of a person who performs the procedure; allows victims to file civil lawsuits and create an education outreach program to publicize the health risks of female genital mutilation.
The rush for legislation in the state against female genital mutilation, the practice of ritual cutting or removal of external female genitalia, was prompted by the case of two doctors and the wife of a physician who face federal charges for the genital cuttings of two girls, each 7, earlier this year in Livonia, Mich. The defendants are each a member of a small Indian Muslim sect which regards the practice as a religious ritual.",United Press International – US,0

HAMBURG — The world's wealthiest nations reached a near-unanimous agreement Saturday that the Paris climate agreement is ""irreversible,"" signing on to a document that urges the developed world to move ""swiftly toward its full implementation.""
All of them, that is, except the United States.
The lack of agreement was widely expected, given President Trump's decision last month to withdraw from the international climate agreement negotiated and signed under President Obama.
But the final communique of the G-20 summit in Hamburg on Saturday showed that Trump and the rest of the world were unable to find a way to accommodate his insistence that the United States is free to renege on agreements made by the previous administration.
The deal calls on each member nation to meet self-defined targets to reduce carbon emissions, with a goal of keeping the average increase in global temperatures under 2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels.
""We take note of the decision of the United States of America to withdraw from the Paris Agreement,"" the communique read. ""The leaders of the other G-20 members state that the Paris Agreement is irreversible.""
Putin says Trump satisfied with denials of Russian involvement in U.S. election
Ivanka Trump literally takes president's seat among world leaders at G-20
The communique included what appeared to be a U.S.-written dissent to the agreement, saying that the United States ""affirms its strong commitment to an approach that lowers emissions while supporting economic growth and improving energy security needs.""
The other signatories were clearly disappointed in the U.S. refusal to sign on. ""Where there is no consensus, even the dissent must appear in the communique,"" said German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the host of the G-20 summit and a driving force behind the communique.
Gary Cohn, Trump's chief economic adviser, compared the dispute to 20 friends trying to agree on where to have dinner. ""We do go out of our way to say in there that we do support the environment,"" he said.
Merkel, this year's host for the annual meeting of the world's 20 largest economies, had set out an agenda for the summit that included climate change, trade and migration.
And on those other issues, Merkel found a way to accommodate Trump's view of U.S. national interests.
• On trade, the document said member countries would push for free markets, but also ""strive to ensure a level playing field."" It recognized the legitimate right of counties to retaliate against unfair trade practices.
• On migration, the 20 countries expressed support for ""those countries that choose to develop pathways for migration."" But it also recognized ""the sovereign right of states to manage and control their borders.""",USA Today – Washington,0
WATCH: Ted Cruz speaks to reporters about the Senate Healthcare bill… [FULL PRESSER],"Jun. 22, 2017 3:21 pmJun. 22, 2017 3:25 pm by The Right Scoop • No Comments
Ted Cruz spoke with reporters a very few minutes ago about his issues with the Senate Healthcare bill and what he needs to see from the bill before he can vote on it:
You should watch the entire clip, but Cruz’s biggest issue is that this bill doesn’t do enough to make insurance premiums go down. He makes the case that this result wouldn’t just bad for the American people, but if Republicans don’t fix the problem, it will be very bad for them too.
In other words he’s trying to appeal to what Senators love so much, their power, in order to get them to fix this bill.
Cruz emphasized that he knows this is only a draft and that significant changes will be made, but also that he really believes that they can the bill to a point where everyone can vote ‘yes’.
So I guess we’ll see. Watch the clip for much more.",TheRightScoop,1

A powerful car bombing near the office of the provincial police chief in southwestern Pakistan on Friday killed 11 people and wounded 20, officials said.
The explosion near the police chief's office in Quetta, the capital of Baluchistan province, was powerful enough that it was heard across the city, shattering windows of nearby buildings, said police spokesman Shahzada Farhat.
Wasim Beg, a spokesman at a government hospital, said the death toll from the bombing rose to 11. He said some people remained in critical condition.
TV footage showed several badly damaged cars and a road littered with broken glass.
Anwarul Haq Kakar, a spokesman for the provincial government, said the bomb was planted in a moving car, but officers were trying to determine whether it was a suicide attack.
No one claimed responsibility for the attack but Kakar blamed neighboring India for the blast. He offered no evidence.
On Thursday, Pakistan said that an Indian naval officer, Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and sabotage, had petitioned for mercy.
Jadhav, who Pakistan said had crossed into Baluchistan from neighboring Iran, was arrested in March 2016 and sentenced to death in April.
In New Delhi, the Ministry of External Affairs insisted Jadhav was sentenced on ""concocted charges"" and expressed doubts about the existence of the petition for mercy. It also reiterated that the proceedings against Jadhav have been shrouded ""in opacity.""
Baluchistan has long been the scene of a low-level insurgency by Baluch nationalists and separatists, who want a bigger share of the regional resources or outright independence, but also other attacks, mostly blamed on the Pakistani Taliban.

"Narendra Modi Israel visit: PM speaks to Indian diaspora, from PIO, OCI cards, Air India Tel Aviv airlink to setting up an Indian cultural centre, here are top 10 quotes","PM Narendra Modi addressing the Indian diaspora in Israel. (ANI)
Narendra Modi Israel visit: Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to Twitter today in the wake of his crucial meet with Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu and indicated exactly how important he thought it was. In a series of tweets, PM Modi summed up the day and highlighted his views. The first one indicated exactly what the underlying theme was. PM tweeted, “My talks with PM Netanyahu focussed on India-Israel Friendship as well as how our ties can help further world peace and stability.” He then elaborated on that by saying, “Areas where the India-Israel cooperation can further scale up include agriculture, water resources, science and technology. Today’s deliberations also included ways to deepen trade and investment flows between our nations.” After setting the agenda, PM indicated that he expects progress in the relationship between the 2 countries by saying, “Am confident that the strength of India-Israel links, old and new, will hold us in good stead as we forge a partnership for the 21st century.” He also described what he went through after meeting Baby Moshe whose parents were killed during the Mumbai attack. He said, “It was an emotional moment to meet young Moshe, his maternal and paternal grandparents and Ms Sandra Solomon, his nanny.” This was before he spoke to the Indian diaspora in Israel later in the evening. Here are the top 10 PM Modi quotes during his speech to the Indian diaspora:
1. Shalom; for the first time in 70 years a prime minister of India has come here. Our ties with Israel are about mutual trust and friendship.
2. Making consistent efforts to double farmers’ income by 2022, policies are being formulated to ensure that happens quickly. Have to fulfill dream of own house, water, electricity for poor households in India by 2022.
3. My talks with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu focussed on India Israel Friendship as well as how our ties can help further world peace and stability.
4. Make in India has become a brand now, taking everyone by surprise.
5. My government’s mantra is reform, perform and transform. Most recently GST was implemented in India. I call GST ‘Goods and Simple Tax’. With GST we are aiming towards the economic integration of India.
6. We will start a Delhi-Mumbai-Tel Aviv airlink connection to ensure that the link between the two countries progresses at an even faster pace.
6. Israel has surprised everyone with its new innovations in almost every field be it solar panel, solar window, agro biotechnology.
7. I want to give you some good news. Indian diaspora is facing a lot of OCI, PIO cards difficulties. It can no longer be that India can say no to giving you these cards. Now, even Indian jewish community who have undergone compulsory army service too will get an these cards. Because of this we know problems were faced but this will no longer happen.
8. To increase cultural integration with Israel, PM announced that ‘we will build an Indian Cultural Centre here.’
9. Have to fulfill dream of own house, water, electricity for poor households in India by 2022.
10. Due to the steps taken by his government, ease of doing business has improved. So many complex laws have been trashed. Now whenever anyone has to establish a factory or business, it takes no more than a day or so to do so. Once it took as many as 600 days to get environment clearances in India. Now this has been reduced to just 180 days and it will fall further.",Financial Express,0
Bill Cosby Narrowly Avoids Destruction As Something Unexpected Happens On Jury,"Posted by April Horning | Jun 23, 2017 | Liberal Corruption
Bill Cosby shares hung jury as a victory, but he narrowly avoided prison.
The trial of superstar Bill Cosby has captivated the American public. Is this a case of a celebrity abusing his power to take whatever he wants? Is Cosby being targeted for just being a successful black man as his defense team wants everyone to believe? Many question why the alleged victims took so long to come out and push for the truth. After recent jury deliberations, evidence is emerging that Cosby came very close to being found guilty on at least two charges.
The jury tasked with deciding the fate of the elderly television star worked through 50 hours of deliberation before hitting a wall. According to one juror who spoke to a local news crew, the talks in the jury room often broke down into an emotional battle. The juror explained:
“They were just literally walking in circles where they were standing because they were losing their minds. People would just start crying out of nowhere. We wouldn’t even be talking about [the case], and people would just start crying. At one point, a male juror even punched a concrete wall, possibly breaking his pinky knuckle.”
Cosby appeared very happy after the jury failed.
After 50 hours of talks, two jurors held up the verdict. In most cases, to come down with a guilty verdict, everyone must agree. As the anonymous source shared, 10 of the 12 jurors were ready to deliver a guilty verdict on two charges. This meant that a mere two jurors kept Cosby out of prison.
The jury was considering several charges and had already decided that they were going to acquit on one of the charges listed. They were not able to find Cosby guilty of all of the charges, but according to the juror:
“…he vote was 10-2 to convict him on charges that he digitally penetrated Constand without her consent, and 10-2 that he gave her drugs that substantially impaired her ability to resist. The vote was 11-1 to acquit Cosby on a charge that he digitally penetrated Constand while she was unconscious or unaware, the juror said.
The juror who spoke to WPXI said that the 10-2 split happened at one point but that jurors changed their votes before a tally could be sent to the judge.”
With a split of 10-2, it is not clear why it was also reported that some of the jurors changed their votes before the tally was given to the judge. Another report surfaced that pointed to the jury being an actual split and staying right at 5 to 7. If the jury was motivated to change the votes to get closer to a real “hung jury” it might make sense that these numbers were changed before going back to the judge.
The jury was ready to convict Cosby on charges tied to drugging the victim and taking advantage of her. As word came down that the majority of the votes were against the star, the media began to push for the names of the jury to be made public. At first, this was denied, but within days the jury names were released.
It is still not clear which panel members were the hold-outs. While individual members of the group are allowed to speak about their actions, they have been cautioned about other information that they are not authorized to share. According to a report about the jury:
“After requests from media outlets, including CNN, Judge Steven O’Neill decided to release the names, while keeping the jury deliberations confidential, according to a court document released Wednesday.
The document states that a disclosure of anything said or done during deliberations “would have a chilling effect upon future jurors in this case and their ability to deliberate freely.”
Prosecutors have said they will retry the case. The court emphasized that jurors are not allowed to disclose the opinions and thoughts of their fellow jurors as well as any arguments or comments made, or votes cast, by fellow jurors during deliberations.”
As the public awaits the next trial, it will be interesting to see if this first hurdle changes the way the defense team approaches the case. While many around Cosby saw this as a victory, he came very close to going to prison. This was not a win for Cosby or really anyone. There is still no closure for the victims, but perhaps a bit of hope as they heard the verdict was within reach.",Conservative Daily Post,1
Media MELTDOWN after Trump tweets CNN “body slam” video,"Yesterday, Col. West wrote here about President Trump’s feud with MSNBC and his continuing commentary about CNN’s “fake news.” Col. West implored the president to stop “punching down” and instead use his bully pulpit for policy discussions rather than bullying.
Clearly, that has fallen on deaf ears.
This morning, Trump tweeted a video of himself punching a man with a CNN logo on his head. The doctored video came from 2007 when Trump appeared at Wrestlemania 23 in the “Battle of the Billionaires” match against Vince McMahon. Both Trump and McMahon chose wrestlers to represent them in the ring, but engaged in some fisticuffs outside the ring. The video was first posted on Reddit.

Overnight, Trump tweeted some defense of his use of Twitter against those who say it’s not “presidential.”
My use of social media is not Presidential – it’s MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL. Make America Great Again!

Regardless of the questionable taste of posting such a video (and remember, this comes after Kathy Griffin’s severed head, Stephen Colbert’s “cock holster” and other representations of Trump assassination), the media was immediately triggered, saying it incited violence against them.
Per the Daily Caller, “It is a sad day when the President of the United States encourages violence against reporters,” CNN said in a statement responding to the tweet.
ABC News’ chief political analyst Matthew Dowd claimed Trump is “advocating violence against media” and demanded Republican leaders “put country over party” in response to the fake video of fake wrestling.
“Around the world, journalists are murdered with impunity on a regular basis,” Poynter managing editor Ben Mullin gravely stated. “This isn’t funny.”
CNN commentator Ana Navarro called the tweet “an incitement to violence” in an appearance on ABC News. “He is going to get somebody killed in the media,” she claimed.
ABC News’ Martha Raddatz took the fake video seriously in an interview with Homeland Security adviser Thomas Bossert. “That seems like a threat,” Raddatz asserted. “No one would perceive that as a threat,” Bossert replied.
Whatcha think folks, is the president engaging in a little calculated entertainment, or is this rock bottom?

So the Norks launched some more missiles in a challenge to South Korea and the rest of the rational world, and Trump went straight to his twitter account to react.
North Korea has just launched another missile. Does this guy have anything better to do with his life? Hard to believe that South Korea…..
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2017
“Does this guy have anything better to do with his life”? It’s like we’re in a horrible unfunny episode of Seinfeld.
….and Japan will put up with this much longer. Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2017
Wasn’t “this guy” Trump the one who said he was giving up on China and that they had done all they could do, even after he made trade concessions in order to secure peace in the Korean Peninsula?
Now he’s going back to China? Amazing.
Here’s more on the launch that went out in the last hour or so:
North Korea on Tuesday launched yet another ballistic missile in the direction of Japan, South Korean officials said, part of a string of recent test-firings as the North works to build a nuclear-tipped missile that could reach the United States.
The South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that the launch, which came before the U.S. celebration of its national independence, was made from North Phyongan province. Other details were scarce. It wasn’t immediately clear if this was a routine firing of a short-range missile or an attempt to perfect North Korea’s longer-range missiles.

Katie Flores Calms Her Baby By Showing Him A Picture Of His Father,"Little Jackson wasn’t having a good day and it seemed Mom didn’t know how to stop him from crying. How many of you have been in this situation?
I had twin girls so please understand I know what dueling crying babies sound like. There is actually no solution to stopping a baby from crying. It’s a trial-and-error duty but sooner or later, you find the right mix.
In the story below, Katie Flores heard her baby crying and just like any good mom would do, she allowed her instincts to take charge to find the solution. Reminder: Not everyone can calm a screaming baby. It takes skill and luck and Katie had them both.
Immediately, Jackson’s big, blue eyes are transfixed on the image. Flores angled the camera to show that on screen was a photo of Jackson sitting in his daddy’s lap.
He let out a small giggle when he saw his dad and the tears were instantly gone. It was as if the fit had never happened.
“Who is that, Jackson?” Flores asked her son. Jackson was too mesmerized to even look up at her when she spoke to him.
Flores captioned the video, “a picture of his daddy always calms him down.” It seems like this is a tried and true trick that she has used more than once.
This was a great video and one that probably made you smile in a huge way. Daddy’s photo is always a great idea to help calm a baby’s crying spell. I enjoyed watching this and I hope you did as well.
Share this great video on your Facebook/Twitter timeline and add your comments below whether you have been in a situation like this before and how did you stop your child from crying.

Puerto Rico Governor Appoints Delegation to Lobby Congress for Statehood,"* Puerto Rican Gov. Ricky Rosselló has appointed seven representatives to meet with members of Congress in Washington, DC to lobby for statehood. If Congress votes to admit Puerto Rico as the 51st state, Rosselló has proposed that his seven appointed representatives represent Puerto Rico in Congress (two US senators and five members of the House of Representatives).
* On 8 June, Rosselló signed House Bill 876, which allows him to appoint seven representatives to go to Washington to lobby Congress for the admission of Puerto Rico as the 51st state. Puerto Rico’s plan is based on Tennessee’s process for gaining statehood in 1796, known as “The Tennessee Plan.”
* Last Monday, Rosselló announced the appointments of former Govs. Carlos Romero Barceló and Pedro Rosselló González, former president of the Puerto Rican Senate Charlie Rodriguez Colon, and former MLB player Iván “Pudge” Rodríguez to form the Equality Commission for Puerto Rico, which will will lobby on behalf of Puerto Rican statehood.
* If Puerto Rico is admitted as a state, Barceló will serve as one of Rosselló’s two appointments to the US Senate.
* Similarly, Rosselló designated Gonzalez, Colon, and Rodriquez as three of his five appointments to the US House of Representatives.
* On 10 July, Roselló announced his remaining appointments: former Gov. Luis Fortuño, Major General (ret.) Felix Santoni, and the national committeewoman of the Republican Party, Zoraida Fonalledas (the second US Senate nominee).
* John Mark Hansen, the distinguished service professor of political science at the University of Chicago, told   that, if Puerto Rico does become a state, Gov. Rosselló does not have the constitutional authority to appoint a delegation to serve as representatives in the US House. He wrote in an email:
“The Constitution specifies that members of the House of Representatives are to be elected ‘by the People of the several States’ (Article I, section 2). Senators can be appointed, depending on state law. In every case of a state newly admitted to the Union that I know about, including Alaska and Hawaii, US Representatives were elected, either in a scheduled election or a special election. Both houses have the constitutional power to ‘judge the Election, Returns, and Qualifications of its own Members’ (Article I, section 5) and they have on numerous occasions declined to seat an elected representative because of some electoral impropriety… it’s hard to imagine that the House would overturn two centuries of precedent (and the protocols followed after the admission of 34 more states) and agree to seat members who have been appointed.”
Puerto Rico’s current status
* Puerto Rico is currently an unincorporated, organized US territory with commonwealth status, according to the CIA Factbook.
* Those born on the island receive US citizenship, and the United States provides the island with military protection.
* Puerto Rico does not enjoy the same rights as US states (such as Congressional representation and participation in presidential elections), and its citizens “generally do not pay federal income tax on income they earn in the Commonwealth,” according to the US Government Accountability Office.
* Jennifer Gonzalez-Colon is the Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, a non-voting position in the US House of Representatives. In January, she introduced H.R. 260, which seeks to “enable the admission of the territory of Puerto Rico into the Union as a State.” The bill claims that an “overwhelming majority of the United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico want to replace territory status with a permanent form of government that provides for equality and for democratic representation in the making of their national laws.”
* According to the Government Development Bank of Puerto Rico, “as of July 31, 2016, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of debt of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities was approximately $71.5 billion.”
* The report states that Puerto Rico’s “ratio of tax-supported debt to revenue is more than double that of Hawaii, the state with the highest debt-to-revenue ratio, and almost seven times the US State median.”
* On 2 May, Gov. Rosselló announced that he had filed the debt crisis into federal bankruptcy court — making Puerto Rico “the largest government to seek refuge from its creditors in US history,” according to the New York Times.
* On 11 June, Puerto Rico voted on a referendum to decide the future status of the territory. The ballot had three options: statehood, independence/free association, or current status. The results of the election do not force Congress to take any action. Of the 23% of eligible citizens who participated, 97% of voters chose statehood.
* In November, Rosselló won the Puerto Rico gubernatorial election while campaigning on promoting Puerto Rico statehood. He received 42% of the vote. The runner up won 39%.
* Article IV, Section III of the Constitution gives Congress the power to admit a new state into the Union.
* Addressing a congressional vote on statehood, Federico de Jesús — a former Obama administration and Puerto Rico government official — told NBC News that he believes “this is as close to dead on arrival as you can get.”
“The people of Puerto Rico have already chosen that we don’t want to be a colonial territory and that we want to be a state. And now we’re actually pushing forward another plebiscite on June 11 so that we can ratify that petition. I think Puerto Rico becoming a state would fulfill the destiny of 3.5 million American citizens that live in Puerto Rico.”
* In April, Rosselló delivered a speech called “Moving Puerto Rico Forward” to the Heritage Foundation. Speaking on statehood, he said:
“Allow us [Puerto Ricans] to have a path forward so that the people of Puerto Rico can decide. Allow us to have a path forward so that we can, as US citizens, keep working for this nation, but as part of the United States if our people so choose to do so. Please allow us to have the opportunities to have the runway”
* Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair Tom Perez endorsed Puerto Rican statehood. He wrote in an email to Politico that he “believes Puerto Ricans should have the same rights as those on the mainland and that his personal view is that statehood is the best method to provide full representation in government and equal rights.”
“The voters who participated in Puerto Rico’s status referendum expressed an unambiguous desire to continue seeking a future in common with the United States as an equal member of our union. I hope Congress and the Administration will listen to those voices and enable Puerto Rico to become the fifty-first state. Its people – already American citizens – deserve full and equal representation in the Congress and equal treatment by federal agencies.”
Democrats are trying to bail out insurance companies from disastrous #ObamaCare, and Puerto Rico with your tax dollars. Sad!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 26, 2017
* Former Puerto Rican Gov. Aníbal Acevedo Vilá wrote an op-ed for The Hill against Puerto Rico Statehood. He wrote that the admission of Puerto Rico will change the definition of the United States from “a nation-state, into a multi-national state. Although the US is a nation of immigrants and different minorities reside within its borders, its objective since its foundation has been that they all amalgamate into one nation, in what is known colloquially as the famous ‘melting pot.’ Since its inception, the American nation has had on its official seal the following motto: ‘e pluribus unum’, which in Latin means, ‘from the many, one.’ That would change dramatically if Puerto Rico were to become a state.”
* He continued to address Puerto Rico’s economic crisis, referring to Congress’ treatment of the island as colonial, but that “HR 260 is step in the wrong direction.”
“If Puerto Rico became a state, its economy and culture would be incredible outliers: It is twice as poor as the poorest of the 50 states, and it would of course be the first Spanish-speaking one. Statehood would remove some of the competitive benefits the island currently enjoys — protection of the United States and its laws without paying income taxes, for instance — in exchange for an inordinately generous welfare state.”
“This vote was a waste of precious resources at a time of severe fiscal constraints. Sadly, today’s vote will thus go down in history as yet another non-binding glorified poll with no real effect on resolving Puerto Rico’s relationship with the United States.”

EU states have right to ban Uber: top lawyer,"Luxembourg – EU member states can ban ride-hailing pioneer Uber without informing the European Commission because at heart it is an ordinary transport company under their jurisdiction, a top EU lawyer said Tuesday.
San Francisco-based Uber insists it is a service, not a transport provider, connecting riders with freelance drivers directly and much more cheaply than traditional cab companies.
But critics and competitors say this allows it to dodge costly regulation and several countries, led by France, have banned its low-cost UberPop service as a result.
Uber France challenged the ban, saying it amounted to regulation of an information company which Paris should have first lodged with the Commission, the European Union’s administrative arm.
However, Maciej Szpunar, an advocate general with the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice, said Uber was in fact an ordinary transport company and so member states could go ahead and regulate its activities without notifying the Commission in advance.

VIDEO: NYC Man Carrying Trash Can Fights Man Wielding Machete,"by Ethan Sabo | Jul 20, 2017
 
This fight contains many titillating elements.
Two big gladiators, one white and one black square off in the naked city. Separated by skin color and opportunity, as one man had a car and the other didn’t.
Watch as the car owner (the white man, of course!) wields a machete at the poor black man holding a trash can.
Wednesday morning 6:50am July 19 on the UWS. Man with machete in altercation with man in red. @NY1 @DNAinfoNY @NYDailyNews pic.twitter.com/kn9te7ugTm
— Paul Tena (@paultena) July 19, 2017
Police told the New York Post that the brawl took place on Broadway and West 94th Street in New York City’s Upper West Side. That’s right, New York.
Notice how the media describes the incident:
A man wielding a machete faced off against a guy armed with a garbage can on an Upper West Side street Wednesday morning — and their epic brawl was caught on camera.
A guy “armed with a garbage can?” From where I sit, the only guy armed is the man “wielding a machete!”
Let me ask you. In a fight, would you rather have a trash can or a machete? Unless the fight is over garbage cleanup, I’ll take the machete.
Apparently, the fight started over nonsense.
Picture a 35-year-old black man walking along the street looking at his phone, minding his own business. He’s verbally accosted by a man driving a car, who yells something like, “Pay attention you moron!”
That’s what the driver Louis Roman, 40, did.
He made a comment about the black dude not paying attention and threatened him by flashing a gun clip.
First of all, why involve yourself in something that’s none of your business. And then secondly do the cowardly thing and flash a gun clip.
I’m not sure why a pedestrian “armed” only with a trash can would throw the can at a man who might have a gun. But that’s what happened.
Witness Paul Tena, who tweeted out footage of the fight, told the West Side Rag blog he turned on his camera when he saw the pedestrian respond by throwing a garbage can at Roman’s car — and the driver emerged with a machete and chased the trash thrower back to the median.
The clip starts with the pedestrian dragging another garbage pail across the busy street as Roman waggles the blade on the sidewalk — while his female companion tries to put herself between the two.
She seems to talk her blade-brandishing pal into getting back in their car, but when the trash man tries to get in too, the driver rushes out and hurls the machete at him.
The garbage guy blocks the flying blade with the can, then returns fire with the pail.
Both unarmed, the pair briefly engage in fisticuffs in the middle of the street before Roman once again tries to get back in his car — only for his foe to pick up a bottle that had spilled out of the trash and hurl it into the vehicle.
Roman lobs his own piece of trash in return, then finally gets back in the vehicle for good.

“High and Mighty” – The Unfair Labeling of #NeverTrump Voters,"I had to take a few days to simmer on this one, because this hits me deep.
To begin, let me address my critics, many who are supposed to stand as my brothers and sisters in Christ, but who have a problem with my outspoken rejection of Donald Trump.
I have heard the terms “self-righteous” and “high and mighty” far too many times, in regards to my opinion of our president.
Oddly enough, I don’t recall hearing that from anyone when I held the same opinion of Barack Obama.
Make no mistake, my position against Donald Trump is not the typical #NeverTrump platform. I don’t reject him because I would rather have Ted Cruz (who lost me early in the primaries) or Marco Rubio, or even Rick Perry, who most here know I always felt was our most experienced and capable option.
More than the very surface details that are apparent to everyone, namely, Trump hasn’t got a clue how to do this job, for me it has a spiritually-rooted base.
I could not trust a man with the sacred trust of my vote who violated every tenet of decency and my faith (and for the record, the same goes for Hillary Clinton).
1 Corinthians 5:11 AMP says, “ But actually, I have written to you not to associate with any so-called [Christian] brother if he is sexually immoral or greedy, or is an idolater [devoted to anything that takes the place of God], or is a reviler [who insults or slanders or otherwise verbally abuses others], or is a drunkard or a swindler—you must not so much as [a]eat with such a person.
Does that sound like anyone we know?
This verse is speaking of anyone who claims to be a Christian, but continues on in those ways that God has called corrupt. The reason is to protect the reputation of the Church.
After all, if a lost and hurting world see those who claim to follow Christ acting as bad as what’s out there in the world, what is their motivation to call on the name of the Lord and be saved? Saved from what?
The Body of Christ is to be an alternative of peace, a beacon of hope – not business as usual.
Military Judge Gives Bowe Bergdahl A Lot Of Bad News
Also, 1 John 1:8 AMP says, “If we say we have no sin [refusing to admit that we are sinners], we delude ourselves and the truth is not in us. [His word does not live in our hearts.]”
Donald Trump said publicly during the primaries that he had never asked God for forgiveness, because he’d never done anything to need forgiveness for.
According to the Word of God, Trump is a liar, and there is no truth in him.
BUT WE’RE NOT ELECTING A PASTOR!
Yes. I have heard that, as well. Often.
And it is true. We weren’t electing a pastor, but we were required, if we were claiming to be Christians, to apply the Word of God to our vote.
If the Bible tells us not to even eat with such a person, how much more does that apply to trusting such a person with the sacred trust of our vote?
I couldn’t do it, and I have no regrets.
I also have no regrets with taking a firm stand against the man now, even after the damage is already done.
None of this is to suggest I don’t pray for the man. I absolutely do, as well as all of our elected representatives.
My problem is in how Christians supporting a man like Trump damage their witness to the world. The Bible gave instruction for just this reason.
How much more damage is done when high profile Christian leaders abandon all godly reason to back a man such as Trump, no matter the cost?
I’m revisiting all this now because of one, disappointing instance from this past weekend.
Franklin Graham, son of legendary evangelist, Billy Graham, and head of Samaritan’s Purse, may not have been one of the more vocal Christian “leaders” supporting Trump through the primaries, and then the election, but he’s all in, now.
The media and enemies of @POTUS Trump have tried to drive a wedge between Russia and the U.S. https://t.co/x2ZCANjo38
— Franklin Graham (@Franklin_Graham) July 6, 2017
Vladimir Putin has journalists and political opponents murdered. He is an oppressive “strongman,” and there needs to be a chasm between our government and Russia.
Graham’s Trumpian turn against the U.S. media and talk of “enemies” of Trump, while promoting unity between our government and a nation that is hostile to ours, as well as to God is a new level of disappointing.
Graham, like many Christians, let fear guide his vote. They have grown so used to the way the world works, that they have forgotten their call to be courageous and to stand firm in the Lord.
“But the Supreme Court…”
One more verse of Scripture, Matthew 5:13 NIV, “You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.”
In Jesus’ day, salt was used not just to flavor food, but to preserve. As the “salt of the earth,” Christians are called to preserve the gospel and the values instilled in us by Christ, while moving in a secular world.
Am I self-righteous for clinging to that? Well, the Word said I am made righteous by the blood of Christ and Christ alive in me, so it’s not “self” righteousness. I am broken and useless without Him. I recognize that, so how could I trade that off so cheaply?
Am I “high and mighty,” as so many have flung at me?
I am a child of El Elyon, the Most High God. He is high and He is mighty, so not me. I’m just doing what I can to cling to truth, not seeking the world’s approval, but trusting God.
This is my #NeverTrump position. It has not been entered into lightly. It is not a position of grudge, but one of faith.
Maybe some who are lumping #NeverTrump in with liberal Democrats and enemies of state need to consider that it’s more than a simple “dislike” of Donald Trump or partisan angst that motivates some of us.",RedState,1
8th person at Trump Tower meeting identified,"Washington (CNN)The eighth person who attended the June 2016 meeting with Donald Trump Jr. at Trump Tower is a senior vice president at the company founded by the Russian oligarch who initiated the meeting, CNN has learned.
Ike Kaveladze's identity was confirmed by his attorney, Scott Balber.
Kaveladze is a senior vice president at Crocus Group, the real estate development company run by Azerbaijani-Russian oligarch Aras Agalarov, according to Kaveladze's LinkedIn. His personal website says he ""holds responsibility for multiple elements of the company's Russian development project.""
Trump Jr. attorney offers details about 8th person at meeting
He studied at the Moscow Academy of Finance and also got an MBA from the University of New Haven in Connecticut, according to his website. Kaveladze has worked for the Agalarovs' business since 2004, which means he was with the company when it partnered with the Trump Organization to pull off the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.
Balber said Kaveladze is a long-time US citizen who speaks fluent Russian and has ""never had any engagement with the Russian government in any capacity.""
Special Counsel investigators are seeking information from his client, Balber said. ""The eighth person has been identified by prosecutors and we are cooperating fully with prosecutors as a result of the investigation.""
Balber's comments offer a rare glimpse inside Mueller's investigation into allegations that Trump's campaign colluded with Russia.
Balber said his client hasn't been interviewed yet and that special counsel Robert Mueller's investigators have not reached out about Emin and Aras Agalarov, whom he also represents.
Emin Agalarov is an Azerbaijani-Russian pop star who has previously done business with the Trumps alongside his father, Aras Agalarov, a Russian real estate billionaire with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Kaveladze was asked to go to the meeting at Trump Tower last June with the understanding he would be Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya's translator because she didn't speak English, Balber said. He then realized at the meeting that she already had a translator that she had brought with her.
Balber said Kaveladze remembers discussions surrounding the Magnitsky Act -- a 2012 US law that imposed sanctions on Russian individuals -- and the retaliatory Kremlin-imposed ban on adoption of Russian children by American citizens.
The special counsel's office declined to comment.

China: Korean Peninsula Crisis Is Not Our Responsibility,"China welcomes South Korea’s grand proposal to solve the North Korea issue.
Since North Korea successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on July 4, the Korean Peninsula crisis has reached a tipping point. On July 6, newly elected South Korean President Moon Jae-in proposed his grand strategy of solving the crisis. In return, China welcomed his proposal and encouraged the international community’s support. On July 11, China emphasized that Korean Peninsula crisis is not China’s responsibility.
President Moon Jae-in made his important speech on North Korea in Berlin, Germany upon the invitation of the Körber Foundation. The grand strategy is the first detailed proposal made by Moon with specific suggestions. He argued that South Korea “must sit in the driver’s seat and lead Korean Peninsula-related issues” based on cooperation with its neighbor countries. His fundamental proposals could be summarized in two parts.
First, South Korea is only pursuing peace and will guarantee the security of the North Korean regime as long as North Korea completely dismantles its nuclear program. By emphasizing that “we do not wish for North Korea’s collapse, and will not work toward any kind of unification through absorption,” Moon urged North Korea to “come out to the forum of bilateral and multilateral dialogue on denuclearization.”

Second, Moon offered North Korea a bright economic future by including North Korea into “a new economic map on the Korean Peninsula.” Other than economic connections, Moon also requested that North Korea restart nonpolitical exchange and cooperation projects, such as allowing family reunions and private sector investment.
In terms of South Korea’s leading role, Moon said “Chinese President Xi Jinping and I also reached a consensus on this matter.”
In the regular press conference on July 10, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang immediately welcomed Moon’s initiation. Geng said, “China firmly support the two sides of the peninsula to improve the relations through dialogue and hopes the two sides could both express good will.” Also, Geng encouraged the international community’s understanding and support toward Moon’s “constructive effort.”
If Geng’s reply on July 10 was still quite reserved and cautious, his wording on the regular press conference on July 11 is absolutely strong and even aggressive.
He demanded that the “China responsibility theory” must stop:
As we said repeatedly, the crux of the Korean nuclear issue rests on the conflict between the DPRK and the U.S. and it is in essence a security issue. The Chinese side is neither the focal point of the conflict of the Korean nuclear issue nor the catalyzer for escalation of tensions at present, and it does not hold the key to solving the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue.
Then Geng sharply criticized “certain people” without naming a specific person or country:
In recent days, certain people have been exaggerating and playing up the so-called “China responsibility” theory. Those people have either failed to grasp the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue comprehensively and accurately, or done this out of ulterior motives with an attempt to shirk responsibility.
Geng accused those “certain people” of “kicking down the ladder” and “stabbing in other’s back”:
If when China is busy putting out a fire while someone pours fuel on it, when China is faithfully following through on Security Council’s resolutions while someone attempts to infringe upon China’s legitimate rights and interests, and when China is working vigorously to advance the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula while someone seeks excuse to endanger China’s security interests, then how can China’s efforts work out as expected? How can the situation be eased? And how can the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue be resolved?
Given that South Korea has offered to “sit in the driver’s seat” and play the leading role, it is undoubtedly a great relief for China, at least temporarily.

First Republican to propose Obamacare repeal bill now helps save it
Sen. Jerry Moran, who years ago was the first member of Congress to formally seek repeal of Obamacare, Monday became a major player in keeping the seven-year-old law alive, as least for now, as he said he’d oppose the Senate Republican effort to overhaul the system.
He was joined by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, pushing the number of GOP opponents to four. Since Republicans control 52 of the Senate’s 100 seats, the announcements doom the current version of the GOP plan.
“We should not put our stamp of approval on bad policy,” said Moran in a statement.
The senator, re-elected overwhelmingly to a second Senate term last year, has long been regarded as a Republican loyalist. And he reiterated Monday that his goal for health care “remains what it had been for a long time: To repeal and replace it.”
But Moran has been troubled by how fellow Republicans have gone about doing that. Monday, he criticized the “closed door process” that produced the version of the overhaul, and found the latest bill, unveiled last week, “fails to repeal the Affordable Care Act or address health care’s rising costs.”
Moran was one of about 10 Republican senators who had raised objections to an earlier version of the bill released last month. Two had already said they were opposed to the latest version, Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Rand Paul, R-Ky.
Last month, Moran’s concerns included worry about the bill’s deep cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state health care program that helps insure lower income consumers. The senator said the cuts could devastate rural hospitals in his home state of Kansas. He held a series of packed town halls on the subject in his state to solicit feedback from constituents, and even after this month’s bill was proposed, his concerns remained.
Among other objections Moran had raised about the earlier version of the bill were that it failed to address the systemic issues that drive up health care costs, did not provide enough premium and deductible relief, and Kansans are more likely to lose access to health care.
Moran also said he would need language or a program in the bill confirming rural hospitals will be better off.
“For the same reasons I could not support the previous version of this bill,” Moran said on Monday, “I cannot support this one.”
Moran warned Monday that if Republicans don’t come up with an alternative to Obamacare, supporters of a government-run health care system will triumph, costing taxpayers untold amounts of money. But it’s highly unlikely a “single payer” system would ever win congressional approval. While it has a strong following among some Democrats, other Democrats are wary.
Moran called for Congress to start over with a more bipartisan approach, a strategy that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had floated recently.
Moran wants an “open legislative process to develop innovative solutions that provide greater personal choice, protections for pre-existing conditions, increased access and lower overall costs for Kansas.”
David Jordan, director of the Alliance for a Healthy Kansas, which opposes the bill, praised Moran.
“We’re pleased the senator has chosen to protect the interest of Kansans vs. making decisions for political reasons,” Jordan said.
Sean Gatewood, co-administrator of the KanCare Advocates Network, who represents Kansans on Medicaid, also was pleased about Moran’s decision.
""His earlier concerns, none of them were addressed by this bill, so the fact that he stuck with it, we're really excited about it,"" Gatewood said of Moran’s opposition.

Obama’s Justice Department Gave ‘Special Visa’ To Russian Lawyer That Met With Donald Trump Jr,"The Russian lawyer at the center of the Trump-Russia ‘scandal’ was let into the United States by President Obama’s Department of Justice under ‘extraordinary circumstances.’ An explosive new report from The Hill claims that the Obama Justice Department enabled Moscow attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya to enter the United States even after being denied a Visa.
After entering the country Veselnitskaya engaged in a lobbying effort that not only got the attention of Donald Trump Jr., but also members of Congress, the State Department, and journalists:
“Just five days after meeting in June 2016 at Trump Tower with Donald Trump Jr., presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner and then Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Moscow attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya showed up in Washington in the front row of a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Russia policy, video footage of the hearing shows.
“She also engaged in a pro-Russia lobbying campaign and attended an event at the Newseum in Washington, D.C. where Russian supporters showed a movie that challenged the underpinnings of the U.S. human rights law known as the Magnitysky Act, which Russian leader Vladimir Putin has reviled and tried to reverse.”
And it only gets worse from there. Obama’s Attorney General Loretta Lynch personally took the extraordinary step of allowing Veselnitskaya to enter the country, even after being initially turned down:
“The Moscow lawyer had been turned down for a visa to enter the U.S. lawfully but then was granted special immigration parole by then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch for the limited purpose of helping a company owned by Russian businessman Denis Katsyv, her client, defend itself against a Justice Department asset forfeiture case in federal court in New York City.
“During a court hearing in early January 2016 as Veselnitskaya’s permission to stay in the country was about to expire, federal prosecutors described how rare the grant of parole immigration was as Veselnitskaya pleaded for more time to remain in the United States.”
As we now know, Veselnitskaya was not fully engaged in defending her client. She spent much of her time lobbying the federal government to repeal the Magnitsky Act which imposed sanctions on Russia over human rights abuses. And what AG Lynch did was extremely unusual and downright bizarre:
“In October the government bypassed the normal visa process and gave a type of extraordinary permission to enter the country called immigration parole,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Monteleoni explained to the judge during a hearing Jan. 6, 2016.
“That’s a discretionary act that the statute allows the Attorney General to do in extraordinary circumstances. In this case, we did that so that Mr. Katsyv could testify. And we made the further accommodation of allowing his Russian lawyer into the country to assist,” he added.
We still don’t know for sure why Loretta Lynch granted special immigration parole to Natalia Veselnitskaya. But given her track record of using the DOJ for political purposes, the speculation of corruption will only intensify from here. There are reports that the Obama Administration used the meeting between Veselnitskaya and Donald Trump Jr. as pretense to attain a FISA warrant that allowed wiretapping of Trump aides. This led to the unmasking of said officials which ultimately brought down National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.
So this scandal is going to get bigger, but maybe not in the way that left-wing outlets would like it to go. At the end of the day, the Obama Administration may be in more trouble than President Trump.

Subscribe to our Youtube Channel
People always question why the hell would these top journalists and political commentators throw their careers on the line for this man. Well, that’s because he’s paying these folks and we have receipts. According to NPR, Mark Serrano, a conservative political consultant was on the payroll of the Trump 2020 re-election campaign this spring, while also defending the president in political commentary on the Fox Business Network.
This all makes sense. Especially because who in their right mind would really defend Trump’s crooked ways and bad decisions? Someone who is getting paid big bucks to, that’s who. Trump’s 2020 campaign made two payments to Serrano’s company, ProActive Communications LLC: $20,000 on April 17 of this year and $10,000 on May 30. And that was at a time the top commentator was making frequent appearances on the Fox Business Network to back his buddy, Trump.
Just back in May, Serrano was defending Trump’s twitter habit while talking to Fox’s Neil Cavuto, saying,
“The president turns to Twitter for a very good reason. You know, it’s because he knows that the American people don’t believe this fake news story about Russian collusion.”
Well, Mark if that were true, how do explain the fact amid this Russia scandal, Trump’s had the lowest six-month approval rating of any president in polls dating back 70 years. ABCNews reported last month that 72 percent think Trump benefited from the collusion, and 67 percent think members of his campaign intentionally helped those efforts.
The Washington Post was the first to blow up Serrano’s spot. Then he got in his feelings, took a page from Trump and called the story fake news. He also released a statement via Twitter saying,
What I find unbelievable and troubling is that at a time with serious challenges facing our country, The Post wants to focus on this Fake News. Stories such as this make me more committed than ever to support the President and his ambitious positive agenda for America.
Even with the proof of the shady business relationship Serrano and Trump have, he still denies it. The Post even tried contacting Serrano by phone to get his statement on this matter, like a journalists do, but they never got a callback. So stop all your theatrics Serrano, you were caught red handed. This goes to show that you and other Fox News affiliates aren’t CREDIBLE. On top of that, it’s clear Trump’s foundation is crumbling as he has to resort to paying people to support him. Just pathetic.

But in addition to the many tweets correctly calling out the Trump administration for their irresponsible push for more coal production while simultaneously ignoring the importance of renewable energy, the Press Secretary faced significant backlash for the unprecedented move by the Trump administration to not allow cameras into the daily press briefings.

Trump Gave A Speech That Has The Wind Industry Terrified [VIDEO],"Wind industry officials scrambled to fend off President Donald’s criticism of wind turbines during his speech Wednesday night.
“I don’t want to just hope the wind blows to light up your homes and your factories,” Trump told supporters at a rally in Iowa. “As the birds fall to the ground.”
Trump’s comments triggered a response from the CEO of the country’s largest wind energy lobbying group, the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA). CEO Tom Kiernan published a series of tweets to push back against Trump’s critiques of wind power.
We were confused by some of the President’s remarks #TrumpSpeech about #windpower tonight? Here are some industry updates. (1 of 4)

As America’s #1 renewable energy by capacity, we appreciate the President’s inclusion of wind in his all of the above strategy. (4th of 4)
— Tom Kiernan (@TomCKiernan) June 22, 2017
Wind farms kill an estimated 573,000 birds and 888,000 bats each year, according to a 2013 peer-reviewed study published in Wildlife Society Bulletin. Wind farms are projected to kill 1.4 million birds annually by 2030 as more turbines come online. The industry has taken steps to mitigate bird deaths, and points out wind turbines are only responsible for a small fraction of them.
Trump used the speech to outline a vision for energy where the U.S. uses ever source possible.
“Whether it’s natural gas, whether it’s alternative sources, we’re going to have everything,” Trump said in the speech. “We use electric, we use wind, we use solar, we use coal, we use natural gas, we will use nuclear if the right opportunity presents itself. We’re going to be strong for the future.”
After winning the 2016 Presidential election last November, Trump allegedly told British politicians that he’s “personally offended” by wind turbines and thinks they’re unsightly.

Trump said transgender troops cause ‘disruption.’ These 18 militaries show otherwise.,"President Trump greets members of the military at Raleigh County Memorial Airport in Beaver, W.Va., on June 24. (Carolyn Kaster/AP)
Last year, the Pentagon lifted its long-standing ban on transgender men and women serving openly in the military. At the time, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter explained: “Our mission is to defend this country, and we don’t want barriers unrelated to a person’s qualification to serve preventing us from recruiting. … We have to have access to 100 percent of America’s population for our all-volunteer force to be able to recruit from among them the most highly qualified.”
That plan, studied extensively, was meant to be fully implemented by July 1.
This morning, President Trump reversed that policy.
After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow......
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017
....victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017
But would allowing transgender people to serve openly in the military create “disruption”?
There's no evidence that that's true.
Eighteen countries allow transgender personnel to serve openly in the military, including Australia, Israel, Britain, Sweden and Canada. None of these countries reported experiencing ill effects from opening up their armed services to the transgender community. “They all said the same thing, which is that inclusive policy has not in any way compromised military readiness. And that’s really important,” Palm Center director Aaron Belkin said at a conference last year. The Palm Center put out an extensive report on this issue in 2015.
In fact, the U.S. military studied how other countries tackled the change before drawing up its recommendations. A report by Rand Corp. which the Pentagon cited in its decision to lift the ban, looked closely at four countries: Israel, Britain, Canada and Australia. Researchers found that “while there is limited research on the effects of transgender personnel serving openly in foreign militaries, the available evidence indicated no significant effect on cohesion, operational effectiveness, or readiness.”
In fact, they said that when they talked to British officers, some “reported that increases in diversity had led to increases in readiness and performance. Interviews with these same commanders also found no effect on cohesion, though there were some reports of resistance to the policy change within the general military population, which led to a less-than-welcoming environment for transgender personnel.”
Of course, the specifics of integration look different depending on the country. In most places, transgender troops must undergo hormone therapy or surgery before they can serve. In Argentina, transgender service members aren't required to undergo surgery or receive an expert opinion before officially changing their gender.
The armed services in the Netherlands, Canada and Australia will pay for hormonal and surgical treatments, but only after the service member receives approval from a doctor.
In Britain, individuals must live as their target gender for two years before they are granted legal recognition. In Israel, where military service is mandatory, there are special programs to support transgender recruits.
Different countries offer different accommodations for service members who transition once they are already in the military. In Britain, they're offered a new uniform at the start of the transition process, along with new photos and ID cards bearing their new names. A guide produced by the Royal Australian Air Force (deemed the “gold standard” by experts) advises commanders to “use common sense.” When it comes to questions about housing and bathrooms, it suggests relatively intuitive solutions such as using shower curtains and ensuring individual stalls are available when necessary.
Transgender people are not barred from specific jobs in any of the services where they can serve openly, though they are often required to pass fitness tests for the gender they have transitioned to.",Washington Post – World,0

A former Woodburn police officer pleaded guilty to three counts of first-degree misconduct for repeatedly engaging in sexual relations while on duty.
Timothy Cobos, who has been working with Woodburn police since 2006, was sentenced to 18 months of bench probation and 40 hours of community service after pleading guilty to engaging in sexual activity while on duty with at least two women over the past two years.
Woodburn Chief of Police Jim Ferraris said Cobos' conduct does not reflect the department's ideals.
""This is a tragedy, it's sad for our department and sad for our community,"" Ferraris said. ""The key here is transparency and accountability. We believe in holding our people accountable for their actions.""
Ferraris said the investigation into Cobos' conduct was sparked by a citizen complaint. The investigation showed Cobos had repeatedly engaged in sexual activity while on duty, including in his patrol vehicle, with at least two women.
One of the women had Cobos use police equipment, including software called COPLINK, to access data on people and cases.
""I thought I'd seen it all, but I was wrong,"" Ferraris said while reading a statement on behalf of Woodburn Police to the court. ""He now meets the definition of a corrupt cop.""

Ferraris read a series of text messages Cobos sent to the women while he was under investigation by Woodburn Police. He repeatedly advised the women to be vague if questioned by investigators. At one point he said told the women to claim they were just ""friends from college"" if asked about their relationship.
""You can't be forced to talk,"" Cobos said in one text message.
Cobos said the investigation was a ""witch hunt"" based on a baseless complaint sent to his department, according to text messages.
Cobos' attorney, James McIntyre, said Cobos' conduct was born from years of being ""eroded"" by the years of witnessing traumatic events during his service as a police officer.
""That's what happened with Officer Cobos,"" McIntyre said. ""Those things can have long term emotional effects. That can cause people to give up the values they had in the first place.""
McIntyre said Cobos would not have engaged in the conduct ten years ago, but the job of being an officer damaged his life and ideals.
Marion County Deputy District Attorney Paige Clarkson, however, said Cobos' conduct was a breach of the community's trust.
""To see an anomaly like this is disappointing,"" Clarkson said. ""In no way is this representative of how police should work and how they do work in our community.""
Cobos voluntarily resigned from his position at Woodburn Police and decertified, which means he will not be allowed to be a police officer in the state of Oregon.
He will have until April 26, 2018 to complete the 40 hours of community service.

Self-Made Immigrant Billionaire Tells Every Trump-Hating Liberal Why They’ll Never Amount To Anything,"If you were born and raised in the good ole U.S. of A, your world has always been padded with democracy, free market, freedom of speech etc. We hear about battling for the preservation of our liberties, socialism, communism, dictatorships, and revolution, but our lives have been charmed enough to never experience any of that. Maybe that’s one reason that as a country, we’re as complacent about the seeds of change being planted by politicians; we have no real negative emotion to send us reeling from anything that threatens our freedom.
It stands to reason that since most of us know nothing of socialism, maybe we should listen to someone who does. Thomas Peterffy is a Hungarian-born American entrepreneur who was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1944, in a hospital basement during a Russian air raid. He emigrated to the United States as a refugee in 1965 and now has a net worth of about 13.8 billion dollars.
Here’s what he had to say back in 2012 about socialism and what’s happening in America today:
Peterffy says something very interesting “Yes the rich become poorer, but the poor also become poorer.” Inevitably, if someone objects to a socialist policy of some kind, our American privilege gets thrown back in our own faces as if it’s the absolute proof of selfishness. It’s as if you’re not allowed to have an opinion about the economy once you’re successful enough to have a car and a house. Now the people who are poorer than you have to get their piece of the pie.
Nobody wants the ultra rich to stack the deck in their favor, I get that. But it seems to me that if we let the unsuccessful in business decide how we’ll run the show, that would be kind of like letting the passengers fly the jet; sure they know where they want to go, but all those buttons and knobs are just going to overwhelm them and they’ll crash (and probably blame the pilot for it).","Yes, I’m Right",1

Five things to know about the U.S. refugee program.
Refugees and migrants are seen onboard the Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS) Phoenix vessel after being rescued at sea on June 10, 2017, off Lampedusa, Italy.(Photo: Chris McGrath, Getty Images)
The United States is set to reach a contentious milestone this week when it accepts its 50,000th refugee for the fiscal year, hitting a ceiling set by President Trump in his quest to sharply curtail immigration into the country.
The 50,000 figure is 41% lower than the 85,000 refugees accepted during President Barack Obama's final year in office, and would be the lowest total in a decade.
The White House said the reduction is necessary to give intelligence agencies time to review vetting procedures used to screen refugees to ensure terrorists don't infiltrate the U.S. posing as refugees. It is the same argument used to justify Trump's temporary travel ban targeting six mostly-Muslim nations.
""We are always looking for additional ways to enhance our screening, whether it be for visa applicants or if it’s for refugees,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.
Refugee groups counter that it is ""morally wrong"" for America to turn its back on those escaping war and other horrors when the world is facing its greatest migrant crisis. Hans Van de Weerd, chairman of the Refugee Council USA, which coordinates refugee arrivals in the U.S., said it's more important than ever for the U.S. to perform its historic role as a beacon for those fleeing persecution and violence.
""This administration has chosen yet again to target some of the most vulnerable populations in the world,"" he said.
The door for refugees will remain partly open, however, due to the June 26 ruling by the Supreme Court that allowed a portion of Trump's travel ban to take effect.
Federal judges blocked two versions of Trump's travel ban that placed a 90-day moratorium on travel from six majority-Muslim countries and a 120-day ban on the entire refugee program. The judges also prevented the administration from lowering the refugee cap to 50,000 from the 110,000 for the year ending Sept. 30 that Obama set before leaving office.
The Supreme Court allowed all of those restrictions to go into effect, but ordered the administration to continue accepting visa applicants and refugees who have a ""bona fide"" relationship to a U.S. person or entity.
The State Department defined a ""bona fide"" family relationship as a parent, spouse, fiancée, child, adult son or daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law or sibling. It will not consider grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law as being close enough to qualify.
It remains unclear how many refugees will qualify to enter the U.S. under those guidelines. State estimates that half of all refugees who arrive in the country have some relative already living in the U.S., but refugee organizations could not say how many of those relatives fall into the approved relationships.
The State Department also said that a refugee who has been working with a resettlement agency in the U.S. will not be considered a close enough relationship to qualify. That decision stunned and angered refugee advocates.
Betsy Fisher, policy director for the International Refugee Assistance Project, which helps place refugees in the U.S., pointed to examples given by the Supreme Court of relationships that would allow foreigners to enter the U.S. One of those examples was a foreign student accepted by a U.S. university.
The court ruled that those students have established a relationship with a U.S. entity, so Fisher doesn't understand why refugees would be treated any differently.
""(For a student) you have an offer letter from a university, and a clear, documented formal connection,"" Fisher said. ""For a refugee who is traveling, you have a clear and documented connection to a local community with housing and connections to provide services.""

2 Uber drivers charged with raping passengers in same city in a week
BRISBANE, Australia -- An Uber driver was charged on Friday with raping a 16-year-old passenger in the eastern Australian city of Brisbane, the second driver from the ride-hailing service to be charged with sexually assaulting a passenger in the city in a week.
Queensland state police said the 37-year-old man raped the teenager in his car on July 8, and the girl reported the assault to police the next morning. Police have released no other details, including the driver's name.
The arrest comes one week after another Uber driver was charged with raping a passenger three times. Police said the two cases are not related.
In a statement, Uber said it had immediately blocked the 37-year-old driver's access to the service after learning of the allegations against him.
Lyft president pushes for growth amid Uber's woes
While ride-hailing giant Uber battled chaos and controversy this year, competitor Lyft was making big gains. The company has added service to 150...
""The behavior described by Queensland Police is absolutely deplorable and our thoughts are with the woman and her family,"" the company said.
Despite the reported assaults, Police Acting Detective Superintendent Mick O'Dowd said officials are not concerned about Uber's safety record.
""I don't think from the actions of two persons you could draw a conclusion it makes Uber any less safe,"" he told reporters. ""There's thousands of transports every day where people are collected and dropped at their destination without any problem at all.""

Will America Have a ‘Lotus Flower’ Run for President in 2020?,"Written by Andrew Allen on July 17, 2017
 
In one sense I feel bad for Kamala Harris. Apparently she got called to visit the Clintons over the weekend. Poor Kamala, the things she must have endured – repeated unsolicited offerings of hot sauce, Hillary bobble-head performances at random intervals, Chelsea, Bill, more Chelsea. And that was before Ma Rodham hit the bottle and Kamala got to see her reprise election night 2016.
Did I mention Kamala’s name is a derivation of the Sanskrit word for “lotus flower”? Lotus Flower Harris is running for POTUS in 2020, and the Clinton’s want to help bankroll it. Or push Harris as a candidate so that Hillary can collude with the DNC and bump Lotus Flower to the VP spot on a Clinton-Kamala ticket. They’ll call it a co-presidency the way Bill and Hill did back in the 1990s except this time the boy with the cigar ain’t getting jiggy with the interns.
As a San Francisco lawyer it should come as no surprise Lotus Flower is into things leftards love. No need to itemize her disagreements with police, or her creation of “special LGBT hate crimes” investigation units, or all the rest here. Her colleague in the US Senate summed it up best:
Lotus flower, according to Dianne Feinstein, “just got here.” “Here” being the Senate and “just got” being a reference to Lotus Flower’s inexperience on the national stage. (To date, the only thing Lotus Flower has done nationally was play the role of victim during the James Comey hearings.)
Does that sound like someone we all remember?
In 2007, Barack Obama was an unknown quantity. All we knew was that, as Harry Reid said, he could do away with his “negro dialect” when he wanted. Oh, and Reid also said Obama was “clean”. Anyone call the Southern Poverty Law Center and ask them to look into Harry I-Got-My-Ass-Kicked-By-Bow-Flex Reid’s racism?
Lotus Flower’s history isn’t as opaque as Obama’s. But aside from the Comey hearing, the bulk of her curricula vitae is ensconced in San Francisco and California politics. That means she’s still something of an unknown in a Democratic field populated by potential candidates that are all older than dirt and more out of touch than an elderly white woman going on an urban radio program to pitch hot sauce.
Being of both Indian – as in curry, the subcontinent, and Mumbai variety and not the Elizabeth Warren kind – and Jamaican heritage, Lotus Flower’s ethnic background is all the left needs to overlook the things Lotus Flower needs them to overlook. Kind of like how Obama attended twenty years of sermons by a radical America-hating weirdo, but the left was cool with it because, hey, Barack Obama was black.
Lotus Flower is both ethnically not white AND she’s self-identified as a woman. That’s a doubleheader for the left.
Unless Bernie Sanders decides he self-identifies as a woman. Then things could get really weird – and that’s saying something in this day and age.

"Trump Jr., Manafort, Kushner To Testify Before Senate","Donald Trump Jr. and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 26, Reuters is reporting.
Jared Kushner, senior advisor to President Donald Trump, will also testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee in a closed session on July 24.
Trump Jr. has been criticized for taking a meeting with a Russian lawyer, with the promise of receiving damaging information on Hillary Clinton.
On June 9, 2016, a meeting was held in Trump Tower in New York City between three senior members of the presidential campaign of Donald Trump – Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort – and at least five other people, including Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. The meeting was arranged by publicist Rob Goldstone on behalf of Emin Agalarov; The Trumps knew both Goldstone and the Agalarovs from the Miss Universe 2013 pageant in Moscow.
The meeting was disclosed to U.S. government officials when Jared Kushner filed a revised version of his security clearance form. Unlike Kushner, Trump Jr. and Manafort were not required to disclose foreign contacts because as they did not subsequently serve in the Trump administration they did not require security clearance.

Trump Gets Hit With Major Multimillion Dollar Class Action Lawsuit (DETAILS),"Stephanie Deleon-July 5, 2017
Much has happened since November of 2016 when Donald Trump settled a multimillion dollar case against him and his real estate program, Trump University. Just days after being inaugurated, Donald settled three class action lawsuits totaling $25 million dollars. Trump and his business partners scammed more that 6,000 people out of millions of dollars for years.
The scam tricked students into believing they were learning Donald Trump’s real estate secrets. The students were told they were being taught by professors who were “hand picked” by Trump, who claimed they had years of success in the field. In actuality, the classes were being taught by people who had no formal training of any kind and no real estate experience.
Sherri Simpson was one of Trump University’s students who was cheated out of thousands of dollars. Now, she’s taking Trump back to court. Simpson believes that she was denied the right to opt out of the settlement. She, and the others involved in the lawsuit, would only receive about one-seventh of the value of their claims under that settlement. There would also be no public trial, no admission of Trump’s wrongdoing, and no court order to prevent a repeat of the same situation. Simpson said that:
‘I understand why some folks simply want to settle, take a little money, and forget this ever happened. Scams like Trump U victimize the vulnerable, and they need to be stopped. This shouldn’t be swept under the rug with a settlement that doesn’t even require him to pay back what he took or admit guilt.’
Simpson is planning on suing Trump independently for fraud, which she hopes would force Trump to produce evidence. The former student has hired some of Washington’s most prestigious lawyers, Gary B. Friedman and Deepak Gupta. The first step, according to Friedman is to challenge the settlement:
‘We’re asking them to rule that there is no authority to approve a settlement in this case, because it did not allow the class members to opt out – to say yes or no to the settlement.’
Deepak Gupta has argued cases before the Supreme Court and also worked as a litigator for the former Deepak Gupta has argued cases before the Supreme Court and also worked as a litigator for the former Deepak Gupta has argued cases before the Supreme Court and also worked as a litigator for the former Deepak Gupta has argued cases before the Supreme Court and also worked as a litigator for the former administration. Gupta believes that Simpson has a case, and said:
‘Trump really could end up going to trial. We’re confident that the Ninth Circuit will rule that any deal like this must allow people like Sherri to opt out if they want.’
A date for the trial has not yet been set.

UK Ministry of Justice to Review Compensation Denials for Child Victims of Sexual Abuse,"* The UK Ministry of Justice is reviewing a series of child sexual abuse cases amidst criticism that the victims were wrongfully denied compensation because they were deemed to have consented to the abuse, the Telegraph first reported.
* A coalition of five UK charities has asked the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) to review its compensation guidelines after a freedom of information request discovered that 693 child sexual abuse victims had been denied compensation for the abuse they experienced.
* The five UK charities that issued the request are Barnardo’s, Victim Support, Liberty, Rape Crisis, and the National Working Group.
* On 18 July, Barnardo’s released a press statement saying the five charities had written to the UK Justice Secretary, David Lidington, to review the CICA guidelines. The CICA guidelines offer requirements victims have to fulfill before being awarded compensation.
* The coalition of charities claims that CICA denied 693 cases on the basis that the children in these cases were not “direct victims of a crime of violence.”
* According to Barnado’s, “the authorities do not state how many of these were denied because they ‘consented’ to their sexual relationship, but state that they were denied based on the fact that the child was ‘not a direct victim of a crime of violence.’”
* CICA considers a sexual crime to be a “crime of violence” when it involves “a sexual assault to which a person did not in fact consent.”
* The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) is an executive agency which deals with “compensation claims from people who have been physically or mentally injured because they were the blameless victim of a violent crime in England, Scotland or Wales.”
* In the UK, executive agencies are agencies connected to a ministry, but have a certain level of autonomy and are kept at “arms-length.”
* According to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, in England, “there were 37,778 recorded sexual offenses against under 16 year olds in 2015/16. This is a rate of 36.3 sexual offenses per 10,000 children aged under 16 a 23% increase on the previous year.” In Wales, “there were 2,329 recorded sexual offenses against under 16 year olds in 2015/16. This is a rate of 41.9 sexual offenses per 10,000 children aged under 16 a 25% increase on the previous year.”
* It is not clear whether these increases are because victims have reported abuse at higher rates than in the past, whether the frequency of abuse has risen, or both.

“It’s not only bizarre but also inappropriate and harmful that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority applies a different definition of consent from the law and, as a result, routinely tell victims and survivors of child sexual abuse and exploitation that they consented to the sexual violence perpetrated against them. “
“It is ridiculous, nonsensical and morally wrong to pretend that a child has consented to sexual abuse and to then use this as an excuse not to pay compensation. Any child that suffers sexual abuse is a victim – full stop.”
“No child can consent to abuse, which is why the criminal law rightly says they are simply unable to do so…
For a state agency to tell children who have survived these horrific crimes that they did consent – and deny them compensation – is a disgrace. The Government must urgently change these guidelines.”

“Child sexual abuse is abhorrent, and victims can apply for taxpayer-funded compensation awards through the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme…
Our guidelines are intended to make sure that controlling and abusive behavior is taken into account when handling compensation applications… We are urgently reviewing our guidelines to ensure they are robust enough to deal with cases where grooming may be a factor.”
“We will look closely at the concerns raised by these charities that some victims are not getting the compensation they deserve… The issue of compensation for victims is currently being examined by the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, and the Ministry of Justice is contributing to its important work.”

Former Obama admin official admits they ‘sort of choked’ at this foreign threat,"Carlos Garcia 4 hours

A former senior Obama official reportedly told the Washington Post that the previous administration did know that Russia was meddling in the election, but they “sort of choked” in response. The Post published the report Friday.
“It is the hardest thing about my entire time in government to defend,” the official said. “I feel like we sort of choked.”
The report says that the Obama administration knew that Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin himself had ordered the alleged cyberattacks in order to trip up Democrat Hillary Clinton and aid Republican Donald Trump.
CIA Director John Brennan first notified the president, and their assessment was verified by the other intelligence agencies in the subsequent weeks.
The Post says former President Obama considered many different retaliatory measures against Putin, even to the point of releasing damaging information gathered by the CIA to embarrass Putin, and imposing sanctions to derail the Russian economy.
But in the end, he ordered very modest measures against the Russian Federation.
In December the government shut down known Russian spy compounds on American soil and imposed light sanctions targeted against specific Russian government officials and operatives. The Post reported in May that the Trump administration was considering returning the compounds to the Russian government.
Obama had also told the press in December that he had personally told Putin to “cut it out” on the meddling in the election.
“What I was concerned about in particular was making sure [the DNC hack] wasn’t compounded by potential hacking that could hamper vote counting, affect the actual election process itself,” the president said at a press conference. “So in early September when I saw president Putin in China, I felt that the most effective way to ensure that that didn’t happen was to talk to him directly and tell him to cut it out and there were going to be serious consequences if he didn’t. And in fact we did not see further tampering of the election process.”
Obama’s former deputy national security adviser, Tony Blinken, acknowledged that warning from Obama to Putin, saying that they believed they deterred him from further meddling, but that the “damage was done.”
“We made massive efforts so they couldn’t do that,” Blinken said to CNN’s Kate Bolduan. “This led to two things: President Obama issued a very stark warning to President Putin in September at the G-20 conference in China. What we saw, or thought we saw, after that, it looked like the Russians stopped their efforts. But the damage was already done.”",TheBlaze,1
ALERT: Trump Outs Secret CIA Mission To Entire World. Should He Resign?,"Donald Trump just publicly outed a covert Obama-era CIA program in Syria—a program that up until now has only been rumored to exist. How many times is Trump going to have to betray America’s national security interests before Trump voters realize he is an AWFUL Commander-in-Chief?
Let’s bring you up to speed on the context of this outrageous story. Last week, The Washington Post published a bombshell sourced from anonymous U.S. officials that detailed how Trump was moving to end a covert Obama program to arm moderate Syrian rebels in their ongoing war with tyrant Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
This story was a MAJOR revelation in and of itself, since it marked an inappropriate and unwise concession from Trump to Vladimir Putin in Syria. One of Putin’s central foreign policy goals has been to get America out of Syria altogether, so ending this CIA program would be Trump’s biggest gift to Putin yet.
But the thing is, WaPo was simply reporting what their inside sources were telling them. The story had not been independently confirmed yet because presidential administrations aren’t usually in the business of confirming or denying the existence of covert CIA programs.
That ALL changed, though, when Trump took to Twitter to bash The Post’s story, outrageously outing the existence of this top secret CIA operation in the process. Trump, who’s repeatedly attacked government leakers, is LITERALLY a leaker himself.
“The Amazon Washington Post fabricated the facts on my ending massive, dangerous, and wasteful payments to Syrian rebels fighting Assad,” Trump tweeted out. “So many stories about me in the @washingtonpost are Fake News. They are as bad as ratings challenged @CNN. Lobbyist for Amazon and taxes?”
So, there you have it—Trump just exposed the existence of the CIA’s “payments to Syrian rebels fighting Assad.” This pattern of publicly betraying America’s national security interests is CLEARLY becoming a pattern for Trump.

Recall how just weeks ago Trump gave up the secret location of two U.S. submarines in the Korean peninsula. Or how Trump betrayed the location, identity, and nationality of a Western spy in ISIS-held Syria during an Oval Office meeting with Russia’s Foreign Minister.
Seriously, Trump is the most pathetic Commander-in-Chief the American people have EVER seen. Betraying top secret CIA programs is NOT the behavior of a competent man.
But this nightmare is playing right into Vladimir Putin’s hands. He must be ecstatic that Trump is undermining America so consistently.

Firefighter Accused of Shooting Neighbor During an Altercation WILL NOT be charged.,"Breaking NewsDisturbingNews and Politics
 
Steve Boss6 hours ago
As RTV – Channel Six Reports:
This newly released video shows a shootout between an Indy firefighter and his Johnson County neighbor. The firefighter will not face charges because the prosecutors say he acted in self-defense, using this video as evidence.
JOHNSON COUNTY, Ind. — An Indianapolis firefighter accused of shooting his neighbor during an altercation in Johnson County last month will not be charged.
Dean Keller, 49, was accused of shooting his neighbor, Jeffery Weigle, 59, four times in the chest, sending him to the hospital in critical condition.
In a release sent out Wednesday, the Johnson County Prosecutor’s Office said Keller had acted in self-defense and would not be charged in the shooting.

* Congressman Responds to North Korea – Kim Jong Un is Absolutely TERRIFIED After Just These 3 Words…
Weigle may face charges “if and when he recovers,” according to the release.
Keller’s sister, Leah Shipe, blamed the shooting on an ongoing fence dispute, saying Weigle had been “badgering” her brother for years.
The video, released by the prosecutor’s office on Wednesday, shows Weigle addressing Keller by saying, “Hey a**hole,” before adjusting a portion of the fence that borders their property. He then says “I see you got the s*** out,” in reference to Keller’s wife. Weigle then gets onto his riding lawnmower and starts to ride off.
As Keller approaches the fence to see what Weigle did, Weigle backs up his lawnmower and flashes a gun at Keller. Keller pulls out his own gun and fires at Weigle, hitting him four times in the chest during an exchange of multiple shots.
The video was used as evidence in determining that Keller would not be charged.

Barbara Streisand Blasts Trump And Gets The Worst Wakeup Call Of Her Life,"Alice Ali 11 hours agoNews41 Views
On Friday, Hollywood liberal Barbra Streisand penned an op-ed for the Huffington Post, ranting against President Donald Trump and calling him an “angry, hollow, vindictive man.”
The article, titled “The Fake President,” claimed that there is “a narcissistic fraud in the White House. In the following paragraphs, the Academy Award winner questions Trump’s mental health and his willingness to criticize the “very fake news media.”
“The large ego of a small man drives the vindictiveness of his policies,” Streisand wrote. Later, she argued that Trump “will not grow in the office.”
“He watches cable TV and then tweets in a rage,” the singer said. “He lacks the temperament to fulfill his role. For all his ranting about fake news and fake media…the truth is, he is the fake president.”
Though wholly inappropriate, Streisand’s comments are not entirely unexpected. Like he fellow Hollywood liberals, she is yet to go anywhere and the rest of are forced to listen to her whine.
What do you think of Streisand’s article?

Behind the ‘Scapegoating’ of Russia,"The media/political hysteria over Russia-gate is leading the world to possible nuclear annihilation with few serious questions asked. But a new book, The Plot to Scapegoat Russia, tries to supply some context, writes Rick Sterling.
Attorney Dan Kovalik has written an extremely important book that challenges the current media/political focus on “Russia-gate” and warns that dark forces of war are taking us in an ever more dangerous direction.
President Barack Obama (third from left) and Russian President Vladimir V. Putin (second from right), share a toast at a luncheon hosted by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon at the General Assembly.
In the foreword to the book, The Plot to Scapegoat Russia: How the CIA and Deep State Have Conspired to Vilify Russia, author David Talbot writes: “The US war machine has revived the tried-and-true Red Scare…. This massive anti-Russian propaganda campaign is one of the biggest fake news operations in U.S. history….
“Unlike our war-obsessed media, human rights lawyer Dan Kovalik does understand that peace and diplomacy are in the best interests of the American and Russian peoples. His book is an urgently needed counterassault against the propaganda forces that are trying to push us over a precipice that it too terrifying to even contemplate. It’s time for all of us to speak truth to power before it’s too late.”
Talbot’s warning is not hyperbole. As I write this review, the U.S. military is pushing ever closer to direct military confrontation with Syria, Iran and Russia inside Syria.
But the book is also entertaining reading because Kovalik combines his personal evolution with facts and history. He grew up as a conservative Roman Catholic fearful and wary of communism and the Soviet Union. Kovalik describes his own youthful belief in “American Exceptionalism” whereby U.S. policies and actions are believed to be uniquely good and well meaning. For the author, that belief was confronted by a very different reality when he traveled to Central America in the 1980s. There he saw the reality of U.S.-funded “Contras” terrorizing Nicaraguan villagers. There he learned of the four Catholic nuns murdered by the Salvadoran military, which the U.S. government was supporting.
The first-hand experience led to more reading and research which resulted in the shocking realization that the U.S. government has been behind coups and military dictatorships from Indonesia to Iran, Guatemala, El Salvador, Brazil, Paraguay, Chile and more.
The author discusses U.S. foreign policy since World War Two, before and after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He puts the current “new” Cold War in historical context and reviews the facts behind the current media/political focus on “Russia-gate.” He concludes that we are being blinded with baseless Russo-phobia while forces pushing for more American war and aggression are going unchallenged and recklessly threatening a war that could engulf us all.
Relevant but not widely known historical facts are reviewed:
–the role of American advisers in the collapse of the Russian economy during the 1990s.
–the broken promises to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev about restraining the growth of NATO.
–the expansion of NATO right up to the Russian border.
–the NATO wars on Yugoslavia, Iraq, Libya.
–the increasing discrepancy between rich and poor both within the U.S. and internationally
The author presents the case that the real threat to democracy is not coming from Russia, it is coming from our own political system and the forces which benefit from and which promote war and aggression. Former President Jimmy Carter has said the U.S. is an “oligarchy with unlimited political bribery.”
Kovalik also reviews the history of whistleblowers at the CIA and other intelligence agencies and concludes that “The CIA is not a reliable source and poses a much greater threat to US democracy than Russia ever could.” He cites the long history of conflict between the CIA and presidents seeking to promote peace. President John Kennedy had such fierce conflict with the CIA that he said he wanted to “break it into a thousand pieces and scatter to the wind.” Now, the CIA wants President Trump to stay on the path of confrontation with Russia, Kovalik explains.
Kovalik presents a persuasive case that the demonization of Russia and President Vladimir Putin is being used to justify war and, thus, an ever-increasing military budget. Instead of a “peace dividend,” the post-Cold War period led to ever-greater U.S. intervention abroad. Now, the New Cold War is raising the risk of a direct confrontation and possible nuclear war even though most Americans do not want another war.
So, why are we headed down that slippery slope? This book goes a long way to explaining why.

The thing is Trump has actually been on several Time magazine covers, so there was really no need to create a fake one – unless they simply didn’t convey him in the way he wanted to be conveyed.
As Morning Joe reports, Time has asked Trump to remove the fake cover. I’m guessing he’ll do that to avoid another ‘scandal’ in the MSM.

"When Trump Met With The Indian PM, No One Thought They’d End Up Doing This","President Trump showed his mastery in foreign relations and diplomacy today when he met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The two world leaders met for a working dinner and then gave a joint press conference in the Rose Garden.
No one could deny the two got along well just from this epic hug:
President Trump had the difficult task of being friendly with India, but also accommodating American interests by getting India to lower its trade barriers to American exports. President Trump was clear:
“It is important that barriers be removed to the export of U.S. goods into your markets and that we reduce our trade deficit with your country.”
Last year the U.S. had a more than $30 billion trade deficit with India.
Despite the potential conflict between the two countries’ desire to increase their own domestic manufacturing, PM Modi seemed excited for revitalized relations with the U.S., saying:
“I am sure that the convergence of my vision for “New India” and President Trump’s vision for making America great again will add new dimensions to our cooperation.”
The Trump Administration has also made new deals with India, including the approval of $2 billion in naval drones from an American defense contractor, and on-going negotiations to sell American gas.
Over all the meeting was very positive, and although there will always be a possibility for disagreement, it is great to see the two leaders get along so well. As one Indian official said:
“If the chemistry is good, everything else gets sorted. The only way is up. How much up we go depends on the leaders. If they click, we go up higher.”
That’s what we like to hear! The media is never going to emphasize the positive sides of this meeting and how both leaders and working towards growing both countries- together! That’s why we need to share this 1 million times to show President Trump is making the U.S. friends and strengthening key allies around the world!",Liberty Writers,1
BREAKING: Ted Cruz Drops CNN Criminal Bombshell. Libs Are Panicking.,"admin News, Politics, U.SLeave a comment
CNN is the talk of the town, and it is easy to see why with all of their foolish propaganda. Now, Ted Cruz has a message that CNN should probably take into consideration if they want to remain on the air.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), is one of the most influential people in our country, and after reading what he has to say about CNN, it is easy to see why. In a Twitter bomb about the way CNN threatened to blackmail the citizen who made the GIF of Trump wrestling with the CNN logo, Cruz points out “It’s a GA crime if they threatened to ‘disseminate any information tending to subject any person to hatred, contempt, or ridicule…”
Cruz has a strong history of doing the right thing and following the laws precisely how they are meant to be interpreted. American Thinker mentions how Cruz quite literally helped save our Second Amendment rights. He wants what is best for the country based on the law of the land.
What CNN is doing here is blackmail, pure and straightforward. It is not acceptable behavior from ANYONE, let alone one of the top liberal news networks in the country. We can’t be too surprised considering the state of mind Democrats find themselves lately.
It doesn’t matter how upset they are about a little GIF; they have NO RIGHT to put this American citizen in danger of retaliation because his 20 second GIF hurt their feelings. The media and EVERYONE on the Left need to grow some thicker skin.
How cowardly is it that they got on the air and whined that the GIF promoted violence against the media? These are the same people who have no problem airing footage of individuals talking about assassinating President Trump. The hypocrisy is enough to make your head explode.
Are we really at a point in our history where the media is going around whining like adolescents because someone made a joke about them? It is unreal, it feels like a big practical joke — but sadly this is our reality.
Cruz is here to lay the smackdown, and you better believe if CNN presses the button and releases information on this average citizen there is going to be a price to pay. They are going to have to face up to their hideous acts and face the consequences.
It won’t be long before CNN shoots themselves in the foot again. When it happens, we will be here to let you know what they are doing. If they keep THIS nonsense up, they may not make the end of the year!",Nevo News,1

Up to 76 people were rescued from cable cars suspended over the river Rhine in Cologne on Sunday afternoon after a gondola crashed into a support pillar, leaving passengers stranded.
German fire crews lowered people to safety from cable cars in a dramatic recovery operation, with children seen clinging to parents as they dangled 40 metres above the river.
German media reported that rescue teams in Cologne had practised for an incident on the gondola just a week ago.
A pregnant woman and a man were slightly injured in the rescue mission in which mobile cranes were used to bring the stranded passengers to safety. No other injuries were reported.
Public transportation authorities for the city in North-Rhine-Westphalia state said 32 gondolas were operating when the incident occurred. An official cause has not been announced, but there was strong wind at the time.
Martina and Hans-Peter Rieger, the first to be rescued, were celebrating their 41st wedding anniversary on a day out in Cologne when the cable cars stopped. “That will always be in our memory,” Mr Rieger said. “Fortunately, we were given hand signals to tell us we should remain calm and the incident was nothing bad.”
Emergency services from Aachen and Dusseldorf assisted fire crews with the rescue.

Henriette Reker, the mayor of Cologne, said: “I would like to thank the Cologne fire brigade for their great dedication. This meant that the passengers could be rescued quickly. My thoughts were with the children and adults, who had to wait courageously and patiently for many hours.“
The cable cars in Cologne are a popular means of transport, connecting the zoo to the Rheinpark across the river. The system remained close on Sunday evening as officials worked to establish the cause.",The Guardian – World,0

Here’s Who Will Lament — and Celebrate — the Plummeting U.S. Birth Rate,"The birth rate among women in the United States just hit a historic low, leading some demographers to worry that population decline may lie in our future.
New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveal that in 2016, there were just 62 live births per 1,000 women of childbearing age. That’s a one percent decrease from 2015, and the lowest rate on record. Blame the millennials, say demographers — they’re not having kids. Some commentators have worried this may become a “national emergency” if the rate were to drop below population replacement levels.
What’s so bad about fewer babies? That depends on who you ask — and, often, their political leanings.
A population that fails to replace itself means a growing elderly population sustained by a shrinking workforce, creating social anxiety, economic troubles, and a general sense of cultural malaise.
William Frey, a population expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington, suspects that a still-recovering U.S. economy is to blame for the dip, rather than more permanent factors. “Every year I say when the economy is getting better then we’ll start having more children,” Frey told the Washington Post, “and I’m still expecting that to happen.”
Solutions to population woes are where partisan views begin to diverge. Conservatives are more likely to emphasize religious and traditional values as the best way to encourage families to have more children.
A May 2015 article in Breitbart, the alt-right news site, called falling fertility rates among millennial women “disturbing.” It connected lower birth rates to abortion, noting that 5.6 million pregnancies had been terminated between 2007 and 2011 — a common view in the pro-life movement but less widely accepted outside of it.
In some European countries, many of which have lower fertility rates than the United States, governments have launched public initiatives, such as Denmark’s “Do it for mom” campaign in 2015, which encouraged couples to have kids to please their parents.
Another way to ensure population replacement is through robust immigration. But that is another point where partisan concerns about fertility diverge — and where some of the real civilizational angst can set in.
Japan presents an extreme case. The nation’s population is already in net decline, with whole villages aging away. There’s one village where elderly residents make life-size dolls and place them in classrooms and playgrounds to remind them of what children are like, since there are no more children there anymore.
As the working population in Japan shrinks, there won’t be enough nurses to take care of the people who will soon be filling up nursing homes. Taiwan and Hong Kong also have some of the lowest fertility rates in the world, but they’ve implemented visa programs that allow foreign workers.
But Japan has kept its immigration laws watertight, preferring instead to pour billions of dollars into creating service robots for the country’s burgeoning nursing home industry. The Japanese government would literally rather have robots take care of its aging population than open the country to non-Japanese workers.
Tinges of a similar ethnocentrism can be found, with increasing fervor in the past few years, in more distant corners of the American and European right. Concerns about declining birth rates, rising immigration from non-Western countries, and the fall of the Judeo-Christian West resonate on both sides of the Atlantic.
Britain’s former chief rabbi, Lord Jonathan Sacks, has warned that the secularization of Europe was leading to its demographic, moral, and ultimately civilizational downfall. Sacks claimed in an interview with the Daily Telegraph in 2016 that there was no “historical example of a society that became secularised and maintained its birth rate over subsequent centuries.”
“That’s how great civilizations decline and fall,” he said.
These fears help explain why Trump’s base can support policies that would reduce overall immigration while simultaneously fearing a shrinking population. In May 2016 White House chief strategist and former Breitbart chief Stephen Bannon invited Italian conservative Benjamin Harnwell to his radio show to share a similar message.
“There’s not a single country, a single EU member state, that has a fertility rate at replacement level,” Harnwell claimed. Yet Muslim immigration threatened the continent as well, he said, since Europeans, who have lost touch with their Christian values, were unable to see the “innately aggressive” aspects of Islam.
News of the low birth rate is likely to delight at least one U.S. group — the small Virginia-based nonprofit Negative Population Growth. The group believes that endless population growth will destroy the environment and strain resources; it supports policies to lower the birthrate and reduce immigration to “traditional levels.”
Theirs isn’t a view that is currently widely held in the United States, but it harks back to fears of a “population bomb” that gripped the Western world in the 1970s, when the group was founded. In 1969, Paul Ehrlich, a popular public intellectual and biologist who frequently appeared on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, declared at a conference, “Our first move must be to convince all those we can that the planet Earth must be viewed as a spaceship of limited carrying capacity.” The United Nations declared 1974 “Population Year,” and more than a hundred countries gathered to discuss global population control measures. China’s draconian one-child policy was borne in part from this strain of thought.
“We must not simply stop population growth,” Negative Population Growth proclaims on its website. “We must turn it around.”",Foreign Policy,0

Tucker Carlson DESTROYS Ralph Peters after he Compares Tucker to Hitler Apologist (VIDEO),"HAHAHAHAHA - TUCKER CARLSON Just Went Off on Guest Who Compared Him To ADOLPH HITLER (VIDEO)
Tucker Carlson recently had Ralph Peters on his show, to talk about the reports which suggested that the ISIS leader had been killed in an air strike.
It didn’t take long however, before the discussion turned to Russia and Trump. This then led to a rather heated back and forth between Tucker and Peters, which ultimately ended with Peters comparing Tucker to a Nazi apologist.
Tucker Carlson: He’s a shady guy… Hard to see why he’s a threat to us. How many wars can we fight at once? Why not just accept that people who are bad people share our interests and side with them?
Ralph Peters: You sound like Charles Lindbergh in 1938 saying Hitler hasn’t attacked us.
Tucker Carlson: I beg your pardon. Slow down for a minute. I am not in any way, you cannot compare me to someone who would make apologies for Hitler? And I don’t think Putin is comparable to Hitler.
Ralph Peters: I think Putin is.
Tucker Carlson: I think that is a grotesque overstatement. It’s insane!
Ralph Peters: You can think it’s insane all you want.
Tucker Carlson: You just compared me to a Nazi apologist because I asked a simple question…

"7 Summer Safety Tips That Could Save Your Dog’s Life, I Can’t Believe I Never Knew This!","NPO Animals7 days ago
As summer temperatures continue to rise, dog owners must pay even closer attention to their pet’s needs. If you want to keep your pet safe and alive, it’s essential to learn these summer safety tips for dogs. No dog deserves to experience this kind of pain!
Many dogs enjoy experiencing all that summer has to offer — but soaking up all that sun can be dangerous.
There’s nothing wrong with taking your pet out for picnics, hikes, swimming, or running — but owners must remember that dogs have a harder time keeping cool than humans.
Before you take another summertime outdoor adventure with your dog, take a look at the information below. Be sure to SHARE it with your family and friends, you could save a life!
Here are 7 Summer Safety Tips for Dogs:
1. It’s never, ever, EVER okay to leave your dog in a hot car
This tip may seem obvious, but it’s such a common mistake that we still decided to list it first. It only takes a few minutes — yes, MINUTES — for a pet to develop heat stroke and suffocate in a car. You’d be surprised how many people underestimate how hot it gets in parked cars.
According to Pet Health Network, on a 78-degree day, temperatures in a car can reach 90 degrees if parked in the shade and higher than 160 degrees if parked directly in the sun! No pet deserves to experience that kind of heat!
Experts suggest leaving your dog at home on warm days. Even if you’re just cruising around with your dog in the car, it’s best to bring water and a dish for him to drink from. When you leave the car, always take your dog with you.
2. Make sure your dog is protected from parasites like fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes
The Centers for Disease Control recently issued a warning about the rise of tick-borne diseases — and dogs are especially at risk. It is very difficult to completely avoid exposure to parasites, but the best way to protect your dog is with regular use of tick control products. Your veterinarian can advise you about the best product for your dog and your situation.
The CDC also suggests performing regular body checks — both on your dogs and the humans who spend a lot of time around them. The places where ticks attach can become red and irritated.
If not protected, your pet is at risk for Lyme disease, heartworm, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and several other life-threatening conditions that can be caught by people too! In some cases, ticks can consume enough of your dog’s blood to cause a deficiency called anemia.
3. Keep your dog’s paws cool
When the sun is beating down relentlessly, surfaces like asphalt or metal can get extremely hot! Although daily walks are just as important in the summertime, try to keep the trips short, especially when it is hot. This will ensure that your dog doesn’t get overheated and avoids painful burns to his paw pads.
Veterinarians suggest keeping your pet off hot surfaces, particularly hot asphalt and hot metal. In addition to causing pain to tender paws, hot asphalt can also increase body temperature and lead to overheating. The hot metal in the bed of a truck burns paws quickly too.
Paw pad burns are visible to the naked eye. Signs of paw pad burns include discomfort, holding up a foot, limping, or vocalizing when walking. In severe cases, a black paw pad can turn red when it is burned or if the paw pad is actually separating from the paw.
This is why veterinarian advise dog owners to keep walks to a minimum during summertime. If you want to walk your dog during summertime, you can avoid paw pad burns by walking on non-concrete surfaces.
4. Your dog should always have access to fresh drinking water and shade
Keeping your dog hydrated could be the difference between life and death. Dogs get even thirstier than humans do when they get hot. Unlike humans who have a variety of ways to drink water and cool down though, dogs really don’t have a way to cool themselves down other than panting and drinking — or jumping in — whatever water is within reach. It’s important to keep your pet in the shade as much as possible and provide him with easy access to fresh drinking water.
5. Give your dog his very own “kiddy pool”
Putting out a small, kid-sized pool is a great option for keeping dogs cool during the summer heat. Dogs love getting wet, and watching them cool down this way is great entertainment too!
6. Don’t assume your dog can swim well
Although dogs instinctively know how to swim, it doesn’t mean they’re good swimmers. That’s why it’s important to make sure your dog can’t get into your swimming pool or bodies of water without you around. No matter how much a dog loves swimming, he might not be able to get out without help and could easily drown.
7. Dogs get sunburns too!
Believe it or not, dogs can sunburn just like humans, especially those with short or light-colored coats. And all know how painful sunburns can be! Dogs can develop skin cancer from overexposure to the sun too. Talk to your veterinarian about sunscreens for your dog — do not assume a sunscreen for humans is safe for your dog.
If you have any questions or concerns about your pets in warm summer weather, always make sure you talk with your veterinarian. Be sure to SHARE all of these important facts and summer safety tips for dogs with your loved ones! You could save a life.

Ossoff’s Loss Cost Rich California Libs A DISGUSTING Amount In Failed Campaign Donations,"Posted by Allan Stein
Despite an unprecedented outpouring of campaign dollars from the Golden State, even money couldn't buy libdem Jon Ossoff a ticket to ride on that midnight train into the Georgia House of Representatives.
Ossoff went down to defeat in Tuesday's special election for a vacant seat in Georgia's key 6th Congressional District, losing out to Republican Karen Handel with 48 percent of the vote.
Handel, the former secretary of state in Georgia, won by a comfortable margin of 4 percent.
It's something of a miracle, really, considering the massive infusions of campaign funding Ossoff received from many of his political fellow travelers in California, land of rich oddballs in pink pussy hats.
""The young Democrat received 8.9 times as many donors from California than from any other state in the union, including all of the totals from Georgia itself,"" the Daily Caller reports.
California liberals dumped 7,218 private donations into Ossoff's overflowing war chest, although he received a paltry 808 donations inside his own district.
While we absolutely, totally, completely, no-need-to-cross-our-fingers are positive there were no Russians involved to secure victory for Handel, there's ample evidence of California financial meddling.
It's also further proof that while money doesn't buy happiness, it doesn't necessarily buy elections, either. A lot of liberals in California are looking pretty unhappy right about now -- and poorer.
Mmmmmm, LA. Too much for the man....but it wasn't nearly enough to save Jon Ossoff.
What do you think about this story? Do you think money alone can win an election?

KANDAHAR, Afghanistan — In a bloody overnight attack in Afghanistan’s Kandahar Province on Wednesday, the Taliban routed an Afghan Army outpost, killing dozens of soldiers and raising fears of a concerted insurgent offensive in the province, a former seat of Taliban power that took years of effort by coalition and Afghan forces to secure.
The attack happened in Khakrez District, about 30 miles from Kandahar city, and the large number of casualties has raised concerns about new Taliban tactics against an Afghan force already losing men in record numbers.
One senior security official said 39 Afghan Army soldiers were killed in the attack, which began at 10 p.m. on Tuesday and lasted for three hours. The official said 17 other soldiers were wounded, and another dozen have not been accounted for.
The Afghan government’s media and information center said 26 soldiers were killed, and 13 others wounded. Army officials in Kandahar confirmed the attack, but would not provide details of casualties.

Mohammed Yousuf Younusi, a member of Kandahar provincial council, described the episode as “a massacre” and said there was prior intelligence that the Taliban would attack in large numbers.

“The Taliban fooled the officials — they split into three groups, and launched simultaneous attacks. One group attacked Shah Wali Kot District, another attack Nish District, and a third group attacked this Afghan Army base which is not far from the district center,” Mr. Younusi said. “Things are really bad, and this is a shame.”
Kandahar was the original seat of the Taliban regime when it controlled Afghanistan from the mid-1990s until its ouster by the United States invasion in 2001. More than 550 NATO coalition troops have died in the province, and it only became relatively secure after a strong push during President Barack Obama’s troop surge starting in 2010.
The gains in Kandahar have been solidified in recent years by a strongman police chief, Gen. Abdul Raziq, a favorite of American commanders who has also been accused of abuses by human rights groups.
Just how much the security of the province has depended on one individual, with no Plan B and at the cost of reforming the police as an accountable force, has long worried diplomats and Afghan officials.
The Taliban have steadily been making gains in surrounding provinces, but in Kandahar, General Raziq’s forces have long been successful in keeping the insurgents at bay. But the general’s control is now being tested by this new wave attacks.

In recent weeks, in addition to firing on security outposts in most of the province’s districts, the Taliban have also carried out heavier assaults and ambushes in at least six districts, often inflicting casualties on Afghan forces.
“For the last two weeks, the Taliban have been attacking the northern districts of Kandahar and have killed many Afghan security forces,” said Noor Nawaz Piawari, a military analyst in Kandahar. “The northern districts are close to Helmand and Uruzgan, which they control in large parts. They are after expanding their territory to create routes that connect to Pakistan,” where most of the insurgency’s leadership is based.
Mr. Piawari said General Raziq would struggle to maintain security as his police forces are stretched and are receiving casualties, with Taliban often launching attacks on isolated outposts across several districts.
Continue reading the main story
For an Afghan force that lost men in record numbers last year, the past month has proved particularly deadly. The Taliban have overrun three districts across the country in the past week, and the pattern suggests they are focused on inflicting heavy casualties on Afghan forces, rather than holding the territory they take over. When they overrun outposts and police stations, they often capture even more weapons and ammunition, most of it paid for by the United States and its allies to help bolster the Afghan forces.
Both in Janikhel District of Paktia Province, and in Kohistan District of Faryab Province, the Taliban looted all the weapons and equipment left behind by the Afghan forces. In Taiwara district, in western Ghor Province, the Taliban killed as many as 30 government forces.
When Afghan forces took back the district center of Kohistan on Tuesday, they estimated that the Taliban had seized some 40,000 rounds of machine gun ammunition, a mortar with 20 rounds, and 30 rocket-propelled grenades, according to Sulaiman Rahmani, a militia commander in the district. The province’s police chief, however, said that whatever the Taliban took had been bombed by the Afghan air force.
After overrunning the district center of Janikhel, and seizing four pickup trucks, one Humvee, and whatever weapons they could get their hands on, the Taliban withdrew again, officials there said.
“They have taken position in the mountains above the district center to strike on the Afghan forces, in case they plan to move ahead to retake the district,” said Shakeela Mangal, a member of the Paktia provincial council.

McCain makes plea for Senate to return to order
McCain makes plea for Senate to return to order 01:49
* There were moments of drama as Sens. McConnell and Johnson spoke for 10 minutes on the floor before the motion passed
Washington (CNN)All eyes were on the touching yet somber scene unfolding on the Senate floor: A line of senators waiting to greet their colleague John McCain, who stood at his Senate desk hosting an impromptu receiving line.
McCain's speech on the Senate floor (full text and video)
But I couldn't take my eyes off the visitor's gallery above. There sat Cindy McCain, by herself in the front row, clutching a tissue while audibly sniffling as she tried in vain to push back tears as she watched the scene unfold. Even her sunny yellow dress could not mask the reality of the bittersweet moment: her husband's aggressive brain cancer set off a bipartisan parade of colleagues eager to show him respect.
That moment alone was poignant enough, but even more so up against the backdrop of the legislative drama on health care.
I have been inside the Senate chamber to observe several momentous events over the years, from the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton, to the vote to authorize war after 9/11, but the nearly hour long swirl of emotion I witnessed Tuesday afternoon is seared in my memory.
Even before the vote to start debate on Obamacare repeal began, the usual decorum of the Senate chamber was thrown off, thanks to more than a dozen protesters in the visitors' gallery pointing at Senators yelling ""kill the bill"" and ""shame.""
Protesters are not unusual, but what was out of the ordinary was how long it took to get them out. Well after they left, they were so loud that senators could still hear them as the clerk was halfway through the alphabet in the roll call.
So it was a bit hard to hear when West Virginia Republican Shelley Moore Capito, who had opposed this measure last week, reversed course and voted ""yes."" And when, soon after, Maine Republican Susan Collins voted ""no.""
That meant GOP leaders could only afford to lose one more vote.

McConnell: We have a duty to act
McConnell: We have a duty to act 01:27
That's what happened when it was Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski's turn, and she yelled the word ""no.""
Normally when the Senate votes, senators mill around and talk. But on rare occasions -- big votes or speeches -- they sit at their desks. This was one of those occasions, and as luck would have it, Collins and Murkowski's desks are next to each other. You could sense a bit of relief that they had one another to fend off the angry vibes coming from GOP leaders for flouting them -- and the President.
And Democrats used a tactic to make their defiance even more stark. Democrats declined to vote until all Republican senators had cast theirs, so that when the clerk read back the votes so far, the only names that were read were Republicans -- mostly for, but only two against. When their names were called as ""votes in the negative,"" Collins and Murkowski both smiled, as if that was the only expression that seemed appropriate to cut the tension in the air on the GOP side.
But Republican leaders were not yet out of the woods. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, a vocal critic of the process, hadn't shown up yet.
When Johnson finally appeared, the Senate Majority Leader was waiting for him, and the two men proceeded to have a 10-minute intense conversation right in the middle of the Senate floor. Though those of us in the press gallery above couldn't hear what they said, and couldn't see Johnson's face, McConnell's expressions spoke volumes. The usually poker-faced GOP leader grew increasingly red, he crossed his arms, and even wiped his brow as he grew more and more animated.
Meanwhile, the number two Republican, John Cornyn, was standing right next to McConnell and Johnson, shifting his stance, pacing and just generally trying not to look like he was listening.
Other GOP senators also pretended not to notice. A few, like Lindsey Graham and David Perdue, made beelines to Pat Toomey's desk in the back of the room to raid the candy drawer (by tradition, whomever gets that particular desk is tasked with stocking the candy).
It was only the dramatic entrance of John McCain onto the Senate floor that broke the McConnell Johnson tete-a-tete. As soon as McCain walked in, the entire chamber erupted in applause, and Johnson moved away from McConnell to quietly cast a ""yes"" vote under the thunderous ovation for McCain, who also came in and voted yes.
With that, and no vote to spare, Vice President Mike Pence cast the tie-breaker, and declared the vote to start debate approved.
From legislative drama to human drama
Meanwhile, McCain, who was eager to get back in the arena on this big day not just to cast a vote, but to be a statesman with a message to deliver, was at his desk trying not to get overwhelmed by the series of greetings he was receiving.
A handshake here, a pat on the back there, fun loving quips and heartfelt bear hugs from just about all of his colleagues -- from conservative GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, whom McCain sparred with when he first came to the Senate, to liberal Democrat Elizabeth Warren, who got to know McCain tagging along on his famous globe-trotting adventures.
One humorous moment was when Sen. Bernie Sanders walked over to greet McCain, attempting a kind of bro-hug that didn't quite land right -- which turned into a lighter moment as both men laughed.
Republicans just dodged political disaster on health care
Throughout it all, the McCain I have come to know covering him for almost 20 years -- a complicated and compelling man -- was on display. He clearly wanted this moment to come back to the Senate he has loved serving in for 30 years to deliver a very stark warning about how he has seen it go off course. But returning to deliver that message meant coming face to face with all of his colleagues at once for the first time since his cancer diagnosis, and grim prognosis.
And while McCain kept it together, his colleagues on both sides of the aisle, not to mention reporters in the press gallery, had a harder time.
The speech was classic McCain -- written with the help of his long time speechwriter, co-author, and former aide Mark Salter.
And though packed with tough love for colleagues on both sides of the aisle, it was infused with his love for the US Senate, and his country.
""Let's trust each other. Let's return to regular order,"" McCain said. ""We've been spinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle.""

MAKING THE REDSKINS GREAT AGAIN: Trump’s DOJ ends Obama-era challenge to team trademark,"Breaking NewsNews and Politics
 
Victor Medina7 hours ago
The Department of Justice has dropped their fight to cancel the trademark of the NFL’s Washington Redskins. Under the Obama regime, the government patent office had canceled the team’s trademark to the “Redskins” name, saying it was offensive. The team then sued the Obama administration to keep the trademark.
The move was precipitated by a Supreme Court decision in another case, which ruled that trademarks could not be canceled just because someone found it offensive. The decision indicated they would also rule to protect trademarks in other cases, including the Redskins.
A group of Native American activists who had also sued to cancel the Redskins trademark withdrew from the case, stating they believed the Supreme Court would also rule in favor of the Redskins.
President Trump had previously voiced his support for the team’s fight to keep the Redskins trademark.
The Justice Department is giving up the legal fight over the name of the Washington Redskins.
In a letter to a federal appeals court, the department said last week’s Supreme Court decision in favor of an Asian-American band calling itself the Slants means the NFL team will prevail in a legal battle to cancel the team’s trademarks because the name is disparaging to Native Americans.
Mark Freeman, an attorney for the Justice Department’s civil division, wrote on Wednesday to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals that the court “should reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case with instructions to enter judgment in favor of Pro-Football.”
TRENDING ON  
The Redskins case had been on hold in the federal appeals court while the Slants decision was rendered.
Thursday also saw Native Americans who brought a trademark lawsuit against the team agree that the recent Supreme Court ruling means the case is over. In a letter to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, Jesse Witten, an attorney who represents several of the Native Americans, says there is no need for oral arguments in the case.

Police: Video shows no one left home hours before shooting,"June 22, 2017 8:48 PM
 
Seattle police say surveillance video from the hallway outside Charleena Lyles' apartment shows that she never left her apartment and no one entered in the 24 hours before Sunday's shooting that left the pregnant mother dead.
The Seattle Times reports (https://goo.gl/atTsw6 ) police released the surveillance video Thursday along with audio of Lyles' 911 call asking for an officer to respond to her apartment for a break-in.
The mother of four said in the 911 call that she had gone out and come home to find someone had broken in.
But Sgt. Sean Whitcomb said a review of surveillance video shows no one entered the apartment until Officers Steven McNew and Jason Anderson arrived.
Police say officers fatally shot Lyles after she confronted them with two knives.
Lyles' family attorney James Bible criticized the release of the video and questioned the department's motives.

"What to do about the ""stalemate"" in Afghanistan","CBS NewsJuly 25, 2017, 1:58 PM
Michèle Flournoy on Afghanistan: ""Nobody's gonna win this on the battlefield""
America's longest war is approaching its 17th year.
As part of our series, Issues That Matter, we took a closer look at the conflict in Afghanistan with Michèle Flournoy, who served as undersecretary of defense for policy under President Obama from 2009 to 2012.
""The real issue here is a political strategy,"" Flournoy told ""CBS This Morning"" Tuesday. Flournoy is also the co-founder and CEO of the Center for a New American Security.
The war in Afghanistan was launched on October 7, 2001 in response to the September 11 attacks.
""I think first of all, the Taliban has proven to be a very resilient insurgency. They have support from Pakistan, they have support from outside countries. We've had an Afghan government that's been very weak and really plagued by corruption. And we, too, have made mistakes,"" Flournoy said.
Flournoy pointed to the years from 2003 to 2009 when she says the U.S. focus was largely switched to Iraq.
""When President Obama came in and launched the surge [of U.S. troops in Afghanistan] in 2009, that was important to regaining momentum, but he also announced that that surge would only last a short while -- about less than two years -- and so the Taliban had the signal, you know, we can just wait this out,"" Flournoy said.
Defense Secretary James Mattis told a Senate committee last month the United States is not winning the war. Flournoy doesn't disagree.
""It's really a stalemate at this point. The good news is that the Afghan forces are in the lead and with our support they continue to hold their own, but they do need our continued support,"" Flournoy said.
Americans in Afghanistan to help train fighters
U.S. Marines are returning to Afghanistan to fight for territory they once held. About 350 marines died in Helmand Province fighting against the ...
""The real issue here is a political strategy. How do we use that leverage of additional troops supporting the Afghans to actually get the Taliban to the negotiating table. Nobody's gonna win this on the battlefield.""
Asked how much territory the Taliban controls now compared to 9/11, Flournoy said, ""It controls more now than when we first started the war.""
""We have evidence that Russia's proving small arms to the Taliban. Also Iran. So we have this problem of outside support,"" Flournoy said.
She said the countries providing support are ""hedging their bets"" in case the Taliban wins, but it also provides them a chance to ""poke the United States.""
The Trump administration is reviewing U.S. policy on Afghanistan and in comments last week, the president said, ""I want to find out why we've been there for 17 years.""
What does Flournoy think officials should consider? ""What I think we want to see coming out of the Trump administration is a very clear statement of commitment. Look, we have to remember, why are we there? We are there because we don't want Afghanistan to once again become a safe haven for terrorists that could strike the United States,"" Flournoy said. ""The last thing we want is for ISIS to pick up and move from Syria to Afghanistan because we're not pushing back hard enough.""
Asked what Trump should do, Flournoy said, ""I think the most important thing beyond the troop numbers is a political strategy -- you have to have a broader strategy into which the military portion fits. You have to have a way to get the Taliban to the table.""
""The U.S. has to signal a long-term commitment to Afghanistan as a partner for fighting terrorism in the region. If there's any waffling, any sense that we're not fully committed the Taliban will continue to wait us out,"" Flournoy said.

Illegal Immigrants Will Not Stop Until America Is A Third World Hellhole,"San Francisco’s liberal politics are so warped that residents may as well be living in an alternate reality. According to reports, an illegal from El Salvador has been awarded a six-figure settlement after complaining in court that city violated its “sanctuary” status by alerting immigration authorities to his presence.
$190,000. That’s how much San Francisco lawyers have determined to pay Pedro Figueroa-Zarceno. The average American worker would need to save 100 percent of his income for more than for years in order to accrue an equivalent amount of cash.
“That is beyond backwards. That is perverse,” Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, said. “Talk about an incentive to come here illegally. I just can’t wrap my head around that.”
San Francisco might have enough spare cash lying around that they’re willing to settle frivolous complaints but most American cities can’t afford to give hundreds of thousands of dollars to any illegal who happens to be camped within.
Unfortunately, San Francisco isn’t the only city defying federal law by offering sanctuary to illegals. Dozens of cities could be on the hook if illegals start successfully suing when they’re reported to authorities.
“It just goes to show the extent to which San Francisco city officials are willing to go to support their own sanctuary policies,” Joseph Guzzardi, a spokesman for Californians for Population Stabilization, said. “It’s completely and totally an assault on taxpayers and not justifiable in any way.”
Honest taxpayers, people who might be struggling to feed their own families, are being forced to foot the bill for exorbitant payments to illegals. It’s sickening. If liberals really cared about pumping more funds into social services they would be willing to stop throwing money at undocumented migrants. The $190,000 paid to Figueroa-Zarceno could have put multiple students through college. It could have provided shelter for numerous families or food for thousands.
According to Fox News: “San Francisco adopted its sanctuary policy in 1989, becoming one of the first jurisdictions in the country to prohibit police from cooperating with federal officials on immigration enforcement.”
San Francisco has been a cesspool for backward ideas for a long time.","Yes, I’m Right",1
‘We need to survive his presidency’: Pink Floyd’s Roger Waters blasts ‘buffoon’ Trump — and the media covering him,"15 Jul 2017 at 10:30 ET
Roger Waters --CNN screengrab
Don't miss stories. Follow Raw Story!
Appearing on CNN Saturday morning, former Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters tore into President Donald Trump — and the media covering him — while pondering if we are going to survive a Trump presidency.
Speaking with host Michael Smerconish, Waters talked about his latest tour that features copious images of Trump — and not in a flattering way.
Smerconish asked about the anti-Trump imagery and if the rocker was running “the risk of helping him by going over the top.”
“No, I don’t think help or hindering,” Waters patiently replied. “What we need to survive his presidency, because it’s totally unpredictable. I don’t think he knows what he’s going to do.”
“I’m thinking of a few cultural touchstones recently,” Smerconish asked. “I’m thinking of the Kathy Griffin ISIS-inspired photograph she tweeted. I’m thinking of the Caesar play in Central Park. It occurs to me it plays into his hand in as far as he gets to say, ‘look at these leaders against me.’ He’s somewhat inoculated from it.”
“Well, maybe. This is the responsibility that you and the mainstream media have is to not allow this to be taken as seriously as it is,” Water shot back. “I mean, I’ve sort of stopped watching all the talking heads about Russia-gate and this and that and the other because it seems to me largely irrelevant. There’s a larger picture that we could maybe all be focusing on. The problem is entertainment has got mixed up with news a lot in this country, my general sense is that everything has to be entertaining. And in consequence Donald Trump is great for the mainstream media because he’s such a buffoon.”

Marco Rubio and Nancy Pelosi rarely see eye to eye.
But both the liberal Democratic leader from San Francisco and the conservative Republican senator from Miami agree on one thing: Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is a brutal dictator.
“The President of Venezuela, to me, looks like he’s a thug and we just can’t let them exploit poor people in the country ... with a message that looks like he’s their champion,” House Minority Leader Pelosi said.
Ahead of a vote Sunday that could dramatically change Venezuela’s constitution in favor of Maduro, the tough talk from Pelosi and other liberal Democrats now mirrors the rhetoric of Miami Republicans who have long opposed Caracas.
As a result, any sympathy towards Maduro in Washington, even among liberal Democrats who once praised the leadership of Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez, has vanished.
Members of Congress who maintained a dialogue with Caracas during Chávez’s administration no longer speak to Maduro.
The leadership of the Washington-based Organization of American States is demanding free and fair elections.
And the White House has declared that the U.S. “will take strong and swift economic actions” if the Maduro regime goes ahead with the vote Sunday.
For pro-Venezuela politicians and diplomats in Washington, Chávez’s commitment to the country’s 1999 constitution was a redeeming characteristic for a leader who trafficked in anti-U.S. rhetoric during his 14 years in power.
“I’ve known Chávez and Maduro. Anytime we met, [Chávez] would always go into his pocket and bring out the constitution of Venezuela,” said U.S. Rep. Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat and the only sitting member of Congress who attended Chávez’s funeral in 2013. “Unfortunately, what Maduro is doing is tearing up the constitution.”
Meeks maintained regular contact with Caracas even as Chávez accused the U.S. of orchestrating a failed 2002 coup and referred to former President George W. Bush as “the devil” in 2006.
But Maduro’s decision to annul the Venezuelan legislature in March, and widespread protests that have led to the deaths of more than 100 people, are too much to reconcile.
“He doesn’t seem to me to be the same guy that I knew when he was the leader of the Parliament back when I first met him with Hugo Chávez or the individual I spoke with briefly after he became president,” Meeks said.
He added that his conversation with Maduro in 2013 was about “getting diplomatic relationships going again.”
But something changed between 2013 and 2015, when Maduro arrested opposition leader Leopoldo López and began suspending democratic norms.
“It seems to me at some point, I don’t know what happened, that he was not interested in having further dialogue, he’s not the same guy,” Meeks said. “Something has to happen to change what has been going on for years now. The lines have been crossed and there’s no attempt at trying to have reconciliation.”
That wasn’t the case years ago, when Chávez enjoyed amicable relations with U.S. officials appointed by President Bill Clinton in the late 1990s.
“The name of the game was to engage,” said John Maisto, U.S. ambassador to Venezuela from 1997 to 2000.
Maisto said that despite Chávez’s antagonistic rhetoric toward business interests and the United States, he was deeply committed to Article 350 of the Venezuelan constitution, which states that “the Venezuelan people will not recognize any regime, legislation or authority that runs counter to democratic values, principles and guarantees, or undermines human rights.”
Protesters, including a man who attacked government buildings with a helicopter in June, have said Maduro is disregarding Article 350.
“The current regime is blatantly violating the constitution by not having local elections, by not having referenda ... by trampling separation of powers and the non-recognition of the legislature,” Maisto said. “They are crossing a red line.”
The Sunday vote could lead to wide sanctions from the White House.
While liberal Democrats in Washington still oppose sweeping economic sanctions on Venezuelan oil imports, there is a sense that Maduro is an autocrat compared to Chávez, a hard-talking socialist who nonetheless respected democratic norms.
“He’s not Chávez, he’s not Chávez by any means,” said Arizona Democratic Rep. Raúl Grijalva, one of 14 liberal Democrats who signed a letter in May 2014 urging then President Barack Obama to accept Maduro’s offer of restoring diplomatic relationships months after Maduro expelled three U.S. ambassadors for “promoting violence.”
“Maduro ... as he hardens, he separates himself more and more from that populist image that Chávez had, the democratic image, which is not good,” Grijalva said.
Despite the Venezuelan government spending $1.3 million to lobby Congress in 2017, no one is offering a hint of a kind word towards Maduro.
“I’m very concerned about the deteriorating human rights situation, the crackdown of political opposition and the crackdown on civil liberties and freedoms,” said Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern, who also signed the May 2014 letter.
McGovern, like most liberal Democrats and some Republicans, doesn’t want to impose oil sanctions on Caracas and prefers a diplomatic solution negotiated by Venezuela’s neighbors and Pope Francis, but said, “I’m not a big fan of Maduro.”
On Friday, eight congressional Democrats, including McGovern, sent a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arguing that mediation led by Uruguay and the Caribbean is preferable to sanctions on Caracas.
“We would point out that U.S. unilateral sanctions in effect since 2015 have done nothing to improve the political situation in the country,” the letter reads. “Instead, they were successfully exploited by the government to stoke nationalist resentment against U.S. imperialism.”
But the letter didn’t have any positive words for Maduro, calling Sunday’s constituent assembly vote “a highly unpopular move seen by many as a tactic to consolidate power.”
Meeks also said that any economic sanctions on Venezuela should be done in concert with other countries in the region like Colombia, and that Trump should meet with the leaders of Latin American countries to make a strong multilateral stand against Maduro.
“As a result of his actions the people of Venezuela suffer,” Meeks said.
Pelosi agrees with that sentiment, and hopes that more people in the U.S. will pay attention to the situation in Venezuela if Maduro gets his way and rewrites the constitution after Sunday’s vote.
“I’m hoping that ... the American people would see what’s happening to undermine the system of democracy there,” Pelosi said. “I was in Venezuela a few years ago in the previous administration, which we thought was really bad, and now this is worse.”

Trump blocked transgender troops after pressure from a GOP congresswoman,"“I’m pleased to hear that President Trump shares my readiness and cost concerns, and I’m glad the president will be changing this costly and damaging policy,” U.S. Rep.

President Donald Trump’s decision to restrict transgender troops in the military comes after weeks of pressure from U.S. Rep. Vicky Hartzler of Missouri.
Trump announced Wednesday morning on Twitter that after consulting with his generals, he had decided to no longer allow transgender individuals to serve in the military in any capacity, saying that the military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.”
After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow......
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017
....Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming.....
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017
....victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017
Hartzler, a Republican whose district covers central and western Missouri, has pushed for weeks to reverse an Obama administration policy that enabled transgender troops to undergo sex reassignment surgery and continue to serve.
Trump’s comments echoed Hartzler, who has framed her opposition to transgender troops as stemming from concerns about medical costs. Hartzler said she had not spoken directly with the president but did have discussions with White House officials prior to Trump’s announcement.
“I think we raised the awareness for people all across this country of this failed Obama policy that had been inflicted on our military last year and the dangers to both our readiness as well as our ability to spend our precious defense dollars to meet the threat,” Hartzler said in a phone call Wednesday. “And so I think the ensuing discussions that developed and the ensuing outrage for people all across America ... helped propel this decision today.”
A study by the Rand Corp. last year estimated that 1,320 to 6,630 of the military’s 1.3 million active service members were transgender but that not all of them would seek surgery. The study found that covering hormone treatments and sex reassignment surgeries for transgender troops would result in a 0.13 percent health care cost increase for the military.
Hartzler had offered an amendment to the defense budget in June to completely block transgender troops from serving.
She withdrew the amendment after saying that she wanted to give the Defense Department an opportunity to address the issue internally. In July, she offered a scaled-down version of the amendment that would’ve blocked the military from paying the medical costs for transgender troops’ transitions.
Allison Jaslow, the executive director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, noted that the House rejected Hartzler’s amendment earlier this month.
“It’s kind of a surprise that when the people’s House wasn’t going to accept this kind of intolerance, now our president is,” said Jaslow, a retired Army captain who served two tours in Iraq and attended the University of Central Missouri, which is in Hartzler’s district.
U.S. Rep. Kevin Yoder, an Overland Park Republican, supported Hartzler’s amendment to prevent the military from paying for transgender troops’ surgeries earlier this month, but he said Wednesday that he opposed the president’s decision to enact a total ban on transgender troops.
“In an era where the United States depends on a voluntary fighting force to protect our freedoms, anyone who wants to serve our country should be able to,” Yoder said. “But I believe taxpayer dollars should not be spent on gender reassignment therapies or surgeries.”
Trump’s decision to institute a complete ban on transgender troops is closer to Hartzler’s original amendment.
“He’s doing what the vast majority of people in America want as well as military leaders,” Hartzler said. “So I’m very pleased that he listened and he acted decisively and will help restore our military’s readiness.”
Since October, transgender troops have been able to receive sex transition medical care through military services. They also could begin to formally change their sex identification in the Pentagon’s personnel system. The Obama administration had set a deadline of July 1, 2017, for the Pentagon to develop guidelines to allow transgender individuals to join the military if they met physical and medical standards.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis recently delayed a decision on the guidelines by six months to “evaluate more carefully the impact” of allowing transgender recruits on military readiness. It was unclear why the president pushed forward Wednesday, especially as it wasn’t high on the Pentagon’s priority list.
The Pentagon appeared caught off guard by Trump’s announcement, which came while Mattis was on vacation. Facing a barrage of questions, Pentagon spokespeople told reporters to “call the White House.” The White House did not respond to requests for comment.
As of Wednesday morning, the Defense Department website still carried the Obama-era policy, stating: “Effective immediately, transgender service members may serve openly, and they can no longer be discharged or otherwise separated from the military solely for being transgender individuals.”
Jaslow said Trump’s announcement creates uncertainty for the thousands of transgender troops now serving.
“My heart breaks for any of our transgender troops right now who currently are being allowed to serve openly who now need to fear not just whether they are accepted by their commander in chief but also whether a career that they love needs to come to an end,” said Jaslow, who had to keep her own sexual orientation private while serving because of the now-repealed Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy.
“I don’t even know if they have an option to go backward,” Jaslow said of transgender troops.
Promo, Missouri’s leading LGBT rights group, compared Trump’s promise to earlier bans on gay troops.
“We have seen throughout history that an inclusive military is what makes an effective force, and that is still true today. We hope leadership across the U.S. military will continue to follow the current policy that allows those who serve to serve openly with honor and integrity,” said Steph Perkins, the group’s executive director.
Hartzler compared the policy to restrictions against service because of medical conditions.
“I’ve had other outstanding young people in my district who were denied serving due to having asthma or flat feet, so it’s important that we be consistent in our policy and make sure that every soldier who is able to enter the service will be able to deploy and serve if called upon,” Hartzler said.
Trump’s announcement was lauded by social conservatives in the Kansas City region. Phillip Cosby, the director of American Family Action of Kansas and Missouri, said he agreed with the president about the need to avoid “social experimentation” in the military.
“Transgenderism is not a science. It’s not good biology. It’s feelings,” Cosby said. “Social experimentation is a detractor to good order and discipline in the military, and in these dangerous times gender confusion will not help their mission.”
U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and chairman the congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, noted the president’s previous promises to safeguard LGBT rights and said that “Trump’s anti-transgender pronouncement is ugly and wrong because discrimination is never patriotic; allowing all who love this country to serve is.”

Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban accuses George Soros of wanting to “Muslimize Europe”,"Alex Christoforou11 hours agoJuly 24, 2017 99
During a speech in Romania, Viktor Orban accused George Soros and the European Union of wanting to “Muslimize Europe.”
Last week   reported on Israel’s foreign ministry issuing a statement denouncing globalist George Soros, calling the regime change billionaire “a threat.”
Reuters reported on the statement…
Israel’s foreign ministry has issued a statement denouncing U.S. billionaire George Soros, a move that appeared designed to align Israel more closely with Hungary ahead of a visit to Budapest next week by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Soros, a Hungarian-born Jew who has spent a large part of his fortune funding pro-democracy and human rights groups, has repeatedly been targeted by Hungary’s right-wing government, in particular over his support for more open immigration.
In the latest case, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has backed a campaign in which Soros is singled out as an enemy of the state. “Let’s not allow Soros to have the last laugh” say billboards next to a picture of the 86-year-old investor, a campaign that Jewish groups and others say foments anti-Semitism.
Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been fighting a Soros sponsored incursion into his government for years, reaching a boiling point in April after Hungarian Parliament passed a law targeting the billionaire’s Central European University…which is one of Soros’ many “NGO like” covers to instigate regime change initiatives.
During a recent speech in Romania, the Hungarian PM accused Soros and the European Union, of wanting to “Muslimize Europe.”
The Associated Press reports…
European Union leaders and Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros are seeking a “new, mixed, Muslimized Europe,” Hungary’s anti-migration prime minister said Saturday.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban said during a visit to Romania that Hungary’s border fences, supported by other Central European countries, will block the EU-Soros effort to increase Muslim migration into Europe.
While Hungary opposed taking in migrants “who could change the country’s cultural identity,” Orban said under his leadership, Hungary would remain a place where “Western European Christians will always be able to find security.”
Orban, who will seek a fourth term in April 2018, said Hungary’s opposition parties were no match for his government.
“In the upcoming campaign, first of all we have to confront external powers,” Orban said at a cultural festival in Baile Tusnad, Romania. “We have to stand our ground against the Soros mafia network and the Brussels bureaucrats. And, during the next nine months, we will have to fight against the media they operate.”
Soros has become a key target of Orban and his government.
Recent legislation in Hungary seeks to close or expel the Budapest-based Central European University, founded by Soros in 1991. There are also new rules about non-governmental organizations funded at least partly from abroad – which critics say stigmatize the NGOs, many of which are backed by Soros’ Open Society Foundations.",The Duran,1
PANDORA’S BOX: Devin Nunes Just Leaked The One Thing That’ll Bring Obama Down,"Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) just revealed something huge about the Obama administration. They apparently made hundreds of unmasking requests without any justification during the 2016 Presidential election.
According to the Hill, Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif) in a letter to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats outlined that there were multiple requests made to unmask people for political reasons without any justification on why the info was needed.
Remember what Susan Rice said: “I leaked nothing to nobody.”
“We have found evidence that current and former government officials had easy access to U.S. person information and that it is possible that they used this information to achieve partisan political purposes, including the selective, anonymous leaking of such information,” Nunes wrote in the letter to Coats.
Susan Rice and CIA John Brennan said that they made such requests, according to the Hill. But, they both decline to acknowledge whether making the requests were for legitimate work reasons.
Nunes says that during Obama’s last year in office, hundreds of unmasking requests by Obama aides for Americans came through. He claims that they didn’t have much justification for the unmasking.
“The committee has learned that one official, whose position had no apparent intelligence related function, made hundreds of unmasking requests during the final year of the Obama administration,” Nunes wrote. “Of those requests, only one offered a justification that was not boilerplate.”
This needs to get out immediately, the press will not cover it. Share this because the media is trying to cover it up. We cannot let this get shot down by the media.

The Best Diary Entry Ever. Who Said Living In Texas Was Easy?,"June 1st: Just moved to Texas! Now this is a state that knows how to live!! Beautiful sunny days and warm balmy evenings. What a place! It is beautiful. I’ve finally found my home. I love it here.
Really heating up. Got to 100 today. Not a problem. Live in an Air-conditioned home, drive an air-conditioned car. What a pleasure to see the sun everyday like this. I’m turning into a sun worshiper.
Had the backyard landscaped with western plants today. Lots of cactus and rocks. What a breeze to maintain. No more mowing the lawn for me. Another scorcher today, but I love it here.
The temperature hasn’t been below 100 all week. How do people get used to this kind of heat? At least, it’s kind of windy though. But getting used to the heat is taking longer than I expected.
Fell asleep by the community pool. (Got 3rd degree burns over 60% of my body). Missed 3 days of work. What a dumb thing to do. I learned my lesson though. Got to respect the ole sun in a climate like this.
I missed Lomita (my cat) sneaking into the car when I left this morning. By the time I got to the hot car at noon, Lomita had died and swollen up to the size of a shopping bag, then popped like a water balloon. The car now smells like Kibbles and ****s. I learned my lesson though. No more pets in this heat. Good ole Mr. Sun strikes again.
The wind sucks. It feels like a giant freaking blow dryer!! And it’s hot as hell. The home air-conditioner is on the fritz and the AC repairman charged $200 just to drive by and tell me he needed to order parts.
Been sleeping outside on the patio for 3 nights now, $225,000 house and I can’t even go inside. Lomita is the lucky one. Why did I ever come here?
It’s 115 degrees. Finally got the air-conditioner fixed today. It cost $500 and gets the temperature down to 85. I hate this stupid state.
If another wisea** cracks, ‘Hot enough for you today?’ I’m going to strangle him. Damn heat. By the time I get to work, the radiator is boiling over, my clothes are soaking wet, and I smell like baked cat!!
Tried to run some errands after work. Wore shorts, and when sat on the seats in the car, I thought my ass was on fire. My skin melted to the seat. I lost 2 layers of flesh and all the hair on the back of my legs and ass… Now my car smells like burnt hair, fried ass, and baked cat.
The weather report might as well be a damn recording. Hot and sunny. Sunny and hot. Hot and sunny. It’s been too hot to do s*** for over a damn month and the weatherman says it might really warm up next week. Doesn’t it ever rain in this damn state? Water rationing will be next, so my $1700 worth of cactus will just dry up and blow over. Even the cactus can’t live in this damn heat.
Welcome to HELL! Temperature got to 115 today. Cactus are dead. Forgot to crack the window and blew the damn windshield out of the car. The installer came to fix it and guess what he asked me??? “Hot enough for you today?” My sister had to spend $1,500 to bail me out of jail. Freaking Texas.

No 3rd trial for former Ohio police officer who killed motorist,"July 18 (UPI) -- A Cincinnati prosecutor announced Tuesday he will not seek a third trial for former police officer Ray Tensing, who shot a motorist to death two years ago.
In late June, jurors could not reach a unanimous verdict on murder or voluntary manslaughter charges against Ray Tensing in the death of Sam DuBose. Tensing's first trial also ended in a deadlocked jury in November.
Hamilton County prosecutor Joe Deters said he didn't feel he would be able to convict Tensing.
""After discussing this matter with multiple jurors -- both black and white -- they have, to a person, said to us that we will never be able to get a conviction in this case,"" Deters told NBC News. ""I have an ethical duty as prosecuting attorney of this county, if we believe we cannot be successful at trial we have that duty not to proceed.""
Deter said he remained convinced the white officer committed a crime against the black driver.
""My opinion of this case has not changed as of two years tomorrow, and it is not going to change,"" Deters told The Cincinnati Enquirer.
""We left nothing on the table. It's incredibly disappointing, professionally. It's disappointing personally. My heart breaks for the DuBose family.""
Also Tuesday, U.S. Attorney Benjamin Glassman announced his office is reviewing the case to determine whether to pursue federal civil rights charges against Tensing.
""I think there's a much better chance for conviction than for us on the evidentiary rules that we got,"" Deters told WCPO-TV.
Judge Leslie Ghiz banned potential racial bias evidence in the second trial: The Confederate flag T-shirt that Tensing wore under his uniform when he shot DuBose and the fact that 83.5 percent of his tickets were issued to minority drivers.
Ten white jurors and two black jurors participated in the first Tensing trial, and the second trial had nine white jurors and three black jurors.
Because of the federal investigation, Tensing's attorney, Stew Mathews, was tepid in his comments. He said Tensing ""is somewhat relieved he's not going to have to go this process again in Hamilton County. But it's still not over.""
In the second case, Mathews said the jury voted 8-4 to acquit on murder and 7-5 to acquit on voluntary manslaughter. In the first case, that jury voted 8-4 to convict on the manslaughter charge, Deters said.
Tensing, a former officer in the University of Cincinnati Police Department, shot DuBose on July 19, 2015, after a traffic stop turned confrontational. DuBose attempted to drive away when Tensing asked whether he had a valid driver's license. The entire incident was recorded on Tensing's body camera.
Tensing, 27, has claimed that he feared for his safety when DuBose, 43, tried to drive off and the officer's arm was caught inside the vehicle. Prosecutors argued that deadly force wasn't unnecessary.
Terina Allen, DuBose's sister, read from a letter the family delivered to Deters: ""Tensing should never walk free again. And Tensing should know, we ain't done with you.""",United Press International – US,0
"Putin And Trump Discussed Election Interference, Ukraine, Syria And Fighting Terrorism","Home Uncategorized  
 
President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met on the sidelines of the G20 summit Friday for more than two hours and discussed alleged Russian election interference, Ukraine, Syria and fighting terrorism.
This marked the first time the two world leaders met, and their meeting lasted 95 minutes longer than the 30 minutes that were originally scheduled.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters that Trump opened the meeting by asking about alleged Russian election interference and that him and Putin had a “lengthy and robust” discussion about it. Tillerson said that Putin “denied such involvement,” and the secretary of state described this as a “significant hindrance” in the relationship between the two nations.
Russia’s foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, however, said that Trump accepted these assurances from Putin.
Tillerson told reporters that the two leaders are focused on looking forward, and that the “relationship is too important to not find a way forward.” He did add that the U.S. will work to get a “commitment” from Russia that they will not interfere in the elections of the U.S. or others.

White College Employees Fired for Parody Rap Album Cover,"July 25, 2017July 25, 2017 Christopher Kemmett 0 Comments
In the latest incident of race-fueled hysteria on American college campuses, three employees at Indiana’s Grace College and Seminary have been fired after they posed as rappers for a parody album cover.
Grace’s marketing department holds a weekly “theme day” for employees, encouraging staff to be fun and festive. On June 2, the theme was “wrap day,” where lettuce wraps were served for lunch and employees were asked to dress up as rap musicians.
Five Grace employees, however, took things to the next level and created a parody rap album cover, donning fake gold chains and “Thug Life” tattoos, while one employee wore an Afro wig. (For a parody, it actually looked pretty good!) The letters “N.G.A.” appear in the corner of the album cover, playfully referencing a term coined by Grace students: “Not Grace Approved,” and also parodying a real hip hop outfit from California, N.W.A.
One would think students at Grace would appreciate the staff’s willingness to participate in the festivities, having fun with the theme and going far above what was expected of them, but one would be mistaken in this age of Social Justice activism.
Soon there was backlash. The employees’ offense? They are white, the aggrieved howled. One Facebook commenter said the employees all enjoy privilege.
Forget that white artists and producers have been an integral part of hip hop from early in the genre’s history; according to the chorus of outrage that erupted from Grace’s student body, hip hop should be off-limits to white folks—or at least it’s hard to interpret the incident any other way.
“What point are you trying to make?” asked another commenter. “That you’re gangster, thug, or hood? […] [T]he only time [those terms] seem to be okay is when white people use them to make light or fun of the situation.”
Perhaps Grace needs a new prerequisite course in satire and parody, as the above responses completely, painfully, miss the fact that the photo was taken in the spirit of humor and silliness.
Three of the five who took part in the photo were fired, including Evan Kilgore, a recently-graduated Grace alum. It isn’t clear why the college decided to fire some and not others.
“I am feeling overwhelmed and hurt,” Kilgore told IndyStar soon after his termination. “We thought it would be a funny parody of the Grace College culture.”
Grace’s President, Dr. Bill Katip, issued a statement calling the picture “insensitive and inappropriate.”
“It is important for the public to know that Grace College is committed deeply to diversity and inclusiveness, and conduct that demonstrates insensitivity to these values will not be tolerated,” the statement read. “Grace leadership has taken steps to ensure that this sort of incident will not recur, and several of the individuals involved are no longer employees of Grace College.”
The incident is one in a long line of recent race-related controversies at American colleges, such as the uproar over Halloween costumes on several campuses last year.
“June 15 would have been my one-year anniversary. I do not believe this was handled in the most graceful manner,” Kilgore said, making a probably-unintentional pun.
Hopefully somebody informed the humor police at Grace of this latest infraction.

Man Stuck Inside Of ATM Begs For Help As People Think He’s Just Pranking,"Posted by Asia Mayfield | Jul 17, 2017 | American Strength
Customers thought it was a prank when the ATM begin spitting out help notes instead of receipts. In fact, it wasn’t a joke at all. A man, contractor James Portillo, was trapped.
James Portillo’s work mishap has become international news. The Texas contractor accidentally trapped himself inside an ATM last week, forcing bank customers to call for help.
Hoping to save himself, Portillo slipped a small note to the first woman who used the machine. Instead of her bank balance, the paper that slipped out of the receipt slot read “Please help…”
“I was, uh, working on the door, and, uh, as I unlocked the door, as I put in the lock on the door, I walked in. As I walked in, my drill fell out of my hand. When my drill fell out of my hand, the door closed, because I bent over to pick up my drill,” Portillo told KRIS 6 News.
“When the door closed, the door jammed shut. I could not pry the door open from inside. The door was hung up on the metal, and there was no way for me to get out.”
The note, originating as it did from an ATM receipt slot, was thought to be a joke. Portillo spent hours waiting for help.
He didn’t panic. He made various attempts to free himself, but none were successful. He had no way to contact anybody he worked with, nor could he alert the bank. His only hope was that a customer might save him.
“I set off the alarms in the ATM room and, tried to get out that way, I mean, I gave it a couple of hours. I realized I didn’t have my phone, because it was charging in my truck, which was the biggest mistake I made that day,” Portillo said. “And uh, I went into the ATM machine, tried to figure out a way out of there, and set off those alarms. Obviously, the police came, but they couldn’t get into the room.”
Portillo originally hid his identity, but as the story continued to pick up speed he decided to break his silence. It was an honest mistake, and nobody was hurt.
However, Portillo insisted to reporters that he was terrified during the ordeal itself. He couldn’t think about it calmly until hours later.
The officer pictured led the effort to rescue from Portillo from the ATM.
“I couldn’t, I mean, I knew I had a time frame because there was a guy who let me in and he was getting out of work at 5:00. So, if I didn’t get out by 5:00, there was only one person who knew I was there, and, you know, they weren’t going to be able to contact him to get me out of the room,” he said.
So he decided to write a note. He knew that he would be able to pass his note to someone who used the machine, but he didn’t know what would happen next.
“I looked around, and I never have anything to write with me, on me, on my person, and, you know, I had a knife on me, I figured, you know, I’d just cut myself and write on it like that. And I looked down and I had a pen in my pocket. Thank god I had a pen in my pocket for some reason,” he said.
Customers might have been wary of believing Portillo’s note because of the recent rise in ATM-related crimes. Sophisticated thieves have learned how to glean your card information when from your swipe.
He scribbled a note and successfully passed it to a customer, but the situation proved to be too unbelievable. That person read the note and laughed, clearly not taking it seriously.
“So I wrote on the notes and, the first person took it and kinda laughed and just took off on me, which was, kinda bizarre for me. Once they took the note, I was like, oh-because my pen was running out of ink and I had to lick the pen so it would write. I only had one note. So, I was like, ‘oh, my god, they took off on me.'”
Luckily, Portillo was eventually able to reach a more credulous person. He was rescued after being trapped for almost three hours.",Conservative Daily Post,1
Dear NeverTrumpers: Trump Signs VA Accountability Act – How Will You Disparage That?,"Published on June 23, 2017
 
Since the media (D) finds the dark cloud for every silver lining … how are they going to spin the VA Accountability Act as ‘bad’?
The hyper-critical media have to work hard to do that.
Becuase the bipartisan legislation is actually pretty good.
To the Verardos, the moment will signal a promise kept.
“We’ve been fighting for VA reform and accountability, and we feel that it was championed under candidate Trump. We got to know him, his family, and learned how important VA reform was to him,” Sarah Verardo said. “We are really excited. I’m so relieved and glad to see this.”
After three years of attempting to pass similar legislation, Congress sent the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 to Trump on June 13.
Shulkin, many veterans and other supporters of the bill said it will serve to root out poor-performing employees and a perceived culture of corruption in the department, which is the government’s second-largest with approximately 350,000 people on its payroll.
…More than a dozen large veterans groups spoke in support of the bill.
Under the current disciplinary process, it takes an average 51 days to remove an employee, largely due to a 30-day notice period, Shulkin said. — Stars And Stripes
Local Veterans Groups Praised it:
The VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act won Congressional approval Tuesday.
The House cleared the bill, 368-55, replacing an earlier version that Democrats had criticized as overly unfair to workers. The Senate passed the bipartisan legislation by voice vote last week. It will go to Trump later this week for his signature.
Ernie Rumbsy, president of the Tri-Cities Military Affairs Council, and American Legion Commander Bryan Louzon said they support the legislation that will keep VA workers held to their responsibilities.
“If an employee is doing their job, that employee shouldn’t have anything to worry about,” said Rumbsy, who said he, like thousands of other veterans, uses the VA to receive care.
“If they’re not doing a good job, the VA’s hands shouldn’t be tied if they can’t get rid of a bad employee.”
The Military Affairs Council is a non-profit organization that advocates for “military and veteran affairs in Northeast Tennessee as they relate to national defense and economic vitality of the area,” according to the group’s website. That includes being a liaison for veterans seeking to overcome obstacles in obtaining access to the VA. –read more
What was the problem that needed fixing? Here’s ONE example:
Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin said Wednesday the civil service appeals process prevents the agency from firing “terrible managers,” and that the Senate must act to reduce the impact of the Merit Systems Protection Board and excessive government employee union-backed due process requirements.
“Just last week we were forced to take back an employee after they were convicted no more than three times for DWI and had served a 60-day jail sentence … Our accountability processes are clearly broken,” Shulkin said at the White House.
…“We had to wait more than a month to fire a psychiatrist who was caught on camera watching pornography on his iPad while seeing a patient,” he said. “Because of the way judges review these cases, they can force us to take terrible managers back who were fired for poor performance, we recently saw that with one of our executives in San Juan.”
…“We currently have 1,500 disciplinary actions pending, people that either need to be fired, demoted, suspended without paid for violating our core values,” Shulkin said. —DailySignal
Is there REALLY an objection to firing people like that?
With the VA hospital waiting lines looking like the DMV — or worse — the Canadian ‘Health Care’ System … we owe a lot more to our veterans than we do for a bureaucrat who doesn’t take his responsibilities seriously.
